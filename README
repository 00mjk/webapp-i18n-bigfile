This repository holds files that are necessary to do translations in
production, particularly those created/updated by the
update-translations job at http://jenkins.khanacademy.org:

1) The .po files downloaded from crowdin via deploy/download_i18n.py.

2) The videos_*.json files holding information about youtube videos we
have that are dubbed into other languages, as downloaded via
tools/import_translations.py.

3) Maybe other stuff.

Files that are only needed internally by the scripts that upload and
download data from crowdin -- including the all.pot we upload to
crowdin and the all.zip we get back from it -- are not in this repository,
but instead are in
   git clone ssh://khanacademy@khanacademy.kilnhg.com/Website/translations/webapp

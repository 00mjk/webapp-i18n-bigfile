"<p>Let's see how to think about binary search on a sorted array.  Yes,\n"
"JavaScript already provides methods for determining whether a\n"
"given element is in an array and, if it is, its location (as do many\n"
"programming languages), but we want to implement it ourselves, to\n"
"understand how you can implement such methods.  Here's a JavaScript\n"
"array of the first 25 prime numbers, in order:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre><code>var primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97];</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Suppose we want to know whether the number 67 is prime. If 67 is in the array, then it's prime.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We might also want to know how many primes are smaller than 67. If we find the position of the number 67 in the array, we can use that to figure out how many smaller primes exist. </p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The position of an element in an array is known as its index. Array indices start at 0 and count upwards. If an element is at index 0 then it is the first element in the array. If an element is at index 3, then it has 3 elements which come before it in the array.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Looking at the example below, we can read the array of prime numbers from left to right, one at a time, until we find the number 67 (in the pink box) and see that it is at array index 18. Looking through the numbers in order like this is a <em>linear search</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Once we know that the prime number 67 is at index 18, we can identify that it is a prime. We can also quickly identify that there are 18 elements which come before 67 in the array, meaning that there are 18 prime numbers smaller than 67.</p>\n"

"before, we start by letting <code>min</code> = 0 and <code>max</code>\n"
"= 24. The first guess in the binary search would therefore be at index\n"
"12 (which is (0 + 24) / 2).  Is <code>primes[12]</code> equal to 67?\n"

"<h1>What is Hour of Code on Khan Academy?</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This year Khan Academy is doing even more to create meaningful hours of codes for all learners (and, as always with KA, for free)!</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On Khan Academy, we offer a&nbsp;multi-hour, self-paced curriculum&nbsp;in JavaScript and lessons in HTML / CSS as well as SQL (language for databases)&nbsp;for students to learn various forms of programming. For Hour of Code, we&#39;ve&nbsp;<span>created special introductory curricula to get your students started!</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This year&nbsp;pick from&nbsp;or have your students pick from:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong><a href=\"/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-code-tutorial/v/welcome-hour-of-code\">Hour of Drawing with Code</a>: </strong>This hour teaches your students to program using JavaScript, one of the world&#39;s most popular programming languages. They&#39;ll use JavaScript to&nbsp;<img alt=\"Hour of Drawing with Code\" src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/images/hour_of_code/js.png\" style=\"float:right; height:150px; width:150px\" />program drawings, finishing with a fun draw-a-wild-animal&nbsp;project. This tutorial requires good typing skills and a keyboard. <em>Recommended ages: 10+.</em></li>\n"
"\t<li><strong><a href=\"/r/hour-of-code-blocks\">Hour of Drawing with Code Blocks</a>:</strong> This is a variant on the first tutorial, but students get to drag and drop blocks of JavaScript code instead of type. Recommended for younger students and students on tablets. This is our first year offering this, so we&#39;d love to hear how students like it. Please have students fill out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/forms/d/1rp-EViRY7UIRe-qJ0CK9xoZmMO58KaIMO8Q9VTomcEs/viewform\">the post-hour survey</a>&nbsp;and email us at compsci-feedback@khanacademy.org with any other feedback.&nbsp;<em>Recommended ages: 8+.</em></li>\n"

"\t<li><strong><a href=\"/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-sql/v/welcome-to-sql\">Hour of Databases</a>: </strong>This hour teaches the fundamentals of databases, which are&nbsp;how apps store data about users and content. <img alt=\"Hour of Databases\" src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/images/hour_of_code/sql.png\" style=\"float:right; height:150px; width:150px\" /> Your students will use SQL to create tables, insert data into them, and do basic querying, finishing with a project to create a database for an imaginary store. Your students&nbsp;need&nbsp;good typing skiils and a keyboard to program in SQL. <em>Recommended ages: 12+.</em></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each option includes the following content:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Videos and &ldquo;talk-throughs&rdquo;, which are how we teach programming concepts.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Coding challenges, which give the student a chance to practice the concept and give us a way to automatically grade them and award points.</li>\n"
"\t<li>A final project, a way for students to use what they&rsquo;ve learned in a more creative, free-form way.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>We believe that it will take students about an hour to get through any one of the&nbsp;options. However, we also believe on Khan Academy that students should be able to learn at their own pace, so we encourage you to give students more than an hour (like 1.5-2 hours), or make it clear that they don&rsquo;t need to finish the entire lesson.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>What is Hour of Code?</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Hour of Code is an initiative to get students to spend an hour of time learning to program, as part of national <a href=\"http://hourofcode.com/khanacademy\">CS Education Week&nbsp;(December 8-14, 2014)</a>. Hopefully, after spending just one hour coding, students will want to keep going with many more hours of code.</p>\n"

"<p><strong><span>Is the curriculum translated into different languages?</span></strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Translators are currently localizing full&nbsp;curricula into <a href=\"https://es.khanacademy.org/hourofcode\">Spanish</a>, <a href=\"https://pt.khanacademy.org/hourofcode\">Portuguese</a>, and <a href=\"https://fr.khanacademy.org/hourofcode\">French</a>.

While the code itself won&#39;t&nbsp;be translated, the fully interactive platform and all&nbsp;relevant articles, challenges and projects will be localized for audiences around the world.

"<p>Yes, there is a&nbsp;transcript option available for the talk-throughs. Click the gear menu next to the play bar and select &quot;Interactive Transcript.&quot; Students can pause the talk-through&nbsp;if it is going too quickly.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Do the tutorials&nbsp;work on an iPad?​</strong></p>\n"

"<p>The code editor does not work very well on an iPad, so we have developed a&nbsp;block-based input mechanism for the Hour of Drawing with Code, <a href=\"/r/hour-of-code-blocks\">which your students can visit here</a>. We recommend this option for iPad users.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Do the tutorials&nbsp;work on ChromeBooks?</strong></p>\n"

"<p><strong>Can students continue working on Hour of Code after the class?</strong></p>\n"

"<p><strong><span>Is the curriculum translated into different languages?</span></strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Translators are currently localizing full&nbsp;curricula into <a href=\"https://es.khanacademy.org/hourofcode\">Spanish</a>, <a href=\"https://pt.khanacademy.org/hourofcode\">Portuguese</a>, and <a href=\"https://fr.khanacademy.org/hourofcode\">French</a>.

While the code itself won&#39;t&nbsp;be translated, the fully interactive platform and all&nbsp;relevant articles, challenges and projects will be localized for audiences around the world. Interactive transcripts in these languages will also be available so learners can go at their own pace,&nbsp;in their own language.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The International Team aims to make&nbsp;the full platform&nbsp;experience&nbsp;available in languages across the world.

"\n"
"<p><strong>Is the curriculum accessible to deaf students?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Yes, there is a&nbsp;transcript option available for the talk-throughs. Click the gear menu next to the play bar and select &quot;Interactive Transcript.&quot; Students can pause the talk-through&nbsp;if it is going too quickly.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Do the tutorials&nbsp;work on an iPad?​</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The code editor does not work very well on an iPad, so we have developed a&nbsp;block-based input mechanism instead for the Hour of Drawing with Code, which <a href=\"/r/hour-of-code-blocks\">your students can visit here</a>. We recommend this option for iPad users.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Do the tutorials&nbsp;work on ChromeBooks?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>ChromeBooks use the Google Chrome browser, which is one of Khan Academy&#39;s supported browsers, so yes, all of the tutorials should work well on a ChromeBook.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Can students continue working on the lesson after Hour of Code?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Yes! They can work on it at their own pace at any time. They should sign up for an account (or use an account you&#39;ve created for them)&nbsp;if they want to easily pick up later from where they left off.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Do students need a Khan&nbsp;Academy account to use the curriculum?</strong></p>\n"

"<p><span>This year Khan Academy is doing even more to create meaningful hours of codes for all learners (and, as always with KA, for free)!</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On Khan Academy, we offer a&nbsp;multi-hour, self-paced curriculum&nbsp;in JavaScript and lessons in HTML / CSS as well as SQL (language for databases)&nbsp;for your child to learn various forms of programming. For Hour of Code, we&#39;ve&nbsp;<span>created special introductory curricula to get your child started!</span></p>\n"

They&#39;ll use JavaScript to&nbsp;<img alt=\"コードで絵を描く時間\" src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/images/hour_of_code/js.png\" style=\"float:right; height:150px; width:150px\" />program drawings, finishing with a fun draw-a-wild-animal&nbsp;project. This tutorial requires good typing skills and a keyboard. <em>Recommended ages: 10+.</em></li>\n"
"\t<li><strong><a href=\"/r/hour-of-code-blocks\">Hour of Drawing with Code Blocks</a>:</strong> This is a variant on the first tutorial, but students get to drag and drop blocks of JavaScript code instead of type. Recommended for younger students and students on tablets.&nbsp;This is our first year offering this, so we&#39;d love to hear how students like it. Please have students fill out&nbsp;the post-hour survey&nbsp;and email us at compsci-feedback@khanacademy.org with any other feedback.&nbsp;<em>Recommended ages: 8+.</em></li>\n"

"<p><span>We believe that it will take your child about an hour to get through any one of the&nbsp;options.

"<p>Observe the figure below. If we want to calculate <strong>12+9 mod 7</strong> we can easily go around the modular circle for a sequence of <strong>12+9 steps</strong> clockwise (as shown in the bottom left circle).</p>\n"
"<p><img alt=\"mod\" src=\"http://britcruise.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/cryptomath_12plus9mod7.jpg?w=393\" /></p>\n"
"<p>We can take a shortcut by observing that every <strong>7 steps</strong> we end up in the same position on the modular circle. These complete loops around the modular circle <strong>don’t contribute to our final position</strong>. We ignore these complete loops around the circle by <strong>calculating each number mod 7</strong> (as shown in the two upper modular circles). This will give us the number of clockwise steps, relative to 0, that contributed to each of their final positions around the modular circle.  </p>\n"
"<p>Now, we only have to go around the circle clockwise the total of the number of steps that contributed to each of numbers final position (as shown in the bottom right modular circle). <strong>This method applies, in general, to any two integers and any modular circle.</strong></p>\n"
"<h2>Proof for Modular Addition</h2>\n"
"<p>We will prove that <strong>(A + B) mod C = (A mod C + B mod C) mod C</strong><br />\n"
"We must show that <strong>LHS=RHS</strong></p>\n"
"<p>From the <a href=\"/math/applied-math/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-quotient-remainder-theorem\">quotient remainder theorem</a> we can write A and B as:  </p>\n"
"<p><strong>A</strong> = C * Q1 + R1 where 0 ≤ R1 &lt; C and Q1 is some integer. <strong>A mod C = R1</strong><br />\n"
"<strong>B</strong> = C * Q2 + R2 where 0 ≤ R2 &lt; C and Q2 is some integer. <strong>B mod C = R2</strong><br />\n"
"<strong>(A + B) = C * (Q1 + Q2) + R1+R2</strong> </p>\n"
"<p><strong>LHS</strong> = (A + B) mod C<br />\n"
"<strong>LHS</strong> = (C * (Q1 + Q2) + R1+ R2) mod C<br />\n"
"We can eliminate the multiples of C when we take the mod C<br />\n"
"<strong>LHS = (R1 + R2) mod C</strong></p>\n"
"<p><strong>RHS</strong> = (A mod C + B mod C) mod C<br />\n"
"<strong>RHS = (R1 + R2) mod C</strong></p>\n"

"<h2>Intuition Behind Modular Addition</h2>\n"
"<p>Observe the figure below. If we want to calculate <strong>12+9 mod 7</strong> we can easily go around the modular circle for a sequence of <strong>12+9 steps</strong> clockwise (as shown in the bottom left circle).</p>\n"
"<p><img alt=\"mod\" src=\"http://britcruise.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/cryptomath_12plus9mod7.jpg?w=393\" /></p>\n"
"<p>We can take a shortcut by observing that every <strong>7 steps</strong> we end up in the same position on the modular circle. These complete loops around the modular circle <strong>don’t contribute to our final position</strong>. We ignore these complete loops around the circle by <strong>calculating each number mod 7</strong> (as shown in the two upper modular circles). This will give us the number of clockwise steps, relative to 0, that contributed to each of their final positions around the modular circle.  </p>\n"
"<p>Now, we only have to go around the circle clockwise the total of the number of steps that contributed to each of numbers final position (as shown in the bottom right modular circle). <strong>This method applies, in general, to any two integers and any modular circle.</strong></p>\n"
"<h2>Proof for Modular Addition</h2>\n"
"<p>We will prove that <strong>(A + B) mod C = (A mod C + B mod C) mod C</strong><br />\n"
"We must show that <strong>LHS=RHS</strong></p>\n"
"<p>From the <a href=\"/math/applied-math/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-quotient-remainder-theorem\">quotient remainder theorem</a> we can write A and B as:  </p>\n"
"<p><strong>A</strong> = C * Q1 + R1 where 0 ≤ R1 &lt; C and Q1 is some integer. <strong>A mod C = R1</strong><br />\n"
"<strong>B</strong> = C * Q2 + R2 where 0 ≤ R2 &lt; C and Q2 is some integer. <strong>B mod C = R2</strong><br />\n"
"<strong>(A + B) = C * (Q1 + Q2) + R1+R2</strong> </p>\n"
"<p><strong>LHS</strong> = (A + B) mod C<br />\n"
"<strong>LHS</strong> = (C * (Q1 + Q2) + R1+ R2) mod C<br />\n"
"We can eliminate the multiples of C when we take the mod C<br />\n"
"<strong>LHS = (R1 + R2) mod C</strong></p>\n"
"<p><strong>RHS</strong> = (A mod C + B mod C) mod C<br />\n"
"<strong>RHS = (R1 + R2) mod C</strong></p>\n"
"<p><strong>LHS=RHS=  (R1 + R2) mod C</strong></p>\n"

"<h3>The Abode of Islam</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the life of Ibn Battuta (sometimes spelled Battutah), Islamic civilization stretched from the Atlantic coast of West Africa across northern Africa, the Middle East, and India to Southeast Asia. This constituted the <em>Dar al-Islam</em>, or &ldquo;Abode of Islam.&rdquo; In addition, there were important communities&nbsp;<span>of Muslims in cities and towns beyond the frontiers of Dar al-Islam. People in the whole &ldquo;umma,&rdquo; or community of people believing in one god and his sacred law (&ldquo;shari&rsquo;a&rdquo;), shared doctrinal beliefs, religious rituals, moral values, and everyday manners. In the early 1300s this community was expanding dramatically.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Background</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta was born in Tangier, part of modern-day Morocco, on February 25, 1304. This port city on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean lies 45 miles west of the Mediterranean Sea, close to the western side of the Strait of Gibraltar &mdash; where Africa and Europe nearly collide.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The men in Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s family were legal scholars and he was raised with a focus on education; however, there was no &ldquo;madrasa,&rdquo; or college of higher learning, in Tangier. Thus, Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s urge to travel was spurred by interest in finding the best teachers and the best libraries, which were then in Alexandria, Cairo, and Damascus. He also wanted to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, called the &ldquo;hajj,&rdquo; as soon as possible, out of eagerness and devotion to his faith.</p>\n"

Unlike the young Marco Polo,&nbsp;<span>he was quite alone, as illustrated by this passage from <em>The Travels of Ibn Battuta</em>, his detailed account of his wanderings:</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveler in whose companionship I might find cheer, nor caravan whose party I might join, but swayed&nbsp;<span>by an overmastering impulse within me and a desire long-cherished in my bosom to visit these illustrious sanctuaries. So I braced my resolution to quit all my dear ones, female and male, and forsook my home as birds forsake their nests. My parents being yet in the bonds of life, it weighed sorely upon me to part from them, and both they and I were afflicted with sorrow at this separation.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&mdash; from The Travels of Ibn Battutah</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Travels</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s solitude did not last long, according to his chronicles. The governor of one city gave him alms of gold and woolen cloth, as almsgiving was considered a pillar of Islam. Ibn Battuta stayed at madrasas and at Sufi hospices as he made his way to Tunis. By the time he left Tunis he was serving as a paid judge, a <em>qadi</em>, of a caravan of pilgrims who needed their disputes settled by a well-educated man. Alexandria and Damascus were two highlights on the part of the trip that followed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta entered Mecca in mid-October 1326, a year and four months after leaving home. He stayed a month, taking part in all the ritual experiences and talking with diverse people from every Islamic land. While his writings don&rsquo;t provide much detail about what this experience meant to him, after it was over he set out for Baghdad instead of returning home. He traveled in a camel caravan of returning pilgrims, and this is when his real globetrotting began.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta led a complete life while traveling. He studied and prayed;&nbsp;<span>he practiced his legal profession; he had astonishing outdoor adventures; he married at least 10 times and left children growing up all over Afro-Eurasia. A few examples of these activities provide a good picture of his life&rsquo;s journey.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Alexandria, Ibn Battuta spent three days as a guest of a locally venerated Sufi ascetic by the name of Burhan al-Din the Lame. This holy man saw that Ibn Battuta had a passion for travel. He suggested that Ibn Battuta visit three other fellow Sufis, two in India and one in China. Of the encounter with&nbsp;<span>Buurhan al-Din, Ibn Battuta wrote in his <em>Travels</em>, &ldquo;I was amazed at his [Burhan al-Din&rsquo;s] prediction, and the idea of going to these countries having been cast into my mind, my wanderings never ceased until I had met these three that he named and conveyed his greeting to them.&rdquo;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta visited another saint who lived a quiet life of devotion in a town near Alexandria. It was summer and Ibn Battuta slept on the roof of the man&rsquo;s cell. There he had a dream of a large bird that carried him far eastward and left him there. The saint interpreted this to mean that Ibn Battuta would travel to India and stay there for a long time, echoing what Burhan al-Din had said.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta then fulfilled the prophesies of the various seers he&rsquo;d met by traveling to India via Afghanistan, where he had to cross the Hindu Kush Mountains at one of several high passes. His group crossed at the 13,000-foot (4,000-meter) Khawak Pass. &ldquo;We crossed the mountains,&rdquo; Ibn Battuta re-called in <em>Travels</em>, &ldquo;setting out about the end of the night and traveling all day long until sunset. We kept spreading felt clothes in front of the camels for them to tread on, so that they would not sink in the snow.&rdquo; Upon arriving in Delhi, Ibn Battuta sought an official career from the Muslim king of India, Muhammad Tughluq.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The king of India made a practice of appointing foreigners as ministers&nbsp;<span>and judges. As Ibn Battuta traveled to the court in Delhi, 82 Hindu bandits attacked his group of 22; Ibn Battuta and his men drove them off, killing&nbsp;</span><span>13 of the thieves. King Tughluq appointed him judge of Delhi, but since Ibn Battuta did not speak Persian, the language of the court, two scholars were appointed to do the work of hearing cases. After eight years, Ibn Battuta was eager to escape the political intrigue. The king agreed to send him as an ambassador to China, and made him responsible for taking shiploads of&nbsp;</span><span>goods to the Yuan emperor, in return for the emperor&rsquo;s previous gifts of 100 slaves and cartloads of cloth and swords.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta was set to sail from Calcutta with one large ship holding the goods for the Chinese emperor and a smaller ship filled with his personal entourage. Everything and everybody was loaded for departure, but Ibn Battuta spent the last day in the city attending Friday prayers. That evening a storm blew in, and the large ship with the presents ran aground and sank.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The smaller one, with Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s servants, concubines, friends, and personal belongings, took to sea to escape the storm. Reduced to his prayer rug and the clothes on his back, Ibn Battuta could only hope to catch up with the ship carrying his group.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Thus Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s travels continued, with narrow escapes and dramatically varying fortunes. Eventually he learned that his ship had been seized by a non-Muslim ruler in Sumatra. He decided to go to China anyway, but stopped on the way at the Maldives, an island group 400 miles southwest off the coast of India.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Maldives, Ibn Battuta enjoyed the company of women even more than usual. Usually, he married one at a time and divorced her when he left on further travels. He often had concubines, too, purchased or given as gifts. In the Maldives he married four women on one island, the legal limit under Muslim law. As he wrote in his <em>Travels</em>:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>It is easy to marry in these islands because of the smallness of the dowries and the pleasures of society which the women offer... When the ships put in, the crew marry; when they intend to leave they divorce their wives. This is a kind of temporary marriage. The women of these islands never leave their country.</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From there, Ibn Battuta continued on to China. Battuta&rsquo;s narrative about China occupies less than 6 percent of his whole story. It is so sketchy and confusing that some scholars doubt that he even went to China and believe he merely fabricated this part of his account.

"<p>China was beautiful, but it did not please me. On the contrary, I was greatly troubled thinking about the way paganism dominated this country. Whenever I went out of my lodging, I saw many blameworthy things. That disturbed me so much that I stayed indoors most of&nbsp;<span>the time and only went out when necessary.

"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta returned home in 1349 to Tangier, where he visited the grave of his mother, who had been carried off by the Black Death (plague) only a few months before his return. (During his return, he learned in Damascus that his father had died 15 years earlier.) Ibn Battuta stayed in Tangier only a few days before leaving to visit North Africa, Spain, and West Africa (Mali).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>He returned from that trip in 1354 to Fez, Morocco, where the local sultan commissioned a young literary scholar to record Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s experiences. The scholar had to compose the whole story into literary form, using a type of Arabic literature called a <em>rihla</em>, indicating a journey in search of divine knowledge. The two men collaborated for two years, with Ibn Battuta telling his story and drafting notes about it. Ibn Battuta possessed an extraordinary memory, but he also misremembered some facts and dates.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>All we know about Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s life after the writing of his book is that he held the office of judge in some town or other. Since he was not yet 50 when he stopped traveling, he is thought to have married again and to have had more children. He died in 1368 or 1369; the place of his death is not known, nor the location of his grave.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The legacy of Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s <em>Travels</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Unlike the impact of the <em>Travels of Marco Polo</em> on the European world, the account of Battuta&rsquo;s travels had only modest impact on the Muslim world before the 19th century. While copies circulated earlier, it was French&nbsp;<span>and English scholars who eventually brought </span><em>The Travels of Ibn Battuta</em><span> the international attention it deserved.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How does Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s account compare with that of Marco Polo&rsquo;s? Each traveler lived by his wits &mdash; they had that in common. Each took joy in dis- covering new experiences, and each exercised amazing perseverance and fortitude to complete extensive travels and return to their home country.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Yet there were many differences. Ibn Battuta was an educated, cosmopolitan, gregarious, upper-class man who traveled within a familiar Muslim culture, meeting like-minded people wherever he went. Polo was a merchant, not formally educated, who traveled to strange, unfamiliar cultures, where he learned new ways of dressing, speaking, and behaving. Ibn Battuta told more about himself, the people he met, and the importance of the positions he held. Marco Polo, on the other had, focused on reporting accurate information about what he had observed. How fortunate we are to have accounts from two contrasting intercontinental travelers from more than 600 years ago.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta returned home in 1349 to Tangier, where he visited the grave of his mother, who had been carried off by the Black Death (plague) only a few months before his return. (During his return, he learned in Damascus that his father had died 15 years earlier.) Ibn Battuta stayed in Tangier only a few days before leaving to visit North Africa, Spain, and West Africa (Mali).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>He returned from that trip in 1354 to Fez, Morocco, where the local sultan commissioned a young literary scholar to record Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s experiences. The scholar had to compose the whole story into literary form, using a type of Arabic literature called a <em>rihla</em>, indicating a journey in search of divine knowledge. The two men collaborated for two years, with Ibn Battuta telling his story and drafting notes about it. Ibn Battuta possessed an extraordinary memory, but he also misremembered some facts and dates.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>All we know about Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s life after the writing of his book is that he held the office of judge in some town or other. Since he was not yet 50 when he stopped traveling, he is thought to have married again and to have had more children. He died in 1368 or 1369; the place of his death is not known, nor the location of his grave.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The legacy of Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s <em>Travels</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Unlike the impact of the <em>Travels of Marco Polo</em> on the European world, the account of Battuta&rsquo;s travels had only modest impact on the Muslim world before the 19th century. While copies circulated earlier, it was French&nbsp;<span>and English scholars who eventually brought </span><em>The Travels of Ibn Battuta</em><span> the international attention it deserved.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How does Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s account compare with that of Marco Polo&rsquo;s? Each traveler lived by his wits &mdash; they had that in common. Each took joy in dis- covering new experiences, and each exercised amazing perseverance and fortitude to complete extensive travels and return to their home country.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Yet there were many differences. Ibn Battuta was an educated, cosmopolitan, gregarious, upper-class man who traveled within a familiar Muslim culture, meeting like-minded people wherever he went. Polo was a merchant, not formally educated, who traveled to strange, unfamiliar cultures, where he learned new ways of dressing, speaking, and behaving. Ibn Battuta told more about himself, the people he met, and the importance of the positions he held. Marco Polo, on the other had, focused on reporting accurate information about what he had observed. How fortunate we are to have accounts from two contrasting intercontinental travelers from more than 600 years ago.</p>\n"

"<h3>Rock art and the origins of art in Africa</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The oldest scientifically-dated rock art in Africa dates from around 26,000-28,000 years ago and is found in Namibia.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Between 1969 and 1972, German archaeologist, W.E. Wendt, researching in an area known locally as &quot;Goachanas,&quot; unearthed several painted slabs in a cave he named Apollo 11, after NASA&rsquo;s successful moon landing mission.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Seven painted stone slabs of brown-grey quartzite, depicting a variety of animals painted in charcoal, ochre and white, were located in a Middle Stone Age deposit&nbsp;(100,000&ndash;60,000 years ago). These images are not easily identifiable to species level, but have been interpreted variously as felines and/or bovids; one in particular has been observed to be either a zebra, giraffe or ostrich, demonstrating the ambiguous nature of the depictions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Art and our modern mind</h3>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>The sarcophagus depicts a reclining man and woman on its lid. The pair rests on highly stylized cushions, just as they would have done at an actual banquet. The body of the sarcophagus is styled so as to resemble a&nbsp;kline&nbsp;(dining couch).&nbsp;Both figures have highly stylized hair, in each case plaited with the stylized braids hanging rather stiffly at the sides of the neck. In the female&rsquo;s case the plaits are arranged so as to hang down in front of each shoulder. The female wears a soft cap atop her head; she also wears shoes with pointed toes that are characteristically Etruscan. The male&rsquo;s braids hang neatly at the back, splayed across the upper back and shoulders. The male&rsquo;s beard and the hair atop his head is quite abstracted without any interior detail. Both figures have elongated proportions that are at home in the archaic period in the Mediterranean.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>A banquet</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The S<em>arcophagus of the Spouses</em> has been interpreted as belonging to a banqueting scene, with the couple reclining together on a single dining couch while eating and drinking. This situates the inspiration for the sarcophagus squarely in the convivial (social)&nbsp;sphere and, as we are often reminded, conviviality was central to Etruscan mortuary rituals. Etruscan funerary art&mdash;including painted tombs&mdash;often depicts scenes of revelry, perhaps as a reminder of the funeral banquet that would send the deceased off to the afterlife or perhaps to reflect the notion of perpetual conviviality in said afterlife. Whatever the case, banquets provide a great deal of iconographic fodder for Etruscan artists.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8d85b67cbd8faf6e4924ec70ef3b7e91998b90c1.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Banquet Plaque</em> (detail)&nbsp;from Poggio Civitate, early 6th century B.C.E., Etruscan, terracotta (Antiquarium di Poggio Civitate Museo Archeologico, Murlo, Italy) (photo:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lastra_di_rivestimento_fittile_con_scena_di_banchetto,_murlo,_antiquarium_di_poggio_civitate,_VI_sec._ac..JPG\">sailko</a>,&nbsp;CC BY-SA 3.0)</span></span>In the case of the sarcophagus it is also important to note that at Etruscan banquets, men and women reclined and ate together, a circumstance that was quite different from other Mediterranean cultures, especially the Greeks. We see multiple instances of mixed gender banquets across a wide chronological range, leading us to conclude that this was common practice in Etruria. The terracotta plaque from Poggio Civitate,&nbsp;Murlo (above), for instance, that is roughly contemporary to the sarcophagus of the spouses shows a close iconographic parallel for this custom. This cultural custom generated some resentment&mdash;even animus&mdash;on the part of Greek and Latin authors in antiquity who saw this Etruscan practice not just as different, but took it as offensive behavior. Women enjoyed a different and more privileged status in Etruscan society than did their Greek and Roman counterparts.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Technical achievement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <em>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</em> is a masterwork of terracotta sculpture. Painted terracotta sculpture played a key role in the visual culture of archaic Etruria. Terracotta artwork was the standard for decorating the superstructure of Etruscan temples and the coroplastic (terracotta) workshops producing these sculptures often displayed a high level of technical achievement. This is due, in part, to the fact that ready sources of marble were unknown in archaic Italy. Even though contemporary Greeks produced masterworks in marble during the sixth century B.C.E., terracotta statuary such as this sarcophagus itself counts as a masterwork and would have been an elite commission. Contemporary Greek colonists in Italy also produced high level terracotta statuary, as exemplified by the seated statue of Zeus from Poseidonia (later renamed Paestum) that dates c. 530 B.C.E. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Etruscan culture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the case of the Caeretan sarcophagus, it is an especially challenging commission. Given its size, it would have been fired in multiple pieces. The composition of the reclining figures shows awareness of Mediterranean stylistic norms in that their physiognomy reflects an Ionian&nbsp;influence (Ionia was a region in present-day Turkey, that was a Greek colony)&mdash;the rounded, serene faces and the treatment of hairstyles would have fit in with contemporary Greek styles. However, the posing of the figures, the angular joints of the limbs, and their extended fingers and toes reflect local practice in Etruria. In short, the artist and his workshop are aware of global trends while also catering to a local audience. While we cannot identify the original owner of the sarcophagus, it is clear that the person(s) commissioning it would have been a member of the Caeretan elite.</p>\n"

"(Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia in Rome)</span></span>The <em>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</em> as an object conveys a great deal of information about Etruscan culture and its customs. The convivial theme of the sarcophagus reflects the funeral customs of Etruscan society and the elite nature of the object itself provides important information about the ways in which funerary custom could reinforce the identity and standing of aristocrats among the community of the living.</p>\n"

"<h3>An archaic couple</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The sarcophagus depicts a reclining man and woman on its lid. The pair rests on highly stylized cushions, just as they would have done at an actual banquet. The body of the sarcophagus is styled so as to resemble a&nbsp;kline&nbsp;(dining couch).&nbsp;Both figures have highly stylized hair, in each case plaited with the stylized braids hanging rather stiffly at the sides of the neck. In the female&rsquo;s case the plaits are arranged so as to hang down in front of each shoulder. The female wears a soft cap atop her head; she also wears shoes with pointed toes that are characteristically Etruscan. The male&rsquo;s braids hang neatly at the back, splayed across the upper back and shoulders. The male&rsquo;s beard and the hair atop his head is quite abstracted without any interior detail. Both figures have elongated proportions that are at home in the archaic period in the Mediterranean.</p>\n"

"<h3>A banquet</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The S<em>arcophagus of the Spouses</em> has been interpreted as belonging to a banqueting scene, with the couple reclining together on a single dining couch while eating and drinking. This situates the inspiration for the sarcophagus squarely in the convivial (social)&nbsp;sphere and, as we are often reminded, conviviality was central to Etruscan mortuary rituals. Etruscan funerary art&mdash;including painted tombs&mdash;often depicts scenes of revelry, perhaps as a reminder of the funeral banquet that would send the deceased off to the afterlife or perhaps to reflect the notion of perpetual conviviality in said afterlife. Whatever the case, banquets provide a great deal of iconographic fodder for Etruscan artists.</p>\n"

We see multiple instances of mixed gender banquets across a wide chronological range, leading us to conclude that this was common practice in Etruria. The terracotta plaque from Poggio Civitate,&nbsp;Murlo (above), for instance, that is roughly contemporary to the sarcophagus of the spouses shows a close iconographic parallel for this custom. This cultural custom generated some resentment&mdash;even animus&mdash;on the part of Greek and Latin authors in antiquity who saw this Etruscan practice not just as different, but took it as offensive behavior. Women enjoyed a different and more privileged status in Etruscan society than did their Greek and Roman counterparts.</p>\n"

"<h3>Technical achievement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <em>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</em> is a masterwork of terracotta sculpture. Painted terracotta sculpture played a key role in the visual culture of archaic Etruria. Terracotta artwork was the standard for decorating the superstructure of Etruscan temples and the coroplastic (terracotta) workshops producing these sculptures often displayed a high level of technical achievement. This is due, in part, to the fact that ready sources of marble were unknown in archaic Italy. Even though contemporary Greeks produced masterworks in marble during the sixth century B.C.E., terracotta statuary such as this sarcophagus itself counts as a masterwork and would have been an elite commission. Contemporary Greek colonists in Italy also produced high level terracotta statuary, as exemplified by the seated statue of Zeus from Poseidonia (later renamed Paestum) that dates c. 530 B.C.E. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Etruscan culture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the case of the Caeretan sarcophagus, it is an especially challenging commission. Given its size, it would have been fired in multiple pieces. The composition of the reclining figures shows awareness of Mediterranean stylistic norms in that their physiognomy reflects an Ionian&nbsp;influence (Ionia was a region in present-day Turkey, that was a Greek colony)&mdash;the rounded, serene faces and the treatment of hairstyles would have fit in with contemporary Greek styles. However, the posing of the figures, the angular joints of the limbs, and their extended fingers and toes reflect local practice in Etruria. In short, the artist and his workshop are aware of global trends while also catering to a local audience. While we cannot identify the original owner of the sarcophagus, it is clear that the person(s) commissioning it would have been a member of the Caeretan elite.</p>\n"

"(Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia in Rome)</span></span>The <em>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</em> as an object conveys a great deal of information about Etruscan culture and its customs. The convivial theme of the sarcophagus reflects the funeral customs of Etruscan society and the elite nature of the object itself provides important information about the ways in which funerary custom could reinforce the identity and standing of aristocrats among the community of the living.</p>\n"

"<h3>Forests of Stone</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Algeria is Africa&rsquo;s largest country and most of it falls within the Sahara Desert. It also hosts a rich rock art concentration. Most of the sites are found in the south east of the country near its borders with Libya and Niger but there are also important concentrations in the Algerian Maghreb and in the Hoggar Mountains in the central south.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most renowned of all these areas is the Tassili n&rsquo;Ajjer (meaning &quot;plateau of chasms&quot;) in the south east. Water and sand erosion have carved out a landscape of thin passageways, large arches, and high-pillared rocks, described as &ldquo;forests of stone&rdquo; by French archaeologist and ethnographer Henri Lhote. The resulting undercuts at cliff bases have created rock shelters with smooth walls ideal for painting and engraving (left).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Ajjer plateau rises to approximately 500-600 meters above the plain of Djanet, an oasis city, and capital of Djanet District, in Illizi Province, southeast Algeria. The region has been inhabited since Neolithic times, when the environment was much wetter and sustained a wider extent of flora and fauna as witnessed in the numerous rock paintings of Tassili n&#39;Ajjer. Classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982 and Biosphere Reserve in 1986, Tassili n&#39;Ajjer covers a vast area of desert landscape in southern Algeria, stretching from the Niger and Libyan border area, north and east of Djanet, as far as Illizi and Amguid, covering an area of 72,000 sq. km.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It seems strange now but for a while the art world turned its back on the German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Aside from being cursed with the label of Hitler&rsquo;s favourite artist, for much of the twentieth century the Impressionists, with their loose, painterly style, were held to be the fathers of modern art. Friedrich&rsquo;s work in comparison was considered too meticulous, too precise, too finely detailed to warrant serious critical attention.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Over the last few decades though the tide of opinion has turned. Now it is generally accepted that both in his technical brilliance and theoretically in his views of what the purpose of art should be, Friedrich was as radical as they come. But if proof were ever needed again of his credentials as one of the great forerunners of modern art, then <em>The Monk by the Sea </em>would have to be it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A new departure</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b6b8750b6d4f3e88d9971b7aadd4c1bd19a86836.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Friedrich, <em>Abbey Among Oak Trees,</em>&nbsp;1809 or 1810, oil on canvas, 110.4 x 171 cm&nbsp;(Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin)</span></span>Exhibited in the Academy in Berlin in 1810 along with its companion piece<em>&nbsp;Abbey Among Oak Trees</em>, it depicts a monk standing on the shore looking out to sea. The location has been identified as R&uuml;gen, an island off the north-east coast of Germany, a site he frequently painted.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monk is positioned a little over a third of the way into the painting from the left, to a ratio of around 1:1.6. The same ratio can be found frequently in Western art and is known variously as the golden ration, rule or section. Aside from this nod to tradition however there is little else about this painting that can be described as conventional.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The horizon line is unusually low and stretches uninterrupted from one end of the canvas to the other. The dark blue sea is flecked with white suggesting the threat of a storm. Above it in that turbulent middle section blue-grey clouds gather giving way in the highest part to a clearer, calmer blue. The transition from one to the other is achieved subtly through a technique called scumbling in which one colour is applied in thin layers on top of another to create an ill-defined, hazy effect.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The composition could not be further from typical German landscape paintings of the time. These generally followed the principles of a style imported from England known as the picturesque which tended to employ well-established perspectival techniques designed to draw the viewer into the picture; devices such as trees situated in the foreground or rivers winding their course, snake- like, into the distance. Friedrich however deliberately shunned such tricks. Such wilfully unconventional decisions in a painting of this size provoked consternation among contemporary viewers, as his friend Heinrich von Kleist famously wrote: &ldquo;Since it has, in its uniformity and boundlessness, no foreground but the frame, it is as if one&rsquo;s eyelids had been cut off.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The monk</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is some debate as to who that strange figure, curved like a question mark, actually is. Some think it Friedrich himself, others the poet and theological Gotthard Ludwig Kosegarten who served as a pastor on R&uuml;gen and was known to give sermons on the shore. Kosegarten&rsquo;s writings certainly influenced the painting. Von Kleist, for example, refers to its &ldquo;Kosegarten effect&rdquo;. &nbsp;According to this pastor-poet nature, like the Bible, is a book through which God reveals Himself. &nbsp;God reveals Himself. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/18bd270942bf569f68c1cd578ea17b7cfccf093c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Monk (detail), Caspar David Friedrich, <em>Monk by the Sea,</em> c. 1809&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Similarly, stripping it of any literal Christian symbolism, Friedrich instead concentrates on the power of the natural climate and so charges the landscape with a divine authority, one which seems to all but subsume the figure of the monk. With nothing but land, sea and sky to measure him by, his physical presence is rendered fragile and hauntingly ambiguous.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The R&uuml;ckenfigur</h3>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It seems strange now but for a while the art world turned its back on the German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Aside from being cursed with the label of Hitler&rsquo;s favourite artist, for much of the twentieth century the Impressionists, with their loose, painterly style, were held to be the fathers of modern art. Friedrich&rsquo;s work in comparison was considered too meticulous, too precise, too finely detailed to warrant serious critical attention.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Over the last few decades though the tide of opinion has turned. Now it is generally accepted that both in his technical brilliance and theoretically in his views of what the purpose of art should be, Friedrich was as radical as they come. But if proof were ever needed again of his credentials as one of the great forerunners of modern art, then <em>The Monk by the Sea </em>would have to be it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A new departure</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b6b8750b6d4f3e88d9971b7aadd4c1bd19a86836.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Friedrich, <em>Abbey Among Oak Trees,</em>&nbsp;1809 or 1810, oil on canvas, 110.4 x 171 cm&nbsp;(Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin)</span></span>Exhibited in the Academy in Berlin in 1810 along with its companion piece<em>&nbsp;Abbey Among Oak Trees</em>, it depicts a monk standing on the shore looking out to sea. The location has been identified as R&uuml;gen, an island off the north-east coast of Germany, a site he frequently painted.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monk is positioned a little over a third of the way into the painting from the left, to a ratio of around 1:1.6. The same ratio can be found frequently in Western art and is known variously as the golden ration, rule or section. Aside from this nod to tradition however there is little else about this painting that can be described as conventional.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The horizon line is unusually low and stretches uninterrupted from one end of the canvas to the other. The dark blue sea is flecked with white suggesting the threat of a storm. Above it in that turbulent middle section blue-grey clouds gather giving way in the highest part to a clearer, calmer blue. The transition from one to the other is achieved subtly through a technique called scumbling in which one colour is applied in thin layers on top of another to create an ill-defined, hazy effect.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The composition could not be further from typical German landscape paintings of the time. These generally followed the principles of a style imported from England known as the picturesque which tended to employ well-established perspectival techniques designed to draw the viewer into the picture; devices such as trees situated in the foreground or rivers winding their course, snake- like, into the distance. Friedrich however deliberately shunned such tricks. Such wilfully unconventional decisions in a painting of this size provoked consternation among contemporary viewers, as his friend Heinrich von Kleist famously wrote: &ldquo;Since it has, in its uniformity and boundlessness, no foreground but the frame, it is as if one&rsquo;s eyelids had been cut off.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The monk</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is some debate as to who that strange figure, curved like a question mark, actually is. Some think it Friedrich himself, others the poet and theological Gotthard Ludwig Kosegarten who served as a pastor on R&uuml;gen and was known to give sermons on the shore. Kosegarten&rsquo;s writings certainly influenced the painting. Von Kleist, for example, refers to its &ldquo;Kosegarten effect&rdquo;. &nbsp;According to this pastor-poet nature, like the Bible, is a book through which God reveals Himself. &nbsp;God reveals Himself. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/18bd270942bf569f68c1cd578ea17b7cfccf093c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Monk (detail), Caspar David Friedrich, <em>Monk by the Sea,</em> c. 1809&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Similarly, stripping it of any literal Christian symbolism, Friedrich instead concentrates on the power of the natural climate and so charges the landscape with a divine authority, one which seems to all but subsume the figure of the monk. With nothing but land, sea and sky to measure him by, his physical presence is rendered fragile and hauntingly ambiguous.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<h3>About carpets</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are among the most fundamental of Islamic arts. Portable, typically made of silk and wools, carpets were traded and sold across the Islamic lands and beyond its boundaries to Europe and China. Those from Iran were highly prized. Carpets decorated the floors of mosques, shrines and homes, but they could also be hung on walls of houses to preserve warmth in the winter.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ardabil and a 14th century Saint</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The carpet takes its name from the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran. Ardabil was the home to the shrine of the Sufi saint, Safi al-Din Ardabili, who died in 1334 (Sufism is Islamic mysticism). He was a Sufi leader who trained his followers in Islamic mystic practices. After his death, his following grew and his descendents became increasingly powerful. In 1501 one of his descendents, Shah Isma&rsquo;il, seized power, united Iran, and established Shi&rsquo;a Islam as the official religion. The dynasty he founded is known as the Safavids. Their rule, which lasted until 1722, was one of the most important periods for Islamic art, especially for textiles and for manuscripts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Made for a shrine&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Plan of the shrine at Ardabil, showing where the carpets were situated (permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4e3d4042f01060ec790cbdbbaa10a10f195823a2.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plan of the shrine at Ardabil, showing where the carpets were situated (permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) </span></span>This carpet was one of a matching pair that was made for the shrine of Safi al-Din Ardabili when it was enlarged in the late 1530s. Today the Ardabil carpet dominates the main Islamic Art Gallery in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, while its twin is in the LA County Museum of Art. The carpets were located side by side in the shrine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The pile of the carpet is made from wool, rather than silk because it holds dye better. The knot-count of a carpet still directly impacts the value of carpets today; the more knots per square centimeter, the more detailed and elaborate the patterns can be. The dyes used to color the carpet are natural&nbsp;and include pomegrante rind and indigo. Up to ten weavers could have worked on the carpet at any given time. The Ardabil carpet has 340 knots per square inch (5300 knots per ten centimeters square). Today, a commercial rug averages 80-160 knots per square inch, meaning that the Ardabil carpet was highly detailed. Its high knot count allowed for the inclusion of an intricate design and pattern. It is not known whether the carpet was produced in a royal workshop, but there is evidence for court workshop in the 15th and 16th centuries. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet, detail\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2328b1ad3ad692f83b5061730c424ddb845b4ead.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Design and Pattern</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The rich geometric patterns, vegetative scrolls, floral flourishes, so typical of Islamic art, reach a fever pitch in this remarkable carpet, encouraging the viewer to walk around and around, trying to absorb every detail of design.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>That the design of the carpet was not arbitrary or piecemeal, but was well-organized and thoughtful can be seen throughout. Considering the immense size of the carpet&mdash;10.51m x 5.34m (34&#39; 6&quot; x 17&#39; 6&quot;)&mdash;this is impressive. A central golden medallion dominates the carpet; it is surrounded by a ring of multi-colored, detailed ovals. Lamps appear to hang at either end.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet (detail)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/349718038689c38ba56ad5b0ae36cc27f683e29d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The carpet&rsquo;s border is made up of a frame with a series of cartouches (rectangular-shaped spaces for calligraphy), filled with decoration. The central medallion design is also echoed by the four corner-pieces.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet (detail of lamp)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13f6ec12fc841d6f40461c05aad2f42286ad972b.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail of lamp)</span></span>Art historians have debated the meaning of the two lamps that appear to hang from the medallion. They are of different sizes and some scholars have proposed that this was done to create a perspective effect, meaning that both lamps appear to be the same size when one sat next to the smaller lamp. Yet, there is no evidence for the use of this type of perspective in Iran in the 1530s, nor does this explain why the lamps were included. Perhaps they were included to mimic lamps found in mosques and shrines, helping the viewer to look deeply into the carpet below them and then above them, to the ceiling where similar lamps would have hung, creating visual unity within the shrine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An inscription&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Ardabil Carpet includes a four-line inscription placed at one end. This short poem is vital for understanding who commissioned the carpet and the date of the carpet.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first three lines of poetry reads:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />\n"
"<span>Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.</span><br />\n"
"<span>The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</span></p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Maqsud was probably the court official charged with producing the carpets. By referring to himself as a slave, he may be presenting himself as a humble servant. The Persian word for a door can be used to denote a shrine or royal court, so this inscription may imply that the royal court patronized the shrine. The carpets would have probably taken four years to make.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The fourth line of the inscription is also important. It provides the date of the carpet, AH 946. The Muslim calendar begins in the year 620 CE when Muhammad fled from Mecca to Medina; this year is known as the year of the Hijra or flight (in Latin anno hegirae). AH 946 is equivalent to 1539/40 CE (the lunar Muslim calendar does not exactly match the Gregorian Calendar, used in the west).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of the Ardabil carpet and its skillful execution is a testament to the great skill of the artisans at work in north-west Iran in the 1530s.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet (detail)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b2279a5996831610b7551aac03c4c1eff80db394.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>How the Carpet Came to the V&amp;A</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many great treasures from around the world have legally made their way into the collections of western museums. Many objects were legally purchased by collectors and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries; however, many works of art are still illegally exported and sold. British visitors to the shrine in 1843, noted that at least one carpet was still in situ. Approximately thirty years or so later, an earthquake damaged the shrine, and the carpets were sold off.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ziegler &amp; Co., a Manchester firm involved in the carpet trade purchased the damaged carpets in Iran and &ldquo;restored&rdquo; them in fashion typical of the late nineteenth century. Selections of one carpet were used to repair the other, resulting in a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; carpet and one lacking a border. Vincent Robinson and Co, a dealer based in London, put the larger carpet up for sale in 1892 and persuaded the V&amp;A to purchase it for &pound;2000 in March 1893.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The second carpet was secretly sold to an American collector, J.P. Getty, who donated it to the LA County Museum of Art in 1953. Unlike the carpet in the V&amp;A, the carpet in LACMA is incomplete. Throughout the twentieth century, other pieces of the carpets have appeared on the art market for sale.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Design and Pattern</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The rich geometric patterns, vegetative scrolls, floral flourishes, so typical of Islamic art, reach a fever pitch in this remarkable carpet, encouraging the viewer to walk around and around, trying to absorb every detail of design.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>That the design of the carpet was not arbitrary or piecemeal, but was well-organized and thoughtful can be seen throughout. Considering the immense size of the carpet&mdash;10.51m x 5.34m (34&#39; 6&quot; x 17&#39; 6&quot;)&mdash;this is impressive. A central golden medallion dominates the carpet; it is surrounded by a ring of multi-colored, detailed ovals. Lamps appear to hang at either end.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet (detail)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/349718038689c38ba56ad5b0ae36cc27f683e29d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The carpet&rsquo;s border is made up of a frame with a series of cartouches (rectangular-shaped spaces for calligraphy), filled with decoration. The central medallion design is also echoed by the four corner-pieces.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet (detail of lamp)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13f6ec12fc841d6f40461c05aad2f42286ad972b.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail of lamp)</span></span>Art historians have debated the meaning of the two lamps that appear to hang from the medallion. They are of different sizes and some scholars have proposed that this was done to create a perspective effect, meaning that both lamps appear to be the same size when one sat next to the smaller lamp. Yet, there is no evidence for the use of this type of perspective in Iran in the 1530s, nor does this explain why the lamps were included. Perhaps they were included to mimic lamps found in mosques and shrines, helping the viewer to look deeply into the carpet below them and then above them, to the ceiling where similar lamps would have hung, creating visual unity within the shrine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An inscription&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Ardabil Carpet includes a four-line inscription placed at one end. This short poem is vital for understanding who commissioned the carpet and the date of the carpet.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first three lines of poetry reads:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />\n"
"<span>Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.</span><br />\n"
"<span>The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</span></p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Maqsud was probably the court official charged with producing the carpets. By referring to himself as a slave, he may be presenting himself as a humble servant. The Persian word for a door can be used to denote a shrine or royal court, so this inscription may imply that the royal court patronized the shrine. The carpets would have probably taken four years to make.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The fourth line of the inscription is also important. It provides the date of the carpet, AH 946. The Muslim calendar begins in the year 620 CE when Muhammad fled from Mecca to Medina; this year is known as the year of the Hijra or flight (in Latin anno hegirae). AH 946 is equivalent to 1539/40 CE (the lunar Muslim calendar does not exactly match the Gregorian Calendar, used in the west).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of the Ardabil carpet and its skillful execution is a testament to the great skill of the artisans at work in north-west Iran in the 1530s.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet (detail)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b2279a5996831610b7551aac03c4c1eff80db394.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>How the Carpet Came to the V&amp;A</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many great treasures from around the world have legally made their way into the collections of western museums. Many objects were legally purchased by collectors and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries; however, many works of art are still illegally exported and sold. British visitors to the shrine in 1843, noted that at least one carpet was still in situ. Approximately thirty years or so later, an earthquake damaged the shrine, and the carpets were sold off.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ziegler &amp; Co., a Manchester firm involved in the carpet trade purchased the damaged carpets in Iran and &ldquo;restored&rdquo; them in fashion typical of the late nineteenth century. Selections of one carpet were used to repair the other, resulting in a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; carpet and one lacking a border. Vincent Robinson and Co, a dealer based in London, put the larger carpet up for sale in 1892 and persuaded the V&amp;A to purchase it for &pound;2000 in March 1893.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The second carpet was secretly sold to an American collector, J.P. Getty, who donated it to the LA County Museum of Art in 1953. Unlike the carpet in the V&amp;A, the carpet in LACMA is incomplete. Throughout the twentieth century, other pieces of the carpets have appeared on the art market for sale.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Dutch Civic Guard&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rembrandt&rsquo;s <em>Night Watch</em> is an example of a very specific type of painting that was exclusive to the Northern Netherlands, with the majority&nbsp;being commissioned in the city of Amsterdam. &nbsp;It is a group portrait of a company of civic guardsmen. The primary purpose of these guardsmen was to serve as defenders of their cities. &nbsp;As such, they were tasked with guarding gates, policing streets, putting out fires, and generally maintaining order throughout the city. &nbsp;Additionally, they were an important presence at parades held for visiting royalty as well and other festive occasions. &nbsp;Each company had its own guild hall as well as a shooting range where they could practice with the specific weapon associated with their group, either a longbow, a crossbow, or a firearm. &nbsp;According to tradition, these assembly halls were decorated with group portraits of its most distinguished members, which served not only to record the likenesses of these citizens, but more importantly to assert the power and individuality of the city that they defended. &nbsp;In short, these images helped promote a sense of pride and civic duty.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Rembrandt was at the height of his career when he received the commission to paint the <em>Night Watch</em> for the <em>Kloveniersdoelen</em>, the guild hall that housed the Amsterdam civic guard company of arquebusiers, or musketeers. &nbsp;This company was under the command of Captain Frans Banning Cocq, who holds a prominent position in the center foreground of the image (above left). He wears the formal black attire and white lace collar of the upper class, accented by a bold red sash across his chest. At his waist is a rapier and in his hand a baton, the latter of which identifies his military rank. Striding forward, he turns his head to the left and emphatically extends his free hand as he addresses his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburgh, who turns to acknowledge his orders. &nbsp;He is also fancifully dressed, but in bright yellow, his military role referenced by the steel gorget he wears around his neck and the strongly foreshortened ceremonial partisan that he carries. &nbsp;Sixteen additional portraits of members of this company are also included, with the names of all inscribed on a framed shield in the archway.&nbsp;As was common practice at the time, sitters paid a fee that was based on their prominence within the painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Next, a rather small figure wearing a helmet adorned with oak leaves fires his weapon to the right. &nbsp;Finally, the man behind the lieutenant clears the pan by blowing off the residual powder (both the figure in a helmet with oak leaves and the man blowing off the powder are visible in the detail of the central figures above).

"<p>Buddhism is a religion based on the teachings of a historical figure known as the&nbsp;Buddha Shakyamuni, who lived about 2,500 years ago. In some schools of Buddhism the Buddha Shakyamuni is thought of as one buddha among many, each inhabiting a different era or part of the universe. This sculpture shows Amitabha, identified as the Buddha of the Western Paradise. Amitabha is shown seated in deep concentration with half-closed eyes and hands held together at the lap in the gesture of meditation. He wears a simple monk&rsquo;s robe, draped over the shoulders, leaving the flesh of his chest and the lower part of one arm exposed. His hair arrangement, typical for Amitabha, is composed of hundreds of curls, and raised at the top in a cranial bulge that is one of the marks of the Buddha&rsquo;s supernatural powers.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, images of Amitabha were created in large numbers as a result of the popularity of a Buddhist sect known as Pure Land. The teachings of this sect emphasized the horrors of Buddhist hells and celebrated the glories of Amitabha&rsquo;s Western Paradise, also known as the&nbsp;Pure Land. Pure Land adherents believed that if they uttered Amitabha&rsquo;s name sincerely, they would achieve salvation, and be escorted to his glorious paradise after death by a retinue of gods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>How was this object made?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Amitabha is carved of wood and constructed using the &ldquo;joined-wood&rdquo; technique. In contrast to earlier wood sculpture carved from a single block, eleventh century sculptors developed this new technique to produce large, lightweight images. Artisans made images like this one by shaping and hollowing separate, smaller blocks of wood, then assembling the parts into one large sculpture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There were several advantages to this technique: the finished sculpture was less likely to split because the wood core had been removed; the use of small pieces of wood required only a third of the wood needed for single-block construction; and the work could be divided into specialized steps each done by different groups of workers, a process somewhat akin to a factory assembly line. After completion, the figure was coated with lacquer and then gilded.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why was this figure important to the samurai?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the&nbsp;Kamakura period&nbsp;(1185&ndash;1333), proselytizing, mendicant monks spread the teachings of Pure Land Buddhism throughout Japan. Along with many commoners, warriors turned to faith in Amitabha as an expedient means of ensuring salvation. Although large-scale images like this one would not have been available on the battlefield, prayer strips inscribed with the name of Amitabha were distributed as portable reminders of his power, allaying the fears of many soldiers in combat. Pure Land monks are known to have attended warriors on the battlefield, encouraging prayer and witnessing the proper conduct of their death.</p>\n"

"<p>Southwell Minster in Nottinghamshire, England, is not as famous as some of Britain&rsquo;s other great medieval churches, and neither is it as large. However, it presents superb examples of both Romanesque or Norman and Gothic architecture in a building that suffered little damage during the turbulent years of the British Reformation, Civil War, and World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Construction of the current church building was begun circa 1108, and was essentially completed around 50 years later. The basic layout for churches at that time was the shape of a cross, with the east end as the top, the transepts making the crossing arm, and the nave as the longer extension at the bottom of the cross. The east end held the altar and choir, or quire, which were used by the clergy during daily masses. The nave was accessible to the lay community. Although medieval British churches are basically oriented east to west, they all vary slightly. When a new church was to be built, the patron saint was selected and the altar location laid out. On the saint&rsquo;s day, a line would be surveyed from the position of the rising sun through the altar site and extending in a westerly direction. This was the orientation of the new building.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In clerical terms, Southwell Minster is a cathedral; but rather than rummage in ecclesiastical definitions, this essay will look at the architectural styles.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The arcade on each side separates the nave from the side aisles, which allow people to move through the church to smaller side chapels. Above the first tier is a second arcade with smaller arches defining the gallery, and above that is another arcade &ndash; smaller still &ndash; which includes windows and is known as the clerestory. The ceiling of Southwell Minster is a wooden barrel vault.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The arches, column capitals, window surrounds, and portals are decorated with carved patterns that are geometric and straightforward. Although the material is stone, its lack of detailed texture gives it a plastic quality, especially when seen in some lights. The stone, Permian sandstone, has a warm cream color, while the heavy arches and massive walls impart a feeling of strength and permanence. This commanding style represented effective propaganda for William the Conqueror, who had invaded Britain in 1066 and imposed strong organizational systems in both the Church and government.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>From Norman to Gothic</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The transepts are also in the Norman style, severe and blunt. But as you move further east and enter the quire, the uncomplicated architecture and decoration gives way to pointed arches and curlicue embellishments. The sense of moving to a different building and place are somewhat confusing at first, until you are fully inside the east end and find yourself enveloped in the Gothic style.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The original east end of Southwell, and of many other medieval cathedrals, was found to be too small once the building was completed, so the old east end was pulled down and replaced with a larger extension in the latest fashion. Although the new east end was built within roughly one hundred years of the original building, architecture had moved on quickly. Now the arches were pointed at the top, and the decoration was more and more ornate. Structurally, new techniques allowed for larger windows than were possible in the Romanesque idiom.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Because the Southwell Chapter House is relatively small, it does not require a center column to support the roof as a larger area would. The octagonal room is topped by a vault carried not only on ribs that reach to the center, but also on cross ribs that span between the main ribs. These intermediate ribs are known as tiercerons, and signify a further development into the more complex and decorated vaults that are an integral part of the English Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic styles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>History and presence</h3>\n"

"<p>As a whole or in its individual parts, Southwell Minster is a brilliant example of medieval architecture in England and its rapid development over 200 years. The building has suffered relatively little damage or major alteration over its thousand-year life. Indeed, part of its appeal is its architectural integrity, as well as the fact that it is a living (i.e., still in use) building.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As the years have passed, new decoration has been added that reflects a functioning parish community &ndash; a baptismal font from 1661, stained glass windows from various centuries, a modern sculpture of Christus Rex from the twentieth century. The church is not overrun with tourists, but is still very much a local parish with an active congregation that continues to use the building, ring the bells, and weave the ties of history into twenty-first century life.</p>\n"

"<p><em>Posas</em> allowed for conversion to take place outside the main church. While this may have been done for practical purposes, pre-Columbian Mexican&nbsp;spiritual ceremonies also took place out of doors. Worshippers were accustomed to gathering in open courtyards to listen to priest-rulers. Another example of the fusion of Christian and indigenous spiritual meaning is presented by the pyramidal shape of the chapels&rsquo; roofs, which were surmounted by highly ornate crosses. Crosses were important symbols for water, fertility, and sustenance prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. Non-Christian, pre-Columbian crosses were often created out of trees and represented the Tree of Life in various rituals. In mission spaces such as Huejotzingo, crosses became a powerful symbol for the source of spiritual life shared by Europeans and indigenous peoples alike. They were placed in the center of monastery atriums as a symbol of the Christian and indigenous <em>axis mundis </em>(world axis). The crosses that topped the posas, of which only the example from below survives, were modeled with similar didactic functions as the large atrium crosses that decorated most sixteenth-century missions in this region. They were carved with a fusion of Mesoamerican and European symbols, offering natives an opportunity to learn about Christ&rsquo;s life, death, and resurrection through familiar regional motifs.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><span>The lion was a royal symbol as well as being connected with the sun as a symbol of the horizon; the fusion of this powerful animal with the head of the pharaoh was an icon that survived and was often used throughout Egyptian history. The king&rsquo;s head is on a smaller scale than the body. This appears to have been due to a defect in the stone; a weakness recognized by the sculptors who compensated by elongating the body.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Directly in front of the Sphinx is a separate temple dedicated to the worship of its cult, but very little is known about it since there are no Old Kingdom texts that refer to the Sphinx or its temple. The temple is similar to Khafre&rsquo;s mortuary temple and has granite pillars forming a colonnade around a central courtyard. &nbsp;However, it is unique in that it has two sanctuaries&mdash;one on the east and one on the west&mdash;likely connected to the rising and setting sun.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>The interior is much simpler than that of Khufu&rsquo;s pyramid, with a single burial chamber, one small subsidiary chamber, and two passageways. The mortuary temple at the pyramid base was more complex than that of Khufu and was filled with statuary of the king--over 52 life-size or larger images originally filled the structure. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Valley Temple</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Khafre&rsquo;s valley temple, located at the east end of the causeway leading from the pyramid base, is beautifully preserved. It was constructed of megalithic blocks sheathed with granite and floors of polished white calcite. Statue bases indicate that an additional 24 images of the pharaoh were originally located in this temple.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Great Sphinx</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Right next to the causeway leading from Khafre&rsquo;s valley temple to the mortuary temple sits the first truly colossal sculpture in Egyptian history: the Great Sphinx. This close association indicates that this massive depiction of a recumbent lion with the head of a king was carved for Khafre.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<br />\n"
"The Sphinx is carved from the bedrock of the Giza plateau, and it appears that the core blocks used to construct the king&rsquo;s valley temple were quarried from the layers of stone that run along the upper sides of this massive image.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Khafre</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The lion was a royal symbol as well as being connected with the sun as a symbol of the horizon; the fusion of this powerful animal with the head of the pharaoh was an icon that survived and was often used throughout Egyptian history. The king&rsquo;s head is on a smaller scale than the body. This appears to have been due to a defect in the stone; a weakness recognized by the sculptors who compensated by elongating the body.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Directly in front of the Sphinx is a separate temple dedicated to the worship of its cult, but very little is known about it since there are no Old Kingdom texts that refer to the Sphinx or its temple. The temple is similar to Khafre&rsquo;s mortuary temple and has granite pillars forming a colonnade around a central courtyard. &nbsp;However, it is unique in that it has two sanctuaries&mdash;one on the east and one on the west&mdash;likely connected to the rising and setting sun.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"The phoenix from folio 56 recto of the Aberdeen Bestiary, written and illuminated in England around 1200. The Bestiary describes this magical bird as building its own funeral pyre and then rising from the ashes.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/dabf0257bf17508dbeec0b1be0c8bc658abe046b.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">The phoenix from folio 56 recto of the Aberdeen Bestiary, written and illuminated in England around 1200. The Bestiary describes this magical bird as building its own funeral pyre and then rising from the ashes.</span></span>Have you ever heard that elephants are afraid of mice? Or that foxes are deceptive? These characterizations of animals come from a medieval book called the Bestiary, or Book of Beasts. Though these books are not known to many today, you are likely familiar with some of their content. The magical beasts in the Harry Potter series come directly from medieval bestiaries. Descriptions of unicorns, phoenixes, basilisks, and centaurs are all included in the text, but misspell &ldquo;bestiary&rdquo; in a Google search and you will likely regret it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Bestiary is a medieval encyclopedia that identifies a selection of animals, plants, and precious stones. Some really exist in nature and others do not. Each entry includes a physical description, an overview of the animal&#39;s supposed characteristics, and a run-down of its moral qualities. Many versions of these books include illustrations. Its worth keeping in mind that Bestiaries pre-date the printing press. They were copied by hand at different times and places, resulting in a wide range of variations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"The beaver from folio 11 recto of the Aberdeen Bestiary, written and illuminated in England around 1200.

The beaver shows off his testicles to escape the hunters.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>From a Christian perspective</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lack of scientific information in each entry makes them entertaining to read. For example, the Bestiary text describes the beaver as a gentle animal whose testicles are valued for their medicinal properties. If a beaver senses that he is being hunted, he will bite off his testicles and throw them to the hunter to save his own life. If a beaver has already done this and is hunted again, he will stand on his hind legs and show the hunter that his testicles are already missing and the hunter will let him go. The text then goes on to give a Christian moralization of the beaver, stating that &ldquo;every man who heeds God&#39;s commandment and wishes to live chastely should cut off all his vices and shameless acts, and cast them from him into the face of the devil&rdquo; (source).</p>\n"

The Bestiary describes this magical bird as building its own funeral pyre and then rising from the ashes.</span></span>Have you ever heard that elephants are afraid of mice? Or that foxes are deceptive? These characterizations of animals come from a medieval book called the Bestiary, or Book of Beasts. Though these books are not known to many today, you are likely familiar with some of their content. The magical beasts in the Harry Potter series come directly from medieval bestiaries. Descriptions of unicorns, phoenixes, basilisks, and centaurs are all included in the text, but misspell &ldquo;bestiary&rdquo; in a Google search and you will likely regret it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Bestiary is a medieval encyclopedia that identifies a selection of animals, plants, and precious stones. Some really exist in nature and others do not. Each entry includes a physical description, an overview of the animal&#39;s supposed characteristics, and a run-down of its moral qualities. Many versions of these books include illustrations. Its worth keeping in mind that Bestiaries pre-date the printing press. They were copied by hand at different times and places, resulting in a wide range of variations.</p>\n"

"<h3>From a Christian perspective</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lack of scientific information in each entry makes them entertaining to read. For example, the Bestiary text describes the beaver as a gentle animal whose testicles are valued for their medicinal properties. If a beaver senses that he is being hunted, he will bite off his testicles and throw them to the hunter to save his own life. If a beaver has already done this and is hunted again, he will stand on his hind legs and show the hunter that his testicles are already missing and the hunter will let him go. The text then goes on to give a Christian moralization of the beaver, stating that &ldquo;every man who heeds God&#39;s commandment and wishes to live chastely should cut off all his vices and shameless acts, and cast them from him into the face of the devil&rdquo; (source).</p>\n"

The settlement grew quickly and, for reasons unknown, the inhabitants soon constructed a substantial stone wall and exterior ditch around their town, complete with a stone tower almost eight meters high, set against the inner side of the wall. Theories as to the function of this wall range from military defense to keeping out animal predators to even combating the natural rising of the level of the ground surrounding the settlement.

"<h3>A prolific career</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Rembrandt, Self-Portrait Drawing at a Window, 1648, etching, drypoint and burin on ivory laid paper, 15.6 x 13 cm (Art Institute of Chicago)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/906354a3e4abb43d426c724aefbc4d3391df968d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Rembrandt, <em>Self-Portrait Drawing at a Window</em>, 1648, etching, drypoint and burin on ivory laid paper, 15.6 x 13 cm (Art Institute of Chicago)</span></span>It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn within the history of Western art. Indeed, Rembrandt is considered one of the foremost artists of the Dutch Baroque period, and even if he had never picked up a paintbrush, he would have been famous both in his day and ours as a printmaker of particular brilliance and as a prolific teacher. In a career that lasted nearly forty years, Rembrandt completed approximately 400 paintings, more than 1,000 drawings, and nearly 300 engravings. Although he spent his entire life north of the alps, had he been Italian and lived a century or so earlier, he likely would have joined his Italian brethren&mdash;Donatello, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael, as a member of the famed cartoon <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Patrons: a wealthy, Protestant, and expanding middle class</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But as time and place would have it, Rembrandt was neither Italian nor a part of the Renaissance. Instead, Rembrandt was born in Leiden in 1606. This place and time&mdash;Holland during the height of the expansion of the wealthy mercantile class during the middle half of the seventeenth century&mdash;served Rembrandt well through his long career. The Catholic Church often commissioned Italian artists at this time to undertake large-scale projects to promote religious ideology in support of the Counter-Reformation. Without the Catholic Church in Holland to commission art, Rembrandt and his fellow Dutch artists were lavishly supported by a wealthy, Protestant, and expanding middle class. This group of patrons enthusiastically commissioned works of art with their increasing discretionary income.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>New subjects (including group portraits)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many different types of art became popular during the Dutch Baroque period. Genre paintings&mdash;small paintings of everyday life&mdash;were exceptionally popular with a middle-class clientele, as were still lifes, landscapes, and prints. The majority of these kinds of art were both affordable and small enough to be easily displayed within an average home. Larger and more compositionally complicated, group portraiture also became popular in Holland during the seventeenth century. This was a mode of painting that was often placed in a public space so that the image could promote a particular organization.</p>\n"

"<h3>Relocating to Amsterdam&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although several of Rembrandt&rsquo;s most well-known paintings are group portraits&mdash;<em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp</em> among others&mdash;his early education in Leiden, first at a Latin school and then later at the university, suggest that he was destined for a vocation other than art. However, by the time he was sixteen he decided he wanted to be a painter and a draughtsman. After finding quick success in Leiden during the 1620s, Rembrandt relocated to Amsterdam in 1631, a wise professional decision, as this was then one of the wealthiest and largest cities in Europe.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Just a year after his arrival, Rembrandt was offered the commission to complete a group portrait of the Amsterdam Surgeon&rsquo;s Guild, an image that in time has come to be known rather simply as <em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp</em>. It is remarkable that Rembrandt received this commission as a newcomer to Amsterdam when there were other native-born artists available. Thomas de Keyser (above) and Nicolaes Pickenoy (below), for example, were older and more experienced in the realm of group portraiture. Whereas another artist may have simply recreated a previous group image&mdash;inserting new heads in place of old ones&mdash;Rembrandt created something new, and in doing so, completed one of the most recognizable images in the history of painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dr. Nicolaes Tulp&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Dr. Nicolaes Tulp was appointed praelector (like a professor or lecturer) of the Amsterdam Anatomy Guild in 1628. One of the responsibilities of this position was to deliver a yearly public lecture on some aspect of human anatomy. The lecture in 1632 occurred on 16 January, and this is the scene that Rembrandt depicts in paint in <em>The Anatomy of Lesson of Dr. Tulp</em>.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Dr. Tulp instructing his pupils (detail), Rembrandt van Rijn, The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp, 1632, oil on canvas, 169.5x 216.5 cm (Mauritshuis, The Hague)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1e9e7f4a05c3b786751684213052298d51340829.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Dr. Tulp displaying the flexors in a cadaver&#39;s arm (detail), Rembrandt van Rijn, <em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp</em>, 1632, oil on canvas, 169.5 x 216.5 cm (Mauritshuis, The Hague)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This is a more complicated composition than it at first appears. Understandably, the focal point of the image is Dr. Tulp, the doctor who is shown displaying the flexors of the cadaver&rsquo;s left arm. Rembrandt notes the doctor&rsquo;s significance by showing him as the only person who wears a hat. Seven colleagues surround Dr. Tulp, and they look in a variety of directions&mdash;some gaze at the cadaver, some stare at the lecturer, and some peek directly at the viewer. Each face displays a facial expression that is deeply personal and psychological. The cadaver&mdash;a recently executed thief named Adriaen Adriaenszoon&mdash;lies nearly parallel to the picture plane. Viewing the illuminated body from his head to his feet brings into focus a book&mdash;likely Andreas Vesalius&rsquo;s <em>De humani corporis fabrica</em> (<em>Fabric of the Human Body</em>, 1543)&mdash;propped up in the lower right corner.

"<h3>A prolific career</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Rembrandt, Self-Portrait Drawing at a Window, 1648, etching, drypoint and burin on ivory laid paper, 15.6 x 13 cm (Art Institute of Chicago)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/906354a3e4abb43d426c724aefbc4d3391df968d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Rembrandt, <em>Self-Portrait Drawing at a Window</em>, 1648, etching, drypoint and burin on ivory laid paper, 15.6 x 13 cm (Art Institute of Chicago)</span></span>It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn within the history of Western art. Indeed, Rembrandt is considered one of the foremost artists of the Dutch Baroque period, and even if he had never picked up a paintbrush, he would have been famous both in his day and ours as a printmaker of particular brilliance and as a prolific teacher. In a career that lasted nearly forty years, Rembrandt completed approximately 400 paintings, more than 1,000 drawings, and nearly 300 engravings. Although he spent his entire life north of the alps, had he been Italian and lived a century or so earlier, he likely would have joined his Italian brethren&mdash;Donatello, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael, as a member of the famed cartoon <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Patrons: a wealthy, Protestant, and expanding middle class</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But as time and place would have it, Rembrandt was neither Italian nor a part of the Renaissance. Instead, Rembrandt was born in Leiden in 1606. This place and time&mdash;Holland during the height of the expansion of the wealthy mercantile class during the middle half of the seventeenth century&mdash;served Rembrandt well through his long career. The Catholic Church often commissioned Italian artists at this time to undertake large-scale projects to promote religious ideology in support of the Counter-Reformation. Without the Catholic Church in Holland to commission art, Rembrandt and his fellow Dutch artists were lavishly supported by a wealthy, Protestant, and expanding middle class. This group of patrons enthusiastically commissioned works of art with their increasing discretionary income.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>New subjects (including group portraits)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many different types of art became popular during the Dutch Baroque period. Genre paintings&mdash;small paintings of everyday life&mdash;were exceptionally popular with a middle-class clientele, as were still lifes, landscapes, and prints. The majority of these kinds of art were both affordable and small enough to be easily displayed within an average home. Larger and more compositionally complicated, group portraiture also became popular in Holland during the seventeenth century. This was a mode of painting that was often placed in a public space so that the image could promote a particular organization.</p>\n"

"<h3>Relocating to Amsterdam&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although several of Rembrandt&rsquo;s most well-known paintings are group portraits&mdash;<em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp</em> among others&mdash;his early education in Leiden, first at a Latin school and then later at the university, suggest that he was destined for a vocation other than art. However, by the time he was sixteen he decided he wanted to be a painter and a draughtsman. After finding quick success in Leiden during the 1620s, Rembrandt relocated to Amsterdam in 1631, a wise professional decision, as this was then one of the wealthiest and largest cities in Europe.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Just a year after his arrival, Rembrandt was offered the commission to complete a group portrait of the Amsterdam Surgeon&rsquo;s Guild, an image that in time has come to be known rather simply as <em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp</em>. It is remarkable that Rembrandt received this commission as a newcomer to Amsterdam when there were other native-born artists available. Thomas de Keyser (above) and Nicolaes Pickenoy (below), for example, were older and more experienced in the realm of group portraiture. Whereas another artist may have simply recreated a previous group image&mdash;inserting new heads in place of old ones&mdash;Rembrandt created something new, and in doing so, completed one of the most recognizable images in the history of painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dr. Nicolaes Tulp&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>博士 Nicolaes Tulp was appointed praelector (like a professor or lecturer) of the Amsterdam Anatomy Guild in 1628. One of the responsibilities of this position was to deliver a yearly public lecture on some aspect of human anatomy. The lecture in 1632 occurred on 16 January, and this is the scene that Rembrandt depicts in paint in <em>The Anatomy of Lesson of Dr. Tulp</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Dr. Tulp instructing his pupils (detail), Rembrandt van Rijn, The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp, 1632, oil on canvas, 169.5x 216.5 cm (Mauritshuis, The Hague)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1e9e7f4a05c3b786751684213052298d51340829.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Dr. Tulp displaying the flexors in a cadaver&#39;s arm (detail), Rembrandt van Rijn, <em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp</em>, 1632, oil on canvas, 169.5 x 216.5 cm (Mauritshuis, The Hague)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This is a more complicated composition than it at first appears. Understandably, the focal point of the image is Dr. Tulp, the doctor who is shown displaying the flexors of the cadaver&rsquo;s left arm. Rembrandt notes the doctor&rsquo;s significance by showing him as the only person who wears a hat. Seven colleagues surround Dr. Tulp, and they look in a variety of directions&mdash;some gaze at the cadaver, some stare at the lecturer, and some peek directly at the viewer. Each face displays a facial expression that is deeply personal and psychological. The cadaver&mdash;a recently executed thief named Adriaen Adriaenszoon&mdash;lies nearly parallel to the picture plane. Viewing the illuminated body from his head to his feet brings into focus a book&mdash;likely Andreas Vesalius&rsquo;s <em>De humani corporis fabrica</em> (<em>Fabric of the Human Body</em>, 1543)&mdash;propped up in the lower right corner. In all, Rembrandt shows nine distinct figures, but does so as if they are a unified group.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Like the Medici, they employed this kind of sacred patronage to expiate themselves against charges of immoral luxuriousness and wealth, as well as to quell suspicions of usury (charging interest, which was considered a sin). &nbsp;The irony, of course, is that a fresco insurance policy as grand as this one was only obtained at great cost, and was intended to attract maximum public attention. The extravagant &quot;humility&quot;&nbsp;of&nbsp;rich patrons (the Medici, the Tornabuoni and others), adorning the city with thinly-veiled monuments to themselves, came to be considered a demonstration of virtuous public service, celebrated as civic <em>magnificenza</em>.&nbsp; I suppose Donald Trump may see&nbsp;himself in the much the same way, scattering his showy, shiny monuments across&nbsp;America.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Bible in Florence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ghirlandaio loved Florence and fresco, and he adored the world and all of its charms. &nbsp; In contrast to the solid, stoic and severe formal classicism of the earlier generation of Alberti, Brunelleschi and Masaccio, Ghirlandaio loved form, color, variety, narrative and the quotidian (everyday)&nbsp;details of Florentine daily life. Although the primary narratives depicted in the Tornabuoni Chapel are scenes from the Life of John the Baptist and from the Life of the Virgin, these biblical scenes unfold in the streets of Florence, often staged in what appear to be temporary stage-sets, theatrical triumphal arches and temples, strewn with various bits of ancient Roman bric-a-brac, hastily assembled for the biblical actors. When you peer through the arches of these Lego-land wonders, you see the solid, sturdy, stone medieval fa&ccedil;ades of Florence&mdash;no matter where he goes in his imagination, for Ghirlandaio, Florence is the whole world. The conflation of time past and time present in the frescoes is also underscored by the inclusion, in many scenes, of late-fifteenth century members of the Tornabuoni family in the biblical subjects, floating across the stage like ghostly apparitions. For over 500 years these vivid frescoes have played across the walls of the chapel like a continuously looping documentary film, chronicling the living history of Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The painter &nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Domenico Ghirlandaio&nbsp;is often given rather short shrift by art historians existing, as he did, suspended between the austere Albertian mathematical rationalism of the fifteenth century and the agonized, self-flagellant extravagances of Michelangelo, to whom he served as painting master before he took up residence in the Medici garden. Trained in the family workshop, Ghirlandaio was an acknowledged fresco expert, and while his style is sometimes dismissed as &quot;prosaic,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it happily idiomatic, clearly revelling in the quotidian joys of observing the world around him&mdash;which is not to say that he lacked imagination. He had a distinct penchant for embellishing severe classical architectural settings with fanciful, fluid and flirtatious decorative flourishes and then peopling them with the most extraordinarily vivid and lively figures. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Every picture tells a story: the narratives</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The overall narrative program of the chapel is relatively simple, covering the two lateral walls, and part of the rear wall (around and above the magnificent stained-glass windows) in superimposed registers, &nbsp;culminating in frescoes of the Four Evangelists on the ceiling. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>There are a number of frescoes depicting standard scenes associated with the life of the Baptist&mdash;chiefly his wanderings in the desert, during which he realizes his avocation, and his subsequent Baptism of Christ. &nbsp;But people sometimes forget that John, like Christ, was the result of a miraculous pregnancy. His parents, Zachariah and Elizabeth, had no children, but God heard&nbsp;Zachariah&rsquo;s prayers and the elderly Elizabeth found herself pregnant, three months in advance of the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary (the moment when Mary conceives Christ).&nbsp;The cycle therefore features the lovely moment of the <em>Visitation</em>, when Elizabeth and Mary encounter each other while pregnant and the unborn John &ldquo;leaps up&rdquo; in his mother&rsquo;s womb in recognition of the presence of Christ (Luke 1: 39-45). &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Among the other scenes here, the one in which <em>Zaccariah Writes the Name of John</em> is the most unusual. &nbsp;At the moment of the angel Gabriel&rsquo;s announcement of Elizabeth&rsquo;s pregnancy, Zaccariah asked for a sign as proof; &nbsp;because he had spoken doubtfully, he lost the power of speech, regaining it only after writing on a tablet, at Elizabeth&rsquo;s urging, &quot;His name is John&quot;&nbsp;(Luke 1:18-22). The emphasis in this scene on written evidence is, perhaps, an allusion to the world of documents and contracts that characterized the Tornabuoni banking world.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The altar wall</h3>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, Annunciation, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3b16c93c664fcbd7afccfa0a3c71c370e3390be6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>Annunciation</em>, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span>On the lowest register, the altar wall features kneeling portraits of the donors, Giovanni Tornabuoni and his wife Francesca Pitti.&nbsp;In the upper registers, around and above the triple-mullioned stained-glass windows, we see the <em>Annunciation</em> and <em>St John in the Desert</em>, then scenes from the lives of two prominent Dominican saints, appropriate in a Dominican church. &nbsp;In one, Saint&nbsp;Dominic Tests Books in Fire and in the other we see the Death of Saint&nbsp;Peter Martyr. The cycle on this wall culminates in a <em>Coronation of the Virgin with Saints</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Again, for Ghirlandaio, God is clearly always in the details. The Saint&nbsp;Dominic scene depicts a moment in the saint&rsquo;s fight against the Cathars (who professed a belief in the dualistic principles of good and evil, God and Satan, in opposition to the monotheism of the Catholic faith), in which only his books survived a test of fire when thrown into the flames alongside the Cathar&rsquo;s &quot;heretical&quot;&nbsp;texts.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>This is interesting because of its juxtaposition with the <em>Death of Peter Martyr</em>; a preacher from Verona whose family was sympathetic to the Cathar cause. He returned to orthodoxy when he met Saint&nbsp;Dominic. As Shakespeare says, &quot;the truth will out.&quot;&nbsp;I have no idea why late-fifteenth-century Dominicans were concerned with the Cathars, but it&rsquo;s possible that the reference to Catharism here was intended by the Tornabuoni to &quot;out&quot;&nbsp;rival merchant families in Florence, like the Pulci, whose ancestors were associated with the Cathars. Thus the personal is intertwined with the political, all interwoven into the marvelous textures of Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The Church of Santa Maria Novella, adjacent to the&nbsp;train station of the same name, is a treasure-house of Florentine art of the Renaissance. &nbsp;</p>\n"

Like the Medici, they employed this kind of sacred patronage to expiate themselves against charges of immoral luxuriousness and wealth, as well as to quell suspicions of usury (charging interest, which was considered a sin). &nbsp;The irony, of course, is that a fresco insurance policy as grand as this one was only obtained at great cost, and was intended to attract maximum public attention. The extravagant &quot;humility&quot;&nbsp;of&nbsp;rich patrons (the Medici, the Tornabuoni and others), adorning the city with thinly-veiled monuments to themselves, came to be considered a demonstration of virtuous public service, celebrated as civic <em>magnificenza</em>.&nbsp; I suppose Donald Trump may see&nbsp;himself in the much the same way, scattering his showy, shiny monuments across&nbsp;America.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Bible in Florence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ghirlandaio loved Florence and fresco, and he adored the world and all of its charms. &nbsp; In contrast to the solid, stoic and severe formal classicism of the earlier generation of Alberti, Brunelleschi and Masaccio, Ghirlandaio loved form, color, variety, narrative and the quotidian (everyday)&nbsp;details of Florentine daily life. Although the primary narratives depicted in the Tornabuoni Chapel are scenes from the Life of John the Baptist and from the Life of the Virgin, these biblical scenes unfold in the streets of Florence, often staged in what appear to be temporary stage-sets, theatrical triumphal arches and temples, strewn with various bits of ancient Roman bric-a-brac, hastily assembled for the biblical actors. When you peer through the arches of these Lego-land wonders, you see the solid, sturdy, stone medieval fa&ccedil;ades of Florence&mdash;no matter where he goes in his imagination, for Ghirlandaio, Florence is the whole world. The conflation of time past and time present in the frescoes is also underscored by the inclusion, in many scenes, of late-fifteenth century members of the Tornabuoni family in the biblical subjects, floating across the stage like ghostly apparitions. For over 500 years these vivid frescoes have played across the walls of the chapel like a continuously looping documentary film, chronicling the living history of Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The painter &nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Domenico Ghirlandaio&nbsp;is often given rather short shrift by art historians existing, as he did, suspended between the austere Albertian mathematical rationalism of the fifteenth century and the agonized, self-flagellant extravagances of Michelangelo, to whom he served as painting master before he took up residence in the Medici garden. Trained in the family workshop, Ghirlandaio was an acknowledged fresco expert, and while his style is sometimes dismissed as &quot;prosaic,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it happily idiomatic, clearly revelling in the quotidian joys of observing the world around him&mdash;which is not to say that he lacked imagination. He had a distinct penchant for embellishing severe classical architectural settings with fanciful, fluid and flirtatious decorative flourishes and then peopling them with the most extraordinarily vivid and lively figures. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Every picture tells a story: the narratives</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The overall narrative program of the chapel is relatively simple, covering the two lateral walls, and part of the rear wall (around and above the magnificent stained-glass windows) in superimposed registers, &nbsp;culminating in frescoes of the Four Evangelists on the ceiling. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Among the other scenes here, the one in which <em>Zaccariah Writes the Name of John</em> is the most unusual. &nbsp;At the moment of the angel Gabriel&rsquo;s announcement of Elizabeth&rsquo;s pregnancy, Zaccariah asked for a sign as proof; &nbsp;because he had spoken doubtfully, he lost the power of speech, regaining it only after writing on a tablet, at Elizabeth&rsquo;s urging, &quot;His name is John&quot;&nbsp;(Luke 1:18-22). The emphasis in this scene on written evidence is, perhaps, an allusion to the world of documents and contracts that characterized the Tornabuoni banking world.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, Annunciation, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3b16c93c664fcbd7afccfa0a3c71c370e3390be6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>Annunciation</em>, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span>On the lowest register, the altar wall features kneeling portraits of the donors, Giovanni Tornabuoni and his wife Francesca Pitti.&nbsp;In the upper registers, around and above the triple-mullioned stained-glass windows, we see the <em>Annunciation</em> and <em>St John in the Desert</em>, then scenes from the lives of two prominent Dominican saints, appropriate in a Dominican church. &nbsp;In one, Saint&nbsp;Dominic Tests Books in Fire and in the other we see the Death of Saint&nbsp;Peter Martyr. The cycle on this wall culminates in a <em>Coronation of the Virgin with Saints</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Again, for Ghirlandaio, God is clearly always in the details. The Saint&nbsp;Dominic scene depicts a moment in the saint&rsquo;s fight against the Cathars (who professed a belief in the dualistic principles of good and evil, God and Satan, in opposition to the monotheism of the Catholic faith), in which only his books survived a test of fire when thrown into the flames alongside the Cathar&rsquo;s &quot;heretical&quot;&nbsp;texts.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>This is interesting because of its juxtaposition with the <em>Death of Peter Martyr</em>; a preacher from Verona whose family was sympathetic to the Cathar cause. He returned to orthodoxy when he met Saint&nbsp;Dominic. As Shakespeare says, &quot;the truth will out.&quot;&nbsp;I have no idea why late-fifteenth-century Dominicans were concerned with the Cathars, but it&rsquo;s possible that the reference to Catharism here was intended by the Tornabuoni to &quot;out&quot;&nbsp;rival merchant families in Florence, like the Pulci, whose ancestors were associated with the Cathars. Thus the personal is intertwined with the political, all interwoven into the marvelous textures of Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Similarly, Louis&rsquo; legs, which Rigaud has cleverly and prominently displayed, are rather well defined for an aging king. Louis&rsquo; advancing age (he would die fourteen years after this portrait) is betrayed by his lined face, slight jowls, and double chin; the king was reportedly in ill health and had to have several teeth extracted due to infection. It is no coincidence that Louis is posed with his majestic robe draped over his shoulder to reveal his lower limbs: Louis had been a ballet dancer in his youth and prided himself on his dancer&rsquo;s legs. The legs, while in contrast to his aged face, suggest a vital and vigorous man, still in the prime of his power. Rigaud tempers the monarch&rsquo;s timeworn face by reminding the viewer of Louis&rsquo; athletic past; the heeled shoes are not only flattering but add several precious inches onto Louis&rsquo; height. Here, Louis is identifiable&mdash;clearly the portrait is of the king in the later years of his life&mdash;yet also idealized, his well-toned legs and lustrous hair preternaturally preserved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Success&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rigaud&rsquo;s portrait, originally commissioned as a gift for Louis&rsquo; grandson, Philip V of Spain, was so well received that Louis ultimately chose to keep it and sent a copy in its place. Rigaud&nbsp;so successfully captured power of&nbsp;Louis XIV that the image was placed over the throne and in the king&rsquo;s absence, the painting served as his proxy and courtiers were forbidden to turn their backs on the painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Rigaud tempers the monarch&rsquo;s timeworn face by reminding the viewer of Louis&rsquo; athletic past; the heeled shoes are not only flattering but add several precious inches onto Louis&rsquo; height. Here, Louis is identifiable&mdash;clearly the portrait is of the king in the later years of his life&mdash;yet also idealized, his well-toned legs and lustrous hair preternaturally preserved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Success&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rigaud&rsquo;s portrait, originally commissioned as a gift for Louis&rsquo; grandson, Philip V of Spain, was so well received that Louis ultimately chose to keep it and sent a copy in its place. Louis XIV so successfully captured the power of the king that the image was placed over the throne and in the king&rsquo;s absence, the painting served as his proxy and courtiers were forbidden to turn their backs on the painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Background</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>2012-13 was my fifth year with the High Tech High organization and my fourth year as a teacher. &nbsp;&nbsp;I teach 8th graders math and science. I cover physical science and mathematics including topics in algebra and pre algebra. &nbsp;I co-teach these students along with my humanities teaching partner. &nbsp;Often our projects are multidisciplinary.&nbsp; Many of these projects incorporate applied mathematics, but I also run a mathematics program in parallel with the projects. &nbsp;This mathematics program is roughly 50% procedural practice and 50% in depth problem solving. &nbsp;It is in the procedural practice of mathematics that I have used Khan Academy most often.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Making the decision to use Khan Academy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Several years ago I became frustrated with how inefficient I was at helping students master certain mathematical techniques. &nbsp;My classroom is untracked and the spectrum of previous skills and abilities can be wide. &nbsp;I never felt that I was achieving a level of effectiveness, as a teacher that was useful to my kids.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I started looking into software solutions. I tried several and they had real benefits. &nbsp;The ability to differentiate widely with infinite problem generation and comprehensive reporting were all improvements over what I could accomplish without them. &nbsp;I used another program for an entire year before I settled on Khan Academy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One of the reasons I made the switch was the ease of use of the Khan Academy interface. &nbsp;Other teachers had asked me to run a workshop on how to effectively implement the program I was currently using and despite the workshop, many of those teachers became frustrated with the learning curve necessary to become proficient with this other application. &nbsp;I wanted to use a program that I could recommend to other teachers and feel like they could begin using effectively right away.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Reporting was also a key reason for switching to Khan. &nbsp;The reports provided me with actionable data that I used to plan my days. When students came into class ,I had an plan ready for them based on what the reports were telling me about where they were progressing. &nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if there was a group of 6 students who were struggling with linear equations, I would allow that group to work as a study group in the hallway. &nbsp;If not, I could assign a peer tutor to work with those students. &nbsp;I could check on that same group after class and see if improvements had been made or if they were still struggling.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Starting out with Khan Academy in my class</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>My initial goal for Khan Academy was to have it supplement material that I was already using in the classroom. &nbsp;From the first day, I was able to find ways to use it effectively. &nbsp;I was already using a self-paced curriculum, but I used worksheets and frequent advancement assessments. &nbsp;I matched Khan Academy videos and exercises to the materials related to one unit that a group of my students were struggling with. &nbsp;By initially using the Khan Academy site to supplement a small part of my curriculum I was able to work through the learning curves and figure out what I thought would be useful in my classroom on a broader scale.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One reason that I have stayed with Khan Academy is that it is highly adaptable. &nbsp;The site provides tools - but does not dictate how the tools should be used or force users to follow any path through their site. &nbsp;This was important to me because I value the autonomy I have in curriculum design, I value my choices as a teacher, and I do not think that there is a single best way to approach learning or teaching. &nbsp;I welcome tools that I can use to design my own solutions but am wary of sites or programs that enforce or their own pedagogy. Over time, as I decided on my own best practices, I integrated my classroom with the site quite a bit. &nbsp;But even on the first day I was able to give kids extra practice and extra resources.</p>\n"

"<h3>Buddhism in China</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Buddhism probably arrived in China during the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E. -&nbsp;220 C.E.), and became a central feature of Chinese culture during the period of division that followed. Buddhist teaching ascribed great merit to the reproduction of images of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, in which the artisans had to follow strict rules of iconography.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A twelfth-century catalogue of the Chinese imperial painting collection lists Daoist and Buddhist works from the time of Gu Kaizhi (c.&nbsp;344-406 C.E.) onwards.

"<h3>The Valley of the Thousand Buddhas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What has survived from the Tang period (618-906) is an important collection of Buddhist paintings on silk and paper, found&nbsp;in Cave 17, in the Valley of the Thousand Buddhas at the Chinese end of the Silk Road. Since Dunhuang was under Tibetan occupation at this time, its cave shrines and paintings escaped destruction.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The &quot;Caves of the Thousand Buddhas,&quot;&nbsp;or <em>Qianfodong</em>, are situated at Mogao, about 25 kilometres south-east of the oasis town of Dunhuang in Gansu province, western China, in the middle of the desert. By the late fourth century, the area had become a busy desert crossroads on the caravan routes of the Silk Road linking China and the West. Traders, pilgrims and other travelers stopped at the oasis town to stock up with provisions, pray for the journey ahead or give thanks for their survival.&nbsp;At about this time wandering monks carved the first caves into the long cliff stretching almost 2 kilometers in length along the Daquan River.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Over the next millennium more than 1000 caves of varying sizes were dug. Around five hundred of these were decorated as cave temples, carved from the gravel conglomerate of the escarpment. This material was not suitable for sculpture, as at other famous Buddhist cave temples at Yungang and Longmen.&nbsp;The Caves of the Thousand Buddhas gained their name from the legend of a monk who dreamt he saw a cloud with a thousand Buddhas floating over the valley.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Its entrance concealed behind a wall painting, the cave remained hidden from sight for centuries, until 1900, when it was discovered by Wang Yuanlu, a Daoist monk who had appointed himself abbot and guardian of the caves. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first Western expedition to reach Dunhuang, led by a Hungarian count, arrived in 1879. More than twenty years later one of its members, Lajos L&oacute;czy, drew the attention of the Hungarian-born Marc Aurel Stein, by then a well-known British archaeologist and explorer, to the importance of the caves. Stein reached Dunhuang and Mogao in 1907 during his second expedition to Central Asia. By this time, he had heard rumors of the walled-in cave and its contents.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After delicate negotiations with Wang Yuanlu, Stein negotiated access to the cave. &quot;Heaped up in layers,&quot;&nbsp;Stein wrote, &quot;but without any order, there appeared in the dim light of the priest&#39;s little lamp a solid mass of manuscript bundles rising to a height of nearly ten feet.... Not in the driest soil could relics of a ruined site have so completely escaped injury as they had here in a carefully selected rock chamber, where, hidden behind a brick wall, .... these masses of manuscripts had lain undisturbed for centuries.&quot;&nbsp;(M. Aurel Stein, <em>Ruins of Desert Cathay </em>(1912; reprint, New York, Dover, 1987).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The abbot eventually sold Stein seven thousand complete manuscripts and six thousand fragments, as well as several cases loaded with paintings, embroideries and other artifacts; the money was used to fund restoration work at the caves.The manuscripts are now in the British Library and the paintings have been divided between the National Museum in New Delhi and the British Museum, where over three hundred paintings on silk, hemp and paper are kept.</p>\n"

Euthymides had a clear sense of achievement and was indeed proud of his work, boastfully challenging his friend and rival&mdash;Euphronios. He would see Euphronios often, as well as other painters in the Kerameikos&mdash;the potter&rsquo;s quarter in Athens. They would be curious to see one another&rsquo;s new work, sometimes with appreciation, sometimes with a bit of jealousy. In the evenings they often had a good time together at a symposium&nbsp;(a kind of ancient Greek male drinking party). They would drink wine mixed with water, become garrulous, loud and&mdash;if drinking went on for too long&mdash;they might even start singing and even dancing. Perhaps what is depicted on this amphora is a scene similar to those Euthymides witnessed at one of these long parties.&nbsp;Euphronios indeed was a master potter and painter, and Euthymides knew that and had a full appreciation for his work. He thought however, that his figures seemed much more lively, caught in a split of a moment, in a dancing movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beginnings of red-figure painting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Euthymides worked mainly between 515 and 500 B.C.E., in a time when artists were exploring the possibilities of red-figure technique, invented in Athens around 530 B.C.E. Both Euthymides and Euphronios belonged to a kind of camaraderie of artists, often dubbed the &ldquo;Pioneer Group&quot; by art historians&mdash;referring to their innovative efforts in the new technique. In the red-figure technique, an artist sketches figures on the&nbsp;red clay of a freshly fashioned vessel, then covers all the background with a slip (a liquid clay), which&nbsp;turns black after final firing.

Euthymides had a clear sense of achievement and was indeed proud of his work, boastfully challenging his friend and rival&mdash;Euphronios. He would see Euphronios often, as well as other painters in the Kerameikos&mdash;the potter&rsquo;s quarter in Athens. They would be curious to see one another&rsquo;s new work, sometimes with appreciation, sometimes with a bit of jealousy. In the evenings they often had a good time together at a symposium&nbsp;(a kind of ancient Greek male drinking party). They would drink wine mixed with water, become garrulous, loud and&mdash;if drinking went on for too long&mdash;they might even start singing and even dancing. Perhaps what is depicts on this amphora&nbsp;is a scene similar to those Euthymides&nbsp;witnessed at one of these long parties? Euphronios indeed was a master potter and painter, and Euthymides knew that and had a full appreciation for his work. He thought however, that his figures seemed much more lively, caught in a split of a moment, in a dancing movement.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beginnings of red-figure painting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Euthymides worked mainly between 515 and 500 B.C.E., in a time when artists were exploring the possibilities of red-figure technique, invented in Athens around 530 B.C.E. Both Euthymides and Euphronios belonged to a kind of camaraderie of artists, often dubbed the &ldquo;Pioneer Group&quot; by art historians&mdash;referring to their innovative efforts in the new technique. In the red-figure technique, an artist sketches figures on the&nbsp;red clay of a freshly fashioned vessel, then covers all the background with a slip (a liquid clay), which&nbsp;turns black after final firing. Details, like elements of anatomy, folds of drapery, etc. &nbsp;can be freely added with a thin brush; the slip can be darker, sometimes more diluted, brownish, adding even more variety. In the&nbsp;black-figure technique which was used previously, an artist had to fill the figures with slip, and then incise the details with a sharp burin, which was much more difficult to handle. At the time of the&nbsp;&ldquo;Pioneers,&rdquo;&nbsp; there is a general trend in Greek art to observe the reality and represent human body more realistically, leaving the more stiff archaic models behind.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Of the many types of Surrealist objects that were produced, two important features are present in Man Ray&#39;s <em>The Gift</em>.

"<h3>Sex, Booze and 18th-Century Britain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you ever needed proof that the sex, booze and a rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll lifestyle was not a twentieth century invention, you need look no further than the satirical prints of William Hogarth. He held up a moralising mirror to eighteenth-century Britain; the harlots, the womanisers&mdash;even the clergy could not escape. Hogarth&rsquo;s prints play out the sins of eighteenth-century London in a kind of visual theatre that was entirely new and novel in their day.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4eefc3da580ebbc11899b6a2775d4c819854f9c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Harlot&#39;s Progress, plate 1</em>, 1732, etching with engraving on paper,&nbsp;31.4 x 38 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first example of these prints, which Hogarth himself termed &lsquo;modern moral subjects&rsquo;, was <em>A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress</em>. In this series, we meet the fresh faced Moll Hackabout as she arrives for the first time in London. Moll is soon preyed upon by a brothel keeper and she descends into prostitution. The tale ends with her premature death from a sexually transmitted disease, aged just twenty-three. Despite its dark subject matter <em>A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress</em> was a huge success. These prints reference characters types who were well known to their contemporary London audience. For example Moll&rsquo;s madam was the real-life Elizabeth Needham, keeper of an exclusive London brothel and her first patron, the renowned love-rat and convicted rapist, Colonel Francis Charteris.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress&nbsp;</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These sly nods to the bad guys of the day not only made the prints hugely relevant and enjoyable to their target audience but it also made them incredibly popular. <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> (1735) was Hogarth&rsquo;s second series and proved to be just as well loved. The main character is Tom Rakewell&mdash;a rake being a old fashioned term for a man of loose morals or a womaniser. Tom&rsquo;s name is intentionally general and in a modern equivalent, he might be called &lsquo;Mr. Immoral.&rsquo; Tom is not unique, he could be any number of people in eighteenth-century Britain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The series opens with a chaotic scene: Tom&rsquo;s father, who was a rich merchant, has died and Tom has returned from Oxford University to collect and spend his late father&rsquo;s wealth. He also wastes no time in rejecting his pregnant fiance, Sarah Young, by attempting to pay her off. Hogarth laces all his prints with clues to help us decode the scene. Here we can see Sarah sobbing into a hankie whilst holding her engagement ring in her hand. Her mother stands behind her angrily clutching the love letters Tom once wrote to her daughter and he holds out a handful of coins in an attempt to get rid of them. Sarah pops up throughout these prints representing a more wholesome life that he could have had.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/926ec21957ded9b4cc6541dbe73bd770018ce6c9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 2, &quot;Surrounded by Artists and Professors,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper, 35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>A Fashionable Life</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the next scene (<em>&quot;Surrounded by Artists and Professors,&quot; </em>above) Tom has already moved from his cosy, if slightly shabby family home into his new bachelor pad surrounded by a dance master, a music teacher, a poet, a tailor, a landscape gardener, a body guard and a jockey all offering their services to help Tom complete his fashionable lifestyle. He is dressed in his nightclothes indicating that he has just woken: those who wish to exploit his new found wealth are wasting no time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom&rsquo;s fashionable life also comes with fashionable vices and soon we see him in the Rose Tavern with a group of prostitutes (see <em>&quot;The Tavern Scene,&quot;</em> below). He sits on the lap of one who caresses him with one hand whilst robbing him of his watch with the other. Portraits of Roman Emperors hang on the wall behind them but the only one that has not been defaced is Nero&rsquo;s. This is perhaps hard for a modern audience to identify but there would have been a significant number of Hogarth&rsquo;s classically educated audience who got the gag: Nero was a corrupt womaniser who fiercely persecuted Christians.

"<h3>A Decadant Decline&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom&rsquo;s decadent lifestyle does not last for long and by the third scene his sedan chair is intercepted by bailiffs as he is en route to the Queen&rsquo;s birthday party. It is at this point that our heroine Sarah Young comes to the rescue. She is now working as a milliner and kindly pays Tom&rsquo;s bail. Although Sarah has saved Tom from the bailiffs, she cannot save him from himself. By the next scene he is marrying a wealthy old hag. The old woman&rsquo;s eyes lust eagerly towards the ring and Tom&rsquo;s towards her maid. In the background Sarah Young and her mother struggle to voice their objections but are held back by some of the guests.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom is wealthy again but he is no better with his money now than he was last time and soon he is on his knees in a gambling den having just squandered the lot (see <em>&quot;The Gaming House,&quot;</em> below). Excessive gambling was a real problem in the eighteenth century and whole family fortunes could be lost in one evening. Later in the century, George III&rsquo;s son, who later became George IV, had to ask Parliament for money to help him pay off his gambling debts. It was given to him but it was not long before he needed even more.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Debtors&#39; Prison</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like so many others in eighteenth-century Britain, Tom finds himself in debtors&rsquo;&nbsp;prison, quickly coming to the end of his tether. On the one side his wife derides him for squandering their fortune, on the other the beer-boy and the jailer harass him to settle his weekly bill. Sarah Young, who has come to visit Tom with their child, has fainted on seeing him in this hopeless situation. This must have been very personally relevant for Hogarth as his father spent much of his childhood in a debtors&#39; prison.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>My favourite part of the series is played out in the background of this scene. Tom&rsquo;s fellow inmates are trying various schemes to get enough money to buy their freedom. However, their choice of projects cleverly illustrate just how&nbsp;impossible it was to get out of debt in Georgian Britain. One man is attempting to turn lead into gold while the other is working on solving the national debt crisis. Even Tom has written a play, though&nbsp;we can clearly see a rejection letter for it lying on the table.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Bedlam</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The stresses of the previous scene have proven to be more than Tom can bear and in the final scene he is found languishing in bedlam&mdash;London&rsquo;s notorious mental hospital (see <em>&quot;The Madhouse,&quot;</em> above). The mark on his chest suggests that he has stabbed himself in a failed suicide attempt. Fashionable young women, the likes of which Tom would have socialised with just a short while ago, observe the scene in amusement. All that he has left is the company and care of the faithful Sarah Young.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why so popular?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One answer is that it appealed to the contemporary concern about people from the middle classes who tried to live like aristocrats. This was a popular issue at this time as the merchant trade was creating social mobility on a scale never seen before. However if we scratch the surface of <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> we can see that a number of different types of people implicated. For example, Tom was on his way to the Queen&rsquo;s birthday party when he was stopped by bailiffs and therefore his lifestyle is actually being encouraged and supported by aristocrats. In <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em>, everyone from the Queen to the priest that performs his marriage of convenience, to common prostitutes, &nbsp;are part of the problem.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But it is not just Hogarth&rsquo;s &lsquo;take no prisoners&rsquo; approach to social commentary that made him so popular. Printed satire was actually already very common place and central London was full of bookshops and print sellers that displayed this kind of work. What Hogarth did do that was so completely novel was to tell a story through pictures, <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> is like a story board for a play. In fact, Hogarth&rsquo;s series were adapted into plays and pantomimes during his lifetime. His visual drama offered his audience a new way to enjoy satire. It is for this reason that to find comparisons and inspirations we should be looking at authors such as Hogarth&rsquo;s friend and fellow moraliser, Henry Fielding or Jonathan Swift&mdash;author of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, rather than contemporary artists. The title <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress </em>was referencing John Bunyan&rsquo;s <em>The Pilgrims Progress</em>. We can be quite sure that most people would have gotten this reference as it is thought that, at this time, this was the most read book in Britain after the Bible. Hogarth successfully borrows from popular culture in order to express complicated ideas through an enjoyable and totally accessible story. Of course Hogarth wasn&rsquo;t the first to do this, but he did it so well, he is celebrated to this day.</p>\n"

"<h3>Sex, Booze and 18th-Century Britain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you ever needed proof that the sex, booze and a rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll lifestyle was not a twentieth century invention, you need look no further than the satirical prints of William Hogarth. He held up a moralising mirror to eighteenth-century Britain; the harlots, the womanisers&mdash;even the clergy could not escape. Hogarth&rsquo;s prints play out the sins of eighteenth-century London in a kind of visual theatre that was entirely new and novel in their day.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4eefc3da580ebbc11899b6a2775d4c819854f9c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Harlot&#39;s Progress, plate 1</em>, 1732, etching with engraving on paper,&nbsp;31.4 x 38 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first example of these prints, which Hogarth himself termed &lsquo;modern moral subjects&rsquo;, was <em>A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress</em>. In this series, we meet the fresh faced Moll Hackabout as she arrives for the first time in London. Moll is soon preyed upon by a brothel keeper and she descends into prostitution. The tale ends with her premature death from a sexually transmitted disease, aged just twenty-three. Despite its dark subject matter A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress was a huge success. These prints reference characters types who were well known to their contemporary London audience. For example Moll&rsquo;s madam was the real-life Elizabeth Needham, keeper of an exclusive London brothel and her first patron, the renowned love-rat and convicted rapist, Colonel Francis Charteris.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress&nbsp;</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These sly nods to the bad guys of the day not only made the prints hugely relevant and enjoyable to their target audience but it also made them incredibly popular. <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> (1735) was Hogarth&rsquo;s second series and proved to be just as well loved. The main character is Tom Rakewell&mdash;a rake being a old fashioned term for a man of loose morals or a womaniser. Tom&rsquo;s name is intentionally general and in a modern equivalent, he might be called &lsquo;Mr. Immoral.&rsquo; Tom is not unique, he could be any number of people in eighteenth-century Britain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The series opens with a chaotic scene: Tom&rsquo;s father, who was a rich merchant, has died and Tom has returned from Oxford University to collect and spend his late father&rsquo;s wealth. He also wastes no time in rejecting his pregnant fiance, Sarah Young, by attempting to pay her off. Hogarth laces all his prints with clues to help us decode the scene. Here we can see Sarah sobbing into a hankie whilst holding her engagement ring in her hand. Her mother stands behind her angrily clutching the love letters Tom once wrote to her daughter and he holds out a handful of coins in an attempt to get rid of them. Sarah pops up throughout these prints representing a more wholesome life that he could have had.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>A Fashionable Life</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the next scene (<em>&quot;Surrounded by Artists and Professors,&quot; </em>above) Tom has already moved from his cosy, if slightly shabby family home into his new bachelor pad surrounded by a dance master, a music teacher, a poet, a tailor, a landscape gardener, a body guard and a jockey all offering their services to help Tom complete his fashionable lifestyle. He is dressed in his nightclothes indicating that he has just woken: those who wish to exploit his new found wealth are wasting no time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom&rsquo;s fashionable life also comes with fashionable vices and soon we see him in the Rose Tavern with a group of prostitutes (see <em>&quot;The Tavern Scene,&quot;</em> below). He sits on the lap of one who caresses him with one hand whilst robbing him of his watch with the other. Portraits of Roman Emperors hang on the wall behind them but the only one that has not been defaced is Nero&rsquo;s. This is perhaps hard for a modern audience to identify but there would have been a significant number of Hogarth&rsquo;s classically educated audience who got the gag: Nero was a corrupt womaniser who fiercely persecuted Christians. To the very classically aware Georgians (George II was then King) the message was clear, Christian morals are not to be found here.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Biggest and the Highest</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are so many superlatives consorting with the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Salisbury: it has the tallest spire in Britain (404 feet); it houses the best preserved of the four surviving original copies of the Magna Carta (1215); it has the oldest working clock in Europe (1386); it has the largest cathedral cloisters and cathedral close in Britain; the choir (or quire) stalls are the largest and earliest complete set in Britain; the vault is the highest in&nbsp;Britain. Bigger, better, best&mdash;and built in a mere 38 years, roughly from 1220 to 1258, which is a pretty short construction schedule for a large stone building made without motorized equipment.</p>\n"
"\n"

"<p>One factor that enabled Salisbury Cathedral to become so extraordinary is that it was the first major cathedral to be built on an unobstructed site. The architect and clerics were able to conceive a design and lay it out exactly as they wanted. Construction was carried out in one campaign, giving the complex a cohesive motif and singular identity.

Pointed arches and lancet shapes are everywhere, from the prominent west windows to the painted arches of the east end. The narrow piers of the cathedral were made of cut stone rather than rubble-filled drums, as in earlier buildings, which changed the method of distributing the structure&rsquo;s weight and allowed for more light in the interior. The piers are decorated with slender columns of dark gray Purbeck marble, which reappear in clusters and as stand-alone supports in the arches of the triforium, clerestory, and cloisters. The triforium and cloisters repeat the same patterns of plate tracery &ndash; basically stone cut-out shapes &ndash; of quatrefoils, cinquefoils, even hexafoils and octofoils. Proportions are uniform throughout.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One deviation from the typical Gothic style is the way the lower arcade level of the nave is cut off by a string course that runs between it and the triforium. In most churches of this period, the columns or piers stretch upwards in one form or another all the way to the ceiling or vault. Here at Salisbury the arcade is merely an arcade, and the effect is more like a layer cake with the upper tiers sitting on top of rather than extending from the lower level.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Tower and the Spire</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The original design called for a fairly ordinary square crossing tower of modest height. But in the early part of the 14th century, two stories were added to the tower, and then the pointed spire was added in 1330. The spire is the most readily identified feature of the cathedral and is visible for miles. However, the addition of this landmark tower and spire added over 6,000 tons of weight to the supporting structure. Because the building had not been engineered to carry the extra weight, additional buttressing was required internally and externally. The transepts now sport masonry girders, or strainer arches, to support the weight. Not surprisingly, the spire has never been straight and now tilts to the southeast by about 27 inches.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Restorations</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Over the centuries the cathedral has been subject to well-intentioned, but heavy-handed restorations by later architects such as James Wyatt and Sir George Gilbert Scott, who tried to conform the building to contemporary tastes. Therefore, the interior has lost some of its original decoration and furnishings, including stained glass and small chapels, and new things have been added. This is pretty typical, though, of a building that is several centuries old. Fortunately, the regularity and clean lines of the cathedral have not been tampered with. It is still refined, polished, and generally easy on the eye.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Sunlight</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although it inspires the usual awe felt in such a grand and substantial building, and is as pretty as a wedding cake, it has had some criticism from art historians: Nikolaus Pevsner and Harry Batsford both disliked the west front, with its encrustation of statues and &ldquo;variegated pettiness&rdquo; (Batsford). John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic and writer, found the building &ldquo;profound and gloomy.&rdquo; Indeed, in gray weather, the monochromatic scheme of Chilmark stone and Purbeck marble is just gray upon gray. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/33fe75aa21925f0c1ab5d47e33cf722789fce827.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">West front of Salisbury Cathedral, 1220-1320&nbsp;(photo: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral#mediaviewer/File:Salisbury_Cathedral_WestFront.jpg\">Raggatt2000</a>)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The pictures in this video, however, show the widely changing character of the neutral tones; sunlight transforms the building, and the visitor&#39;s experience of it. This very quality is what made the Gothic style so revolutionary &ndash; the ability to get sunlight into a large building with massive stone walls. Windows are everywhere, and when the light streams through the clerestory arches and the enormous west window, the interior turns from drear gray to transcendent gold. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n"

The triforium and cloisters repeat the same patterns of plate tracery &ndash; basically stone cut-out shapes &ndash; of quatrefoils, cinquefoils, even hexafoils and octofoils. Proportions are uniform throughout.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One deviation from the typical Gothic style is the way the lower arcade level of the nave is cut off by a string course that runs between it and the triforium. In most churches of this period, the columns or piers stretch upwards in one form or another all the way to the ceiling or vault. Here at Salisbury the arcade is merely an arcade, and the effect is more like a layer cake with the upper tiers sitting on top of rather than extending from the lower level.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Tower and the Spire</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The original design called for a fairly ordinary square crossing tower of modest height. But in the early part of the 14th century, two stories were added to the tower, and then the pointed spire was added in 1330. The spire is the most readily identified feature of the cathedral and is visible for miles. However, the addition of this landmark tower and spire added over 6,000 tons of weight to the supporting structure. Because the building had not been engineered to carry the extra weight, additional buttressing was required internally and externally. The transepts now sport masonry girders, or strainer arches, to support the weight. Not surprisingly, the spire has never been straight and now tilts to the southeast by about 27 inches.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Restorations</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Over the centuries the cathedral has been subject to well-intentioned, but heavy-handed restorations by later architects such as James Wyatt and Sir George Gilbert Scott, who tried to conform the building to contemporary tastes. Therefore, the interior has lost some of its original decoration and furnishings, including stained glass and small chapels, and new things have been added. This is pretty typical, though, of a building that is several centuries old. Fortunately, the regularity and clean lines of the cathedral have not been tampered with. It is still refined, polished, and generally easy on the eye.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Sunlight</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although it inspires the usual awe felt in such a grand and substantial building, and is as pretty as a wedding cake, it has had some criticism from art historians: Nikolaus Pevsner and Harry Batsford both disliked the west front, with its encrustation of statues and &ldquo;variegated pettiness&rdquo; (Batsford). John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic and writer, found the building &ldquo;profound and gloomy.&rdquo; Indeed, in gray weather, the monochromatic scheme of Chilmark stone and Purbeck marble is just gray upon gray. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/33fe75aa21925f0c1ab5d47e33cf722789fce827.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">West front of Salisbury Cathedral, 1220-1320&nbsp;(photo: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral#mediaviewer/File:Salisbury_Cathedral_WestFront.jpg\">Raggatt2000</a>)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The pictures in this video, however, show the widely changing character of the neutral tones; sunlight transforms the building, and the visitor&#39;s experience of it. This very quality is what made the Gothic style so revolutionary &ndash; the ability to get sunlight into a large building with massive stone walls. Windows are everywhere, and when the light streams through the clerestory arches and the enormous west window, the interior turns from drear gray to transcendent gold. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The city of Ur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Known today as Tell el-Muqayyar, the &quot;Mound of Pitch,&quot; the site was occupied from around 5000 B.C.E. to 300 B.C.E. Although Ur is famous as the home of the Old Testament patriarch Abraham (Genesis 11:29-32), there is no actual proof that Tell el-Muqayyar was identical with &quot;Ur of the Chaldees.&quot; In antiquity the city was known as Urim.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"

At the center of the settlement were mud brick temples dating back to the fourth millennium B.C.E.&nbsp;At the edge of the sacred area a cemetery grew up which included burials known today as the Royal Graves. An area of ordinary people&#39;s houses was excavated in which a number of street corners have small shrines. But the largest surviving religious buildings, dedicated to the moon god Nanna, also include one of the best preserved ziggurats, and were founded in the period 2100-1800 B.C.E. For some of this time Ur was the capital of an empire stretching across southern Mesopotamia. Rulers of the later Kassite and Neo-Babylonian empires continued to build and rebuild at Ur. Changes in both the flow of the River Euphrates (now some ten miles to the east) and trade routes led to the eventual abandonment of the site.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The royal graves of Ur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Close to temple buildings at the center of the city of Ur, sat&nbsp;a rubbish dump built up over centuries. Unable to use the area for building, the people of Ur started to bury their dead there. The cemetery was used between about 2600-2000 B.C.E. and hundreds of burials were made in pits. Many of these contained very rich materials.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In one area of the cemetery a group of sixteen graves was dated to the mid-third millennium. These large, shaft graves were distinct from the surrounding burials and consisted of a tomb, made of stone, rubble and bricks, built at the bottom of a pit. The layout of the tombs varied, some occupied the entire floor of the pit and had multiple chambers. The most complete tomb discovered belonged to a lady identified as Pu-abi from the name carved on a cylinder seal found with the burial.<br />\n"

The excavator, Leonard Woolley thought the graves belonged to kings and queens. Another suggestion is that they belonged to the high priestesses of Ur.</p>\n"

"<p>Transformation masks, like those belonging to the Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw (pronounced Kwak-wak-ah-wak, a Pacific Northwest Coast indigenous people) and illustrated here, are&nbsp;worn during a potlatch,&nbsp;a ceremony where the host displayed his status, in part by giving away gifts to those in attendance. These masks&nbsp;were only one part of a costume that also included a cloak made of red cedar bark. During a potlatch, Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw dancers perform wearing the mask&nbsp;and costume. The masks conveyed&nbsp;social position (only those with a certain status could wear them)&nbsp;and also helped to portray a family&rsquo;s genealogy by displaying&nbsp;(family) crest&nbsp;symbols.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masks are not the same across the First Nations of the Northwest Coastal areas; here we focus solely on Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw transformation masks.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw (&ldquo;Kwak&rsquo;wala speaking tribes&rdquo;) are generally called Kwakiutl by non-Native peoples. They are one of many indigenous groups that live on the western coast of British Columbia, Canada. The mythology and cosmology of different Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw Nations (such as the Kwagu&rsquo;ł (Kwakiutl) or &lsquo;Namgis) is extremely diverse, although&nbsp;there are commonalities. For instance, many groups relate that deceased ancestors roamed the world, transforming themselves in the process (this might entail removing their animal skins or masks to reveal their human selves within).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw bands are arranged into four clans (Killer Whale, Eagle, Raven, and Wolf clans). The clans are divided into <em>numayn</em> (or <em>&lsquo;na&rsquo;mina</em>), which can be loosely translated as &ldquo;group of fellows of the same kind&rdquo; (essentially groups that shared a common ancestor). <em>Numayns</em> were responsible for safe-guarding crest&nbsp;symbols and for conveying their specific rights&mdash;which might include access to natural resources (like salmon fishing areas) and rights to sacred names and dances that related to a <em>numayn&rsquo;s</em> ancestor or the group&rsquo;s origins. The <em>numayn</em> were ranked, and typically only one person could fill a spot at any given moment in time. Each rank entailed specific rights, including ceremonial privileges&mdash;like the right to wear a mask such as the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s Thunderbird transformation mask. Animal transformation masks contained crests for a given <em>numayn</em>. Ancestral entities and supernatural forces temporarily embody dancers wearing these masks and other ceremonial regalia.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Many myths relate moments of transformation often involving trickster supernaturals (a trickster is a god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphic animal who exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behavior). Raven, for instance, is known as a consummate trickster&mdash;he often changes into other creatures, and helps&nbsp;humans by providing them with a variety of useful&nbsp;things such as&nbsp;the sun, moon, fire, and salmon.&nbsp;Thunderbird (<em>Kwankwanxwalige&rsquo;</em>), who was a mythical ancestor of the Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw, also figures prominently in mythology. He is believed to cause thunder when he beats his wings, and&nbsp;lightning comes from his eyes. He lives in the celestial realm, and he can remove his bird skin to assume human form.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Design and materials</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The masks illustrated here display a variety of brightly colored surfaces filled with complex forms. These&nbsp;masks use elements of the formline style, a term coined&nbsp;in 1965 to describe the characteristics of Northwest Coast visual culture. The Brooklyn Museum mask provides a clear example of what constitutes the formline style. For instance, The Brooklyn Museum mask (when open) displays a color palette of mostly red, blue-green, and black, which is consistent with other formline objects like a Tlingit Raven Screen (a house partition screen) attributed to Kadyisdu.axch&rsquo; (detail below). The masks, whether opened or closed, are bilaterally symmetrical. Typical of the formline style is the use of an undulating, calligraphic line. Also, note how the pupils of the eyes on the exterior of the Brooklyn Museum mask&nbsp;are ovoid shapes, similar to the figures and forms found on the interior surfaces of many masks. This ovoid shape, along with s- and u-forms, are common&nbsp;features of the formline style. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The American Museum of Natural History and Brooklyn Museum masks are carved of red cedar wood, an important and common material used for many Northwest Coast objects and buildings. Masks take months, sometimes years, to create. Because they are made of wood and other organic materials that quickly decay, most masks date to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (even though we know that the practice extends much farther into the past). In fact, the artistic style of many transformation masks it thought to have emerged over a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>With the introduction and enforcement of Christianity and as a result of colonization in the nineteenth century, masking practices changed among peoples of the Northwest Coast. Prior to contact with Russians, Europeans, and Euro-Americans, masks like the Brooklyn Museums&rsquo;s Thunderbird Transformation Mask, were not carved using metal tools. After iron tools were introduced along with other materials and equipment, masks demonstrate different carving techniques. Earlier masks used natural (plant and mineral based) pigments, post-contact,&nbsp;brighter and more durable synthetic colors were introduced. The open mask from the American Museum of Natural History, for example, displays bright red, yellow, and blue.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ceremonies and potlatches&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masks passed between family members of a specific clan (they could be inherited or gifted). They were just&nbsp;one sign of a person&rsquo;s status and rank, which were important to demonstrate within Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw society&mdash;especially during a potlatch. Franz Boas, an anthropologist who worked in this area between 1885 and 1930, noted that &ldquo;The acquisition of a high position and the maintenance of its dignity require correct marriages and wealth&mdash;wealth accumulated by industry and by loaning out property at interest&mdash;dissipated at the proper time, albeit with the understanding that each recipient of a gift has to return it with interest at a time when he is dissipating his wealth. This is the general principle underlying the potlatch&hellip;.&rdquo;[1]&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Potlatches were banned in 1885 until the 1950s because they were considered immoral&nbsp;by Christian missionaries who believed cannibalism occurred&nbsp;(for its part, the Canadian Government thought potlatches&nbsp;hindered&nbsp;economic development&nbsp;because people ceased&nbsp;work during these ritual celebrations). With the prohibition of potlatches, many masks were confiscated. Those that weren&rsquo;t destroyed often made their way into museums or private collections. When the ban against potlatches was removed by the Canadian government, many First Nations have attempted to regain possession of the masks and other objects that had been taken from them. Potlatches are still practiced today among Northwest Coast peoples.</span></p>\n"

The Brooklyn Museum mask provides a clear example of what constitutes the formline style. For instance, The Brooklyn Museum mask (when open) displays a color palette of mostly red, blue-green, and black, which is consistent with other formline objects like a Tlingit Raven Screen (a house partition screen) attributed to Kadyisdu.axch&rsquo; (detail below). The masks, whether opened or closed, are bilaterally symmetrical. Typical of the formline style is the use of an undulating, calligraphic line. Also, note how the pupils of the eyes on the exterior of the Brooklyn Museum mask&nbsp;are ovoid shapes, similar to the figures and forms found on the interior surfaces of many masks. This ovoid shape, along with s- and u-forms, are common&nbsp;features of the formline style. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The American Museum of Natural History and Brooklyn Museum masks are carved of red cedar wood, an important and common material used for many Northwest Coast objects and buildings. Masks take months, sometimes years, to create. Because they are made of wood and other organic materials that quickly decay, most masks date to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (even though we know that the practice extends much farther into the past). In fact, the artistic style of many transformation masks it thought to have emerged over a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>With the introduction and enforcement of Christianity and as a result of colonization in the nineteenth century, masking practices changed among peoples of the Northwest Coast. Prior to contact with Russians, Europeans, and Euro-Americans, masks like the Brooklyn Museums&rsquo;s Thunderbird Transformation Mask, were not carved using metal tools. After iron tools were introduced along with other materials and equipment, masks demonstrate different carving techniques. Earlier masks used natural (plant and mineral based) pigments, post-contact,&nbsp;brighter and more durable synthetic colors were introduced. The open mask from the American Museum of Natural History, for example, displays bright red, yellow, and blue.</p>\n"

"<h3>Ceremonies and potlatches&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masks passed between family members of a specific clan (they could be inherited or gifted). They were just&nbsp;one sign of a person&rsquo;s status and rank, which were important to demonstrate within Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw society&mdash;especially during a potlatch. Franz Boas, an anthropologist who worked in this area between 1885 and 1930, noted that &ldquo;The acquisition of a high position and the maintenance of its dignity require correct marriages and wealth&mdash;wealth accumulated by industry and by loaning out property at interest&mdash;dissipated at the proper time, albeit with the understanding that each recipient of a gift has to return it with interest at a time when he is dissipating his wealth. This is the general principle underlying the potlatch&hellip;.&rdquo;[1]&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Potlatches were banned in 1885 until the 1950s because they were considered immoral&nbsp;by Christian missionaries who believed cannibalism occurred&nbsp;(for its part, the Canadian Government thought potlatches&nbsp;hindered&nbsp;economic development&nbsp;because people ceased&nbsp;work during these ritual celebrations). With the prohibition of potlatches, many masks were confiscated. Those that weren&rsquo;t destroyed often made their way into museums or private collections. When the ban against potlatches was removed by the Canadian government, many First Nations have attempted to regain possession of the masks and other objects that had been taken from them. Potlatches are still practiced today among Northwest Coast peoples.</span></p>\n"

"<h3><span>After <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em></span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the end of 1821 the leading Romantic painter in France, Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, returned from a year long stay in England where crowds had flocked to see his masterpiece <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em> displayed in the Egyptian Hall in Pall Mall, London. Despite the success of the exhibition, the French government still refused to buy the painting and his own prodigious spending meant that he was strapped for cash and in no position to embark on another ambitious and expensive large scale project like The Raft. His health too was soon to suffer. On his return to France, a riding accident led to complications, causing a tumor to develop on the spine that proved fatal. He died, aged 32, in January 1824.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f20d063f697a43fb0b0d729114775d848e3583f3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>A Woman Addicted to Gambling</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 77 x 64 cm (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of his last years were his portraits of the insane. There were ten of them originally. Only five have survived: <em>A Woman Addicted to Gambling</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Child Snatcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Kleptomaniac</em>; and&nbsp;<em>A Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Command</em>. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>No information is available for those that have been lost. According to the artist&rsquo;s first biographer, Charles Cl&eacute;ment, G&eacute;ricault painted them after returning from England for &Eacute;tienne-Jean Georget (1795-1828), the chief physician of the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, the women&rsquo;s asylum in Paris. The paintings were certainly in Georget&rsquo;s possession when he died.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Three Theories for the Commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How the two men met is not known for sure. Possibly Georget treated G&eacute;ricault as a patient, or perhaps they met in the Beaujon Hospital, from whose morgue G&eacute;ricault had taken home dissected limbs to serve as studies for his figures in The Raft. What is more debated though, is Georget&rsquo;s role in the production of the paintings. There are three main theories. The first two link the portraits to the psychological toll taken out of G&eacute;ricault whilst producing his great masterpiece and the nervous breakdown he is believed to have suffered in the autumn following its completion in 1819. The first theory runs that Georget helped him to recover from this episode and that the portraits were produced for and given to the doctor as a gesture of thanks; the second puts forward that Georget, as the artist&rsquo;s physician, encouraged G&eacute;ricault to paint them as an early form of art therapy; and the third is that G&eacute;ricault painted them for Georget after his return from England to assist his studies in mental illness.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is this last that is generally held to be the most likely. Stylistically, they belong to the period after his stay in England, two years after his breakdown. Also, the unified nature of the series, in terms of their scale, composition and color scheme suggest a clearly defined commission, while the medical concept of &ldquo;monomania&rdquo; shapes the whole design.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Early Modern Psychiatry</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A key figure in early modern psychiatry in France was Jean-Etienne-Dominique Esquirol (1772-1840), whose main area of interest was &ldquo;monomania,&rdquo; a term no longer in clinical use, which described a particular fixation leading sufferers to exhibit delusional behavior, imagining themselves to be a king, for example. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/528d22d27c06d93d134d282dab4f4582ce5b0d86.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault,<em> Portait of a Child Snatcher,</em> 1822, oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm (Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield, Massachusetts)</span></span>Esquirol, who shared a house with his friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Georget, was a great believer in the now largely discredited science of physiognomy, holding that physical appearances could be used to diagnose mental disorders. With this in mind, he had over 200 drawings made of his patients, a group of which, executed by Georges-Francoise Gabriel, were exhibited at the Salon of 1814. As an exhibitor himself that year, it seems highly likely that G&eacute;ricault would have seen them there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Georget&rsquo;s work developed on Esquirol&rsquo;s. &nbsp;An Enlightenment figure, Esquirol rejected moral or theological explanations for mental illness, seeing insanity, neither as the workings of the devil nor as the outcome of moral decrepitude, but as an organic affliction, one that, like any other disease, can be identified by observable physical symptoms. In his book <em>On Madness</em>, published in 1820, following Esquirol, Georget turns to physiognomy to support this theory:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>In general the idiot&rsquo;s face is stupid, without meaning; the face of the manic patient is as agitated as his spirit, often distorted and cramped; the moron&rsquo;s facial characteristics are dejected and without expression; the facial characteristics of the melancholic are pinched, marked by pain or extreme agitation; the monomaniacal king has a proud, inflated expression; the religious fanatic is mild, he exhorts by casting his eyes at the heavens or fixing them on the earth; the anxious patient pleads, glancing sideways, etc.</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The clumsy language here&mdash;&ldquo;the idiot&rsquo;s face is stupid&rdquo;&mdash;seems a world away from G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s extraordinarily sensitive paintings, a point that begs the question whether G&eacute;ricault was doing more than simply following the good doctor&rsquo;s orders in producing the series, but instead making his own independent enquiries.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6c61cfc6bf1185ca13f02e4bf676e234b74a5317.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>Portait of a Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy (The Hyena)</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 72 x 58 cm (Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, Lyons)</span></span>G&eacute;ricault had many reasons to be interested in psychiatry, starting with his own family: his grandfather and one of his uncles had died insane. His experiences while painting <em>The Raft </em>must also have left their mark. The Medusa&rsquo;s surgeon, J.B. Henry Savigny, at the time G&eacute;ricault interviewed him, was writing an account of the psychological impact the experience had had on his fellow passengers and, of course, there was G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s own mental breakdown in 1819. It seems only natural then that he would be drawn to this new and exciting area of scientific study.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Alternatively, some critics argue that G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s work is a propaganda exercise for Georget, designed to demonstrate the importance of psychiatrists in detecting signs of mental illness. In their very subtleties they show just how difficult this can be, requiring a trained eye such as Georget&rsquo;s to come to the correct diagnosis. According to Albert Boime, the paintings were also used to demonstrate the curative effects of psychiatric treatment. If the five missing paintings were ever found, he argues, they would depict the same characters&mdash;but after treatment&mdash;showing their improved state, much like &lsquo;before and after&rsquo; photographs in modern day advertising.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This, of course, is impossible to prove or disprove. What is more challenging is Boime&rsquo;s general criticisms of early psychiatry which, he argues, by classifying, containing and observing people was effective only in silencing the voices of the mentally ill, rendering them invisible and therefore subject to abuse. The fact that the sitters of the paintings are given no names, but are defined only by their illnesses would seem to confirm this view and, for that reason, many modern viewers of the paintings do feel disconcerted when looking at them.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>The Portraits</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>​The five surviving portraits are bust length and in front view, without hands.&nbsp;The canvases vary in dimensions but the heads are all close to life-size.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3e5237809c7828b9f81856d8e776a734e087f8a4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>Portrait of a Kleptomaniac</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 61 x 50 cm (Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent)</span></span>The viewpoint is at eye level for the three men but from above for the women, indicating that the paintings were executed in different places.&nbsp;It seems likely that the women were painted in the women&rsquo;s hospital Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, while the men were selected from among the inmates of Charenton and Bicȇtre. &nbsp;None of the sitters is named; they are identified by their malady. None look directly at the viewer, contributing to an uneasy sense of distractedness in their gazes that can be read as stillness, as though they are lost in their own thoughts, or as disconnectedness from the process in which they are involved. These are not patrons and have had no say in how they are depicted.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each is shown in three-quarter profile, some to the left, some to the right. The pose is typical of formal, honorific portraits, effecting a restrained composition that does not make it apparent that they are confined in asylums. There is no evidence of the setting in the backgrounds either, which are cast in shadow, as are most of their bodies, drawing the focus largely on their faces.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9286354ca86163fdd2edd4de1bb38c725452ba7d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>Portrait of a Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Command</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 81 x 65 cm (Sammlung Oskar Reinhart, Winterthur)</span></span>The dark coloring creates a sombre atmosphere, evocative of brooding introspection.&nbsp;Their clothing lends them a degree of personal dignity, giving no indication as to the nature of their conditions, the one exception being the man suffering from delusions of military grandeur who wears a medallion on his chest, a tasseled hat and a cloak over one shoulder, which point to his delusions. The medallion has no shine to it and the string that it hangs from looks makeshift and worn.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The paintings were executed with great speed, entirely from life and probably in one sitting. &nbsp;Critics often remark on the painterly quality of the work, the extraordinary fluency of brushwork, in contrast with G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s early more sculptural style, suggesting that the erratic brushwork is used to mirror the disordered thoughts of the patients. In places it is applied in almost translucent layers, while in others it is thicker creating highly expressive contrasts in textures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Romantic Scientists</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What perhaps strikes one most about the portraits is the extraordinary empathy we are made to feel for these poor souls, who might not strike us immediately as insane, but who certainly exhibit outward signs of inward suffering.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/29254bf217f00cad67131eeb7e9f56b97a82a7be.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">John Constable, Cloud Study, 1822, oil on paper laid on board, 47.6 x 57.5 cm (Tate Britain)&nbsp;</span></span>In bringing the sensitivity of a great artist to assist scientific enquiry, G&eacute;ricault was not alone among Romantic painters. John Constable&rsquo;s cloud studies, for example, were exactly contemporary with the portraits and provide an interesting parallel. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Both artists capture brilliantly the fleeting moment, the shifting movements in Constable&rsquo;s cumulus, stratus, cirrus and nimbus, in G&eacute;ricault the complex play of emotions on the faces of the insane.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Not since the Renaissance has art illustrated so beautifully the concerns of the scientific domain; in G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s case teaching those early psychiatrists, we might be tempted to think, to look on their patients with a more human gaze.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Alternatively, some critics argue that G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s work is a propaganda exercise for Georget, designed to demonstrate the importance of psychiatrists in detecting signs of mental illness. In their very subtleties they show just how difficult this can be, requiring a trained eye such as Georget&rsquo;s to come to the correct diagnosis. According to Albert Boime, the paintings were also used to demonstrate the curative effects of psychiatric treatment. If the five missing paintings were ever found, he argues, they would depict the same characters&mdash;but after treatment&mdash;showing their improved state, much like &lsquo;before and after&rsquo; photographs in modern day advertising.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This, of course, is impossible to prove or disprove. What is more challenging is Boime&rsquo;s general criticisms of early psychiatry which, he argues, by classifying, containing and observing people was effective only in silencing the voices of the mentally ill, rendering them invisible and therefore subject to abuse. The fact that the sitters of the paintings are given no names, but are defined only by their illnesses would seem to confirm this view and, for that reason, many modern viewers of the paintings do feel disconcerted when looking at them.&nbsp;</p>\n"

None look directly at the viewer, contributing to an uneasy sense of distractedness in their gazes that can be read as stillness, as though they are lost in their own thoughts, or as disconnectedness from the process in which they are involved. These are not patrons and have had no say in how they are depicted.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The medallion has no shine to it and the string that it hangs from looks makeshift and worn.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The paintings were executed with great speed, entirely from life and probably in one sitting. &nbsp;Critics often remark on the painterly quality of the work, the extraordinary fluency of brushwork, in contrast with G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s early more sculptural style, suggesting that the erratic brushwork is used to mirror the disordered thoughts of the patients. In places it is applied in almost translucent layers, while in others it is thicker creating highly expressive contrasts in textures.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Pilgrims arriving in Conques had one thing on their mind: the reliquary of Saint Foy. This reliquary, or container holding the remains of a saint or holy person, was one of the most famous in all of Europe. So famous that it was originally located in a monastery in Agen but the monks at Conques plotted to steal it in order to attract more wealth and visitors. The reliquary at Conques held the remains of Saint Foy, a young Christian convert living in Roman-occupied France during the second century. At the age of twelve, she was condemned to die for her refusal to sacrifice to pagan gods, she is therefore revered&nbsp;as a martyr, as&nbsp;someone who dies for their faith. Saint Foy was a very popular saint in Southern France&nbsp;and her relic&nbsp;was extremely important to&nbsp;the church;&nbsp;bringing pilgrams and wealth to the small, isolated town of Conques.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the date of the reliquary is unknown, Bernard of Angers first spoke it about in 1010. At first, Bernard was frightened that the statue was too beautiful stating, &quot;Brother, what do you think of this idol? Would Jupiter or Mars consider himself unworthy of such a statue?&quot; He was concerned about idolatry&mdash;that pilgrims would begin to worship the jewel-encrusted reliquary rather than what that reliquary contained and represented, the holy figure of Saint Foy. Indeed, the gold and gem encrusted statue would been&nbsp;quite a sight for the pilgrims.&nbsp;Over time, travelers paid homage to Saint Foy by donating&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33 1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: Holly Hayes (CC BY-NC 2.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7598d1c8c3349dc7e3715d46fe699a481d8c44f6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33-1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sacred_destinations/2649842024/in/photostream/\">Holly Hayes </a>(CC BY-NC 2.0)</span></span>gemstones for the reliquary so that her dress is&nbsp;covered with agates, amethysts, crystals, carnelians, emeralds, garnets, hematite, jade, onyx, opals, pearls, rubies, sapphires, topazes, antique cameos and intaglios. Her face, which stares boldly at the viewer, is thought to have originally been the head of a Roman statue of a child. The reuse of older materials in new forms of art is known as spolia. Using spolia was not only practical but it made the object more important by associating it with the past riches of the Roman Empire.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Church of Saint Foy at Conques provides an excellent example of Romanesque art and architecture. Although the monastery no longer survives, the church and treasury stand as a reminder of&nbsp;the rituals of medieval faith, especially for pilgrims. Even today, people make the long trek to Conques to pay respect to Saint Foy. Every October, a great celebration and procession is held for Saint Foy, continuing a medieval tradition into present day devotion.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>When a pilgrim arrived at Conques, they would probably head for the church to receive blessing. Yet before they got inside, an important message awaited them on the portals: the Last Judgment.

"<p>In the center sits Christ as Judge, and he means business! He sits enthroned with his right hand pointing upwards to the saved while his left hand gestures down to the damned.

"\n"
"<p>Pilgrims arriving in Conques had one thing on their mind: the reliquary of Saint Foy. This reliquary, or container holding the remains of a saint or holy person, was one of the most famous in all of Europe. So famous that it was originally located in a monastery in Agen but the monks at Conques plotted to steal it in order to attract more wealth and visitors. The reliquary at Conques held the remains of Saint Foy, a young Christian convert living in Roman-occupied France during the second century. At the age of twelve, she was condemned to die for her refusal to sacrifice to pagan gods, she is therefore revered&nbsp;as a martyr, as&nbsp;someone who dies for their faith. Saint Foy was a very popular saint in Southern France&nbsp;and her relic&nbsp;was extremely important to&nbsp;the church;&nbsp;bringing pilgrams and wealth to the small, isolated town of Conques.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the date of the reliquary is unknown, Bernard of Angers first spoke it about in 1010. At first, Bernard was frightened that the statue was too beautiful stating, &quot;Brother, what do you think of this idol? Would Jupiter or Mars consider himself unworthy of such a statue?&quot; He was concerned about idolatry&mdash;that pilgrims would begin to worship the jewel-encrusted reliquary rather than what that reliquary contained and represented, the holy figure of Saint Foy. Indeed, the gold and gem encrusted statue would been&nbsp;quite a sight for the pilgrims.&nbsp;Over time, travelers paid homage to Saint Foy by donating&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33 1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: Holly Hayes (CC BY-NC 2.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7598d1c8c3349dc7e3715d46fe699a481d8c44f6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33-1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sacred_destinations/2649842024/in/photostream/\">Holly Hayes </a>(CC BY-NC 2.0)</span></span>gemstones for the reliquary so that her dress is&nbsp;covered with agates, amethysts, crystals, carnelians, emeralds, garnets, hematite, jade, onyx, opals, pearls, rubies, sapphires, topazes, antique cameos and intaglios. Her face, which stares boldly at the viewer, is thought to have originally been the head of a Roman statue of a child. The reuse of older materials in new forms of art is known as spolia. Using spolia was not only practical but it made the object more important by associating it with the past riches of the Roman Empire.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Church of Saint Foy at Conques provides an excellent example of Romanesque art and architecture. Although the monastery no longer survives, the church and treasury stand as a reminder of&nbsp;the rituals of medieval faith, especially for pilgrims. Even today, people make the long trek to Conques to pay respect to Saint Foy. Every October, a great celebration and procession is held for Saint Foy, continuing a medieval tradition into present day devotion.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>A Brief Introduction to WWI and Its Representation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When shots rang out in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, Europe began hurtling towards one of the deadliest conflicts the world has ever seen. Gavrilo Princip&rsquo;s assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, brought long-brewing political tension to a head. By August 4, 1914, the Central Powers (Germany, Bulgaria, Austro-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Entente or Allied Powers (France, Britain, Russia, Italy, and later the United States), were officially engaged in the First World War.</p>\n"

However, like wars throughout history, it inspired a tremendous amount of creative output from artists and writers, civilians and combatants, men and women. Though we may read about dates and numbers when we study historic conflicts, the lived reality of a war becomes much more vivid when we look at the diverse creative expressions it inspires. The varied perspectives represented in the First World War art show us that there was not one single uniform war experience for Britons, whether on the battlefield or at home. In fact, we could say that British artists and writers witnessed and experienced different wars even though only one conflict is recorded in history. War-related art also had many purposes, whether to document, commemorate, appeal, revise, expose, obscure, or protest.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Conflict Between Real and Ideal</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Propaganda posters often urged men to enlist in the British Army by appealing to ideals of masculinity, heroism, pride, and loyalty. These widely circulated posters relied on a viewer&rsquo;s positive response to imagery of healthy, stalwart soldiers or emblems of the British nation. A propaganda poster asks its viewer to identify with what is depicted, which usually concerns political, gender, and/or social identity. As part of making such an appeal, propagandists often obscure more realistic aspects of combat or service.</p>\n"

For example, when we look at C.R.W. Nevinson&rsquo;s stark painting, <em>Paths of Glory</em>, irony comes to the forefont. Though the piece has an idealistic-sounding title, we shudder at the sight of two dead soldiers lying in the battlefield mud. We cannot identify with, or even identify these soldiers at all. Their faces are obscured and their bodies merge with the murky earth, suggesting the loss of identity and the waste of young lives. The brownish grey mud almost threatens to rise up and swallow the entire scene.</p>\n"

Here is chaos, irrevocable change, and devastation.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Carrying poetry to war</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>First World War literature also presents a range of perspectives. Rupert Brooke&rsquo;s patriotic &lsquo;1914&rsquo; sonnet sequence became hugely popular in the early years of the war. At the outset of the war, many Britons were touched by the heroic sentiments of the poems, in particular, &ldquo;The Soldier.&rdquo; This poem&rsquo;s combatant speaker assures the reader that his death in battle will mean that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some corner of a foreign field/That is for ever England.&rdquo; Brooke&rsquo;s poems pictured military service and death as purifying and noble. At the start of the war, when such nationalistic feeling was strong, many British soldiers departed for training with a copy of Brooke&rsquo;s poems tucked into their kits. However, after years of devastating losses and with no clear resolution to the seemingly endless fighting, poets depicting the hard reality of the soldier&rsquo;s experience gained more recognition. Wilfred Owen&rsquo;s gloomy 1917 &ldquo;Anthem for Doomed Youth&rdquo; pictures the war&rsquo;s fallen &ldquo;d[ying] as cattle,&rdquo; for example. Siegfried Sassoon&rsquo;s 1918 piece, &ldquo;Counter-Attack,&rdquo; offers us the gruesome vision of a battlefield &ldquo;place rotten with dead&rdquo; where corpses &ldquo;face downward, in the sucking mud,/Wallow&hellip;&rdquo; Sassoon&rsquo;s shocking verbal image recalls the horrible tableau of Nevinson&rsquo;s dead soldiers lying facedown in the mud.</p>\n"

"<h3>A Note on WWI and Modernism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mark Gertler, Merry-Go-Round, 1916,oil on canvas, 189.2 x 142.2 cm (Tate)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/107f1de96b16eb969b372643c77f9fb37c669328.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Mark Gertler, Merry-Go-Round, 1916,oil on canvas, 189.2 x 142.2 cm (Tate)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the years leading up to the war, many modernists began to turn their attention to their media; writers and authors broke free of traditional parameters of form and imagery and brought the very materials of their crafts to the forefront. They questioned the solidity of the bond between representation and meaning. Works like T.S. Eliot&rsquo;s poem, &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; Mark Gertler&rsquo;s <em>Merry-Go-Round </em>(above), or Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s <em>Mrs. Dalloway&nbsp;</em>sought to shock, alienate, or provoke audiences and to thereby explore new sensory and intellectual effects in art and literature.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the modernist movement had begun prior to the war, the conflict&rsquo;s vast scale, brutality, and costs fascinated many artists and writers. The war definitively ended many social and cultural traditions that survived the nineteenth century and made clear the modern, mechanized world we were entering, a world where the older expressive forms and techniques no longer seemed adequate, appropriate, or compelling.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Women Writers and Artists</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Women artists and writers played a significant role in documenting civilian and service experiences. Vera Brittain, who volunteered as a nurse, recorded her impressions of work and loss in her memoir, <em>Testament of Youth</em>, one of the war&rsquo;s most recognized autobiographical works. Women artists documented other civilian realities such as female workers in factories&mdash;doing jobs vacated by men in the military&mdash; who had become crucial for war-related production.</p>\n"
"\n"

We can see the exhaustion that the workers are feeling. The women here look somewhat relieved for their tea break. Their resigned expressions and slouching posture underscore the mental and physical fatigue of this critical but dangerous line of work, but they also make us recognize the more emotional weariness of the civilian war experience.</p>\n"

And, on November 11, 1920, a solemn ceremony dedicated two of Britain&rsquo;s most famous public war monuments, Edward Lutyens&rsquo;s <em>Whitehall Cenotaph</em> and the<em> </em>Unknown Warrior, buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>\n"

"<p>Paul Nash&rsquo;s 1917 work, <em>The Menin Road</em>, depicts a ruined Belgian landscape. Before us, dead tree trunks rise in a wasteland of mud and standing water. This spooky, alienating, place includes strange clouds of smoke penetrated here and there by searchlights. Despite these beams of light, we cannot see anything past the immediate scene. Here is chaos, irrevocable change, and devastation.</p>\n"

"<h3>Carrying poetry to war</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>First World War literature also presents a range of perspectives. Rupert Brooke&rsquo;s patriotic &lsquo;1914&rsquo; sonnet sequence became hugely popular in the early years of the war. At the outset of the war, many Britons were touched by the heroic sentiments of the poems, in particular, &ldquo;The Soldier.&rdquo; This poem&rsquo;s combatant speaker assures the reader that his death in battle will mean that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some corner of a foreign field/That is for ever England.&rdquo; Brooke&rsquo;s poems pictured military service and death as purifying and noble. At the start of the war, when such nationalistic feeling was strong, many British soldiers departed for training with a copy of Brooke&rsquo;s poems tucked into their kits. However, after years of devastating losses and with no clear resolution to the seemingly endless fighting, poets depicting the hard reality of the soldier&rsquo;s experience gained more recognition. Wilfred Owen&rsquo;s gloomy 1917 &ldquo;Anthem for Doomed Youth&rdquo; pictures the war&rsquo;s fallen &ldquo;d[ying] as cattle,&rdquo; for example. Siegfried Sassoon&rsquo;s 1918 piece, &ldquo;Counter-Attack,&rdquo; offers us the gruesome vision of a battlefield &ldquo;place rotten with dead&rdquo; where corpses &ldquo;face downward, in the sucking mud,/Wallow&hellip;&rdquo; Sassoon&rsquo;s shocking verbal image recalls the horrible tableau of Nevinson&rsquo;s dead soldiers lying facedown in the mud.</p>\n"

"<h3>A Note on WWI and Modernism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mark Gertler, Merry-Go-Round, 1916,oil on canvas, 189.2 x 142.2 cm (Tate)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/107f1de96b16eb969b372643c77f9fb37c669328.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Mark Gertler, Merry-Go-Round, 1916,oil on canvas, 189.2 x 142.2 cm (Tate)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the years leading up to the war, many modernists began to turn their attention to their media; writers and authors broke free of traditional parameters of form and imagery and brought the very materials of their crafts to the forefront. They questioned the solidity of the bond between representation and meaning. Works like T.S. Eliot&rsquo;s poem, &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; Mark Gertler&rsquo;s <em>Merry-Go-Round </em>(above), or Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s <em>Mrs. Dalloway&nbsp;</em>sought to shock, alienate, or provoke audiences and to thereby explore new sensory and intellectual effects in art and literature.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the modernist movement had begun prior to the war, the conflict&rsquo;s vast scale, brutality, and costs fascinated many artists and writers. The war definitively ended many social and cultural traditions that survived the nineteenth century and made clear the modern, mechanized world we were entering, a world where the older expressive forms and techniques no longer seemed adequate, appropriate, or compelling.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Women Writers and Artists</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Women artists and writers played a significant role in documenting civilian and service experiences. Vera Brittain, who volunteered as a nurse, recorded her impressions of work and loss in her memoir, <em>Testament of Youth</em>, one of the war&rsquo;s most recognized autobiographical works. Women artists documented other civilian realities such as female workers in factories&mdash;doing jobs vacated by men in the military&mdash; who had become crucial for war-related production.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Flora Lion, Women's Canteen at Phoenix Works, Bradford, 1918, oil on canvas, 106.6 x 182.8 mm (Imperial War Museum, London)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e4d0fdaff94357324608bf64fc5b04fdbbdfbec9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Flora Lion, <em>Women&#39;s Canteen at Phoenix Works, Bradford</em>, 1918, oil on canvas, 106.6 x 182.8 mm (Imperial War Museum, London)</span></span>Flora Lion for example, shows us a canteen for women munitions (weapons) workers in her painting, <em>Women&rsquo;s Canteen at Phoenix Works, Bradford</em>. We can see the exhaustion that the workers are feeling. The women here look somewhat relieved for their tea break. Their resigned expressions and slouching posture underscore the mental and physical fatigue of this critical but dangerous line of work, but they also make us recognize the more emotional weariness of the civilian war experience.</p>\n"

British soldiers killed in action were buried overseas, so that public officials and grieving families were challenged to represent both personal and national losses. To recognize individual sacrifices, the British government issued memorial bronze plaques and paper scrolls to the family of each serviceperson who died as a result of the war. And, on November 11, 1920, a solemn ceremony dedicated two of Britain&rsquo;s most famous public war monuments, Edward Lutyens&rsquo;s <em>Whitehall Cenotaph</em> and the<em> Unknown Soldier</em>, buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Plaque: Equestrian Oba and Attendants, Edo peoples (Benin Kingdom), 1550–1680, brass, H. 19 7/16 x W. 16 1/2 x D. 4 1/2 in. /49.5 x 41.9 x 11.4 cm (Metropolitan Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e8793f1a13d3b149290fadde7a384e7587104e74.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plaque: <em>Equestrian Oba and Attendants</em>, Edo peoples (Benin Kingdom), 1550&ndash;1680, brass, H. 19 7/16 x W. 16 1/2 x D. 4 1/2 in. /49.5 x 41.9 x 11.4 cm (The Metropolitan Museum of Art)</span></span>This remarkable brass plaque, dated between 1550-1680, depicts an Oba (or&nbsp;king) and his attendants from the Benin Empire&mdash;a powerful kingdom located in present-day Nigeria. We know that the central figure is an Oba because of his distinctive coral beaded regalia. Also, attendants hold shields above his head, either to protect him from attack or possibly from the hot, tropical sun. This was a privilege only afforded to an Oba.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figures around him range in size, not because of their actual height or distance from the Oba, but rather due to their level of importance within the court. This convention of sizing human figures based on status is known as &ldquo;hieratic scale&rdquo; and is found in artwork from cultures around the world and across time. The Oba would have travelled with a large cohort of attendants, warriors, servants, diplomats, chieftains, and priests. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The plaque originally hung alongside many others on posts throughout the palace of the Oba. The order of their placement on these posts would have told the history of the royal lineage of Benin&rsquo;s Obas, who traced their dynasty all the way back to Oranmiyan, whose son was the first Oba of Benin. However, the sequence of plaques is lost to us since they were long held in storage when found by westerners in the 19th century. You may notice that the Oba rides sidesaddle on horseback, which would seem to indicate a connection to Oba Esigie (who ruled c. 1504-1550), the first Oba to travel by horse. However, without knowing the original order of the plaques, we will never know for certain whether this was Esigie, or a later Oba who emulated his brash new mode of travel.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Artists working in brass were organized under Esigie. Today, artists working in brass in Benin are part of a brass workers guild, and it was likely that previous generations would have also worked collectively. These artists created plaques and other sculptures using what is known as the &ldquo;lost wax casting technique,&rdquo; in which, first, a more malleable wax version of the final brass work is made. It is then covered in clay and fired to harden the clay, removing the wax, which melts away in the process (hence the term, &ldquo;lost wax&rdquo;). Hot, molten liquid brass is then poured into the clay mold. As the brass cools, it hardens, and the clay is removed, revealing the finished plaque.&nbsp;</p>\n"

By eighteen, she was already producing her first still life paintings and starting to establish her long and successful career.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Working Mother</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At twenty nine, Rusch married portrait painter Juriaen Pool, with whom she had ten children. Despite her enormous domestic responsibilities, she was remarkably prolific, producing more than 250 paintings over seven decades. Her works were in great demand, and she achieved widespread fame and international recognition. Considered one of the most successful artists of her day, contemporary Dutch writers called her &ldquo;Holland&rsquo;s art prodigy&rdquo; and &ldquo;our subtle art heroine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Consumer Society</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1648, the Netherlands became independent from Spain, ushering in a period of great economic prosperity. Flourishing international trade and a thriving capitalistic economy resulted in a newly affluent middle class. Wealthy merchants created a new kind of patronage and art market. Without a powerful monarchy or the Catholic Church to commission artworks (the Dutch were Protestants), artists produced directly for buyers. Like today, buyers purchased art either from professional dealers or from the artist in their studios. Subjects like big historical, mythological or religious paintings were no longer desired; buyers wanted portraits, still lifes, landscapes and genre paintings (scenes of everyday life) to decorate their homes. Proud of their newly independent country and trade wealth, they desired artworks that would reflect their success. In a competitive open market, artists began to specialize. Rachel Ruysch became known as one of the greatest flower painters of her time.</p>\n"

The Netherlands became the largest importers of new and exotic plants and flowers from around the world. Once valued primarily for their use as herbs or medicine, flowers became newly appreciated simply for their beauty and fragrance. They became prized luxuries and desirable status symbols for the wealthy. Botanists and gardeners sought the rarest specimens imported from overseas trade. The tulip, like the one featured prominently in Ruysch&rsquo;s painting below, was the most exotic.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;Tulip Mania&rdquo;&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Coveted for their intense and unusually varied colors, tulips were introduced into the Netherlands from Turkey in the late 16th century. The Dutch fell madly in love with them. Because it takes so long for a tulip to be grown from seed, demand far outpaced supply. The rarest and most valuable tulips were the variegated or &ldquo;flamed&rdquo; tulips, those with feathers of contrasting color on their petals. This exotic coloration was actually caused by a virus that infected the tulip, shortening its life span and making it even more sought after and valuable. The stage was set for a buying craze.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The word tulip mania is often used today to refer to certain types of economic crises. It describes a financial bubble caused by large numbers of people speculating on unproved commodities or companies. Tulip bulbs were so avidly desired in 17th century Netherlands that a &ldquo;futures market&rdquo; was born. &nbsp;Buyers bought bulbs still in the ground, speculating that they would be worth more in the future and could then be sold for a large profit. Prices rose steadily and irrationally. At the peak of tulip speculation in 1636, some bulbs sold for more than a skilled craftsman earned in ten years. A nursery catalog of the time notes that at the height of the madness, a rare &ldquo;Semper Augustus&rdquo; tulip sold for 5,200 guiders, more than the price of a fine house, a ship or twelve acres of land.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In February, 1637, investors suddenly decided that tulip bulbs were grossly overpriced, and began to sell. Within days, panic ensued. With more sellers than buyers, demand for tulips evaporated. Prices plummeted, tulip bulbs lost 90% of their earlier value, and the market crashed. The world had just experienced its first financial bubble. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<p>A successful Dutch still life painting was highly valued for its degree of skillful realism. <em>Flowers Still Life</em> depicts a profusion of scientifically accurate floral details. Each petal, stem, and leaf is minutely and precisely rendered. Textures are remarkably realistic, from the delicate paper thin poppy petals to the crinkly, brittle leaves. Looking closer still, we see that Ruysch has also meticulously depicted tiny insects: a caterpillar crawls on a stem, a bee gathers pollen from the center of a poppy, a white butterfly alights on a marigold.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><em>Flower&nbsp;Still Life</em> depicts a lush variety of different flowers, from popular common European blooms to rare overseas species. Ruysch combines a complex and intricate arrangement of poppies, snapdragons, roses, carnations, hollyhocks, marigolds, morning glories and a single red and white flamed tulip. Flowers lavishly spill out of the vase, filling the entire picture space. Some are in full bloom, others droop and wilt, as leaves and curving stems entwine throughout.&nbsp;While many of her contemporary flower painters used more symmetrical and formal compositions, Ruysch was known for these lively and informal looking arrangements. The flowers are asymmetrically arranged, leading the eye diagonally from the lower left drooping marigold to the upper right red poppy. Our eye is first attracted to the lightest flowers in the center, then to the brightly colored surrounding flowers, and finally out to the small darker flowers at the edges of the bouquet. Complementary colors create harmony, as warm yellows and rose balance cool blues and greens. Light alternates with shadow, enlivening the flowers as they stand out dramatically against the darker background.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;Vanitas&rdquo;: Hidden Meanings?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some scholars believe there is another way to view Ruysch&rsquo;s flower paintings. One common interpretation is to understand them in light of <em>vanitas</em>, a moral message common at the time. Taken from a passage in the Christian bible, it was a reminder that beauty fades and all living things must die. While still life paintings celebrated the beauty and luxury of fine food or voluptuous flowers, <em>vanitas</em> was a warning about the fleeting nature of these material things and the shortness of life. In <em>Flowers Still Life</em>, some flowers wilt and die while insects have eaten holes in the leaves. Wealthy Dutch consumers were being reminded to not become too attached to their material possessions and worldly pleasures; eternal salvation came only through devotion to God.</p>\n"

"<p><u>Background</u></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the summer of 2012 and then in the winter of 2013, I traveled to Lima, Peru to train administrators and teachers on the use and implementation of Khan Academy in math classrooms. &nbsp;I learned of this opportunity through the Khan Academy team and accepted the invitation from Innova Schools in Peru. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Innova Schools is an ambitious educational private project in Latin America, planning to become the largest school network in the region by 2018. Currently operating 11 schools in Lima, Peru, the company will have at least 70 world-class schools throughout Peru by 2016. Their vision is to provide affordable high-quality education to Peruvian children, and my role was to help them innovate their math program with Khan Academy.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Innova Schools believe in the Blended Learning model, and they have structured the curriculum, instruction, and experiences of the students to uphold this model. &nbsp;Blended learning is a formal education program in which a student learns at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some element of student control over time, place, path, and/or pace.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To achieve blended learning in the subject of Math, Innova Schools adopted Khan Academy as the online source of content instruction. &nbsp;Innova Schools identify this time of independent learning as Solo-Learning, and twice a week, the students&rsquo; solo-learning activity is using Khan Academy to learn and practice the math curriculum. &nbsp;Innova Schools&rsquo; administrators worked tirelessly alongside a publishing company and teachers to align Khan Academy videos and exercises to the content standards/objectives for each grade. &nbsp;Each day&rsquo;s math lesson is planned out for every grade, and the selected Khan Academy videos and exercises are communicated to students as goals for their weekly Solo-Learning time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>First Trip to Peru: July 2012</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During my first visit to Peru, my main focus and goal was to introduce Khan Academy to Innova School administrators, to a select group of teachers, and then to meet the first cohort of students who&rsquo;d be piloting Khan Academy. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I began showing the Innova Schools administrators how using Khan Academy supports their Blended Learning model. &nbsp;Then, I gave them a tour of Khan Academy and explained all the resources available through Khan Academy for student and teacher support. &nbsp;I helped them navigate the dashboard and showed them the numerous layers of data available for teachers to use for student-centered learning. &nbsp;My presentation was videotaped so that it could be used again with different audiences. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I was then introduced to two math teachers who were chosen to be the first to pilot Khan Academy in their classes. &nbsp;Like I was at the very beginning, these teachers knew the potential of Khan Academy, but they were unsure how to use it in a practical way in the classroom. &nbsp;Each teacher had spent time watching videos, working on exercises, and touring the dashboard, but they needed a plan, a structure, and a system of how to make it work in the classroom. &nbsp;With these teachers, I began by empathizing with their fears and confusion. &nbsp;Once we knew that we were all on the same page, I shared the teacher-guide I had created to walk the teachers through the steps for implementation. &nbsp;A helpful coach at Innova Schools helped me translate the guide into Spanish! &nbsp;I shared my system of unit packets, unit lands, folders, journals, pre-tests, post-tests, Swiss Cheese, the Help board, peer tutoring, active listening lessons, and a step by step example of a day&rsquo;s math instruction using Khan Academy. &nbsp;The teachers took notes, asked many questions, practiced on their own, and as time passed, their faces became calm and assured as everything began to make sense. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>I also shared many project ideas and ways to teach problem solving and critical thinking skills. &nbsp;Like I was in the very beginning, they were also concerned about ways to incorporate and develop more conceptual understanding in their students. &nbsp;The days of Solo-Learning without Khan Academy are devoted to project-based learning and problem solving skills. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I was also fortunate enough to meet the actual students who&rsquo;d be piloting Khan Academy. &nbsp;They had heard about it and simply knew it to be something very good. &nbsp;My job was to get them pumped up; I let them know that they were amongst the first in their country to embark on a new way of learning. &nbsp;This energized them, but the real energy came when they found out they&rsquo;d have their own computer laptops! &nbsp;The cheers were deafening and the smiles were contagious. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After these workshops, these teachers went to their classrooms and began the Khan Academy implementation process in their math classes. &nbsp;Like me, they hadn&rsquo;t grasped everything 100% before they started; they just started. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>Second Trip to Peru: &nbsp;February 2013</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During my second trip to Peru, I had Khan Academy workshops for the next group of teachers, school principals, and math coaches. &nbsp;During this trip, I not only visited Innova Schools in Lima, but traveled to Innova Schools in surrounding towns several hours away. &nbsp;I met principals, coaches, and teachers, and together, we learned about blended learning and Khan Academy. &nbsp;They were jazzed up knowing that they were at the forefront of education innovation, and they were ready to take a risk and try something new. &nbsp;Like me, they also knew that teaching had become entirely too teacher-centered, and they also struggled knowing that they weren&rsquo;t reaching every students&rsquo; needs. &nbsp;They were ready for a change. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>Afterthoughts</u></h2>\n"
"\n"

"<p><u>背景</u></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the summer of 2012 and then in the winter of 2013, I traveled to Lima, Peru to train administrators and teachers on the use and implementation of Khan Academy in math classrooms. &nbsp;I learned of this opportunity through the Khan Academy team and accepted the invitation from Innova Schools in Peru. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Innova Schools is an ambitious educational private project in Latin America, planning to become the largest school network in the region by 2018. Currently operating 11 schools in Lima, Peru, the company will have at least 70 world-class schools throughout Peru by 2016. Their vision is to provide affordable high-quality education to Peruvian children, and my role was to help them innovate their math program with Khan Academy.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Innova Schools believe in the Blended Learning model, and they have structured the curriculum, instruction, and experiences of the students to uphold this model. &nbsp;Blended learning is a formal education program in which a student learns at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some element of student control over time, place, path, and/or pace.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To achieve blended learning in the subject of Math, Innova Schools adopted Khan Academy as the online source of content instruction. &nbsp;Innova Schools identify this time of independent learning as Solo-Learning, and twice a week, the students&rsquo; solo-learning activity is using Khan Academy to learn and practice the math curriculum. &nbsp;Innova Schools&rsquo; administrators worked tirelessly alongside a publishing company and teachers to align Khan Academy videos and exercises to the content standards/objectives for each grade. &nbsp;Each day&rsquo;s math lesson is planned out for every grade, and the selected Khan Academy videos and exercises are communicated to students as goals for their weekly Solo-Learning time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>First Trip to Peru: July 2012</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During my first visit to Peru, my main focus and goal was to introduce Khan Academy to Innova School administrators, to a select group of teachers, and then to meet the first cohort of students who&rsquo;d be piloting Khan Academy. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I began showing the Innova Schools administrators how using Khan Academy supports their Blended Learning model. &nbsp;Then, I gave them a tour of Khan Academy and explained all the resources available through Khan Academy for student and teacher support. &nbsp;I helped them navigate the dashboard and showed them the numerous layers of data available for teachers to use for student-centered learning. &nbsp;My presentation was videotaped so that it could be used again with different audiences. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I was then introduced to two math teachers who were chosen to be the first to pilot Khan Academy in their classes. &nbsp;Like I was at the very beginning, these teachers knew the potential of Khan Academy, but they were unsure how to use it in a practical way in the classroom. &nbsp;Each teacher had spent time watching videos, working on exercises, and touring the dashboard, but they needed a plan, a structure, and a system of how to make it work in the classroom. &nbsp;With these teachers, I began by empathizing with their fears and confusion. &nbsp;Once we knew that we were all on the same page, I shared the teacher-guide I had created to walk the teachers through the steps for implementation. &nbsp;A helpful coach at Innova Schools helped me translate the guide into Spanish! &nbsp;I shared my system of unit packets, unit lands, folders, journals, pre-tests, post-tests, Swiss Cheese, the Help board, peer tutoring, active listening lessons, and a step by step example of a day&rsquo;s math instruction using Khan Academy. &nbsp;The teachers took notes, asked many questions, practiced on their own, and as time passed, their faces became calm and assured as everything began to make sense. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>I also shared many project ideas and ways to teach problem solving and critical thinking skills. &nbsp;Like I was in the very beginning, they were also concerned about ways to incorporate and develop more conceptual understanding in their students. &nbsp;The days of Solo-Learning without Khan Academy are devoted to project-based learning and problem solving skills. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I was also fortunate enough to meet the actual students who&rsquo;d be piloting Khan Academy. &nbsp;They had heard about it and simply knew it to be something very good. &nbsp;My job was to get them pumped up; I let them know that they were amongst the first in their country to embark on a new way of learning. &nbsp;This energized them, but the real energy came when they found out they&rsquo;d have their own computer laptops! &nbsp;The cheers were deafening and the smiles were contagious. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After these workshops, these teachers went to their classrooms and began the Khan Academy implementation process in their math classes. &nbsp;Like me, they hadn&rsquo;t grasped everything 100% before they started; they just started. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>Second Trip to Peru: &nbsp;February 2013</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During my second trip to Peru, I had Khan Academy workshops for the next group of teachers, school principals, and math coaches. &nbsp;During this trip, I not only visited Innova Schools in Lima, but traveled to Innova Schools in surrounding towns several hours away. &nbsp;I met principals, coaches, and teachers, and together, we learned about blended learning and Khan Academy. &nbsp;They were jazzed up knowing that they were at the forefront of education innovation, and they were ready to take a risk and try something new. &nbsp;Like me, they also knew that teaching had become entirely too teacher-centered, and they also struggled knowing that they weren&rsquo;t reaching every students&rsquo; needs. &nbsp;They were ready for a change. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>Afterthoughts</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In these two trips to Peru, I was encouraged and strengthened by the common language and unique experiences that all teachers share. &nbsp;Their faces and expressions were familiar to me; and though the language barrier separated us from verbal communication, I know that all of us knew that we were all in this together. &nbsp;We shared a purpose and mission, and we knew that we were there to help one another toward the common goal of excellence in education. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>In terms of painting, Europe was most definitely leading the way, the Louvre first opening its doors to the public in 1793, granting access to the French royal family&rsquo;s former collection of art. In England, on the other hand, public access to works of art was largely a private enterprise. The Egyptian Hall in London&rsquo;s Pall Mall being a good example. With its<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d1c9728ba39dc9a2a9d5125c96f62eadd8361ec0.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Peter Frederick Robertson, Egyptian Hall, 1812, (London (destroyed))</span></span> evocative neo-Egyptian fa&ccedil;ade, it was here Gericault exhibited his <em>The Raft of the Medusa </em>in 1820 and at other times large-scale works by important British painters such as Turner were on display, always to a paying audience (a shilling). It was not until the opening of the National Gallery in 1824, over thirty years after the Louvre, that the British had an art collection that belonged to the public and which they were free to visit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>While lagging behind in some ways, in others London was somewhat ahead of the rest. It was here, for example, that the first public museum in the world was opened. &nbsp;The British Museum, was established in 1753 and open, free of charge &ldquo;to all studious and curious Persons.&rdquo; Well, in actual fact, there were quite stringent conditions for entry, being closed four days a week and all of August and September too. Then when it was open, visitors needed to apply for a ticket and present a letter of recommendation, while women, for propriety&rsquo;s sake, were only admitted in pairs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Museum, in its first incarnation, was located in a grand mansion on Montague Street, the site of the present building. Along with books and manuscripts, its collection held some 80,000 objects of natural history and &ldquo;man-made curiosities,&rdquo; all of which were bequeathed<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c4f52917e0277d15ed833fcaf705b2959e6cf40c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane Hand Axe, c. 350,000 BCE, flint, 165mm long, The British Museum (London)</span></span> to the nation by the Royal Physician and chocolatier Hans Sloane, among them a very old flint hand axe found near the bones of a massive elephant buried in the gravel on Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane. While it is very doubtful those first curious and studious persons who entered the museum could conceivably have guessed its true date at 350,000 years or that massive elephants roamed the country back in the Stone Age, the questions such objects raised were absolutely fundamental to the emergence of new sciences in the nineteenth century, such as archeology, anthropology, geology and paleontology.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The commission for the new building was given to Robert Smirke, a well-established neoclassical architect. The building took around thirty years to complete, its elevation mirroring the expanse of the British Empire itself. He started with the east wing, built to house the King&rsquo;s Library. It survives complete today and is considered one of the greatest neoclassical interiors in London.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In 1827 construction on the remaining wings was begun, creating the famous quadrangle with its impressive colonnaded portico and two acre courtyard. The antique sourcing of the fa&ccedil;ade is predictable enough. Neoclassicism had been the prevailing fashion in European architecture since the 1750s and would have seemed an appropriate choice, especially given the number and quality of classical sculptures in the Museum (particularly the Parthenon sculptures). &nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These must surely have influenced Smirke&rsquo;s design of the main entrance, which is modelled on Greek temple design and shares the same number of eight columns as the Parthenon itself. In scale though it is almost double the size, while the austere doric order is replaced by the based and slender columns and scrolled capitals of the ionic order, which, with all its connotations of wisdom and learning, must have been thought best suited for the building&rsquo;s purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/805eb25ee0b11867161224a78dad19415c1d4435.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Entablature (detail) Robert Smirke, The British Museum, 1823-57 (London)</span></span>The entablature (the entire horizontal area carried by the columns) is composed of a tripartite architrave (the lowest part of the entablature) with a blind frieze above (without sculptural decoration) and a dentilated cornice (dentils are the repeated blocks forming a pattern at the base of the cornice)&mdash;all running in an unbroken chain around the whole length of the south portico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The building is topped with a flat roof, the pediment therefore being false, in the sense that its function is decorative rather than structural, its pinnacle creating a vertical axis that bisects the main entrance way. The projecting wings, like the skene or scenic backdrop in an ancient Greek theatre, add&nbsp;a dramatic sweep to the fa&ccedil;ade, channelling the eye of the viewer to the main entrance.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The conscious reworking of the classical language of architecture, drawing on a period which, according to enlightened tastes, marked the greatest flowering of art and culture in European history, obviously served to elevate the status of the building, expressing something of the pride and confidence of the British at the very heyday of their empire. While not necessarily equating Britain with Rome or Greece, the building did seem to suggest, firstly, that the British were carrying the torch of civilisation and, secondly, that they, like the Romans and the Greeks before them, were up to the task.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This explicit nationalist message is illustrated in the pediment sculptures, designed by Richard Westmacott and given the grandiose name,<em> The Rise of Civilisation</em>. Here we see a female Britannia-like figure representing Enlightenment, surrounded by other allegorical figures standing for various artistic and scientific disciplines.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/33c7dd4aaca90762588361955f6aa7e69869d679.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Richard Westmacott, <em>The Rise of Civilisation</em>,<br />\n"

Here early man emerges, crawling from rubble to be handed the Lamp of Knowledge by the Angel of Enlightenment, behind him is a dog-like animal and behind that a crocodile. Though hard to pick out from ground level, that crocodile&rsquo;s snout is one of the most telling details in the whole sculpture, offering a foretaste of the debates that were soon to rage between religious and scientific communities. Though Darwin had yet to publish his On the Origin of Species, with the type of fossil and geological evidence that the Museum was amassing, the case for evolution was certainly mounting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>New Technologies</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although on the face of it, the Museum might seem to be a very conservative building, the manner in which it was constructed was anything but. Smirke, for instance, was one of the first architects to make extensive use of concrete, laying it as a base for the cast iron frame that underpins the entire structure, a frame that was then filled with London stock brick and covered in a facing of Portland stone,<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/401d6350ef493bfcfe137085b78cd8180cb05ff4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Weston Hall, 1845-47, The British Museum (London)</span></span> brought all the way from Dorset.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the design of the interior, too, which was overseen by Smirke&rsquo;s brother, Sydney from 1845 onwards, British materials were used throughout, the floor of the entrance hall&mdash;the Weston Hall&mdash;being paved with York stone, the staircase balustrade and ornamental vases carved from Huddlestone stone and the sides of the Grand Staircase lined with red Aberdeen granite. While, the fact that these materials were all sourced from the British Isles reinforced the nationalist message, the vivid colours of the stones themselves created a luminous interior that was further adorned with colorful designs based on those found on classical buildings, which by the nineteenth century were known to be polychromatic. The original stonework has all survived to this day, while the 1847 painting and gilding was restored in 2000. The electric lamps in the hall are also replicas of the original, installed in 1879, making the Museum one of the first public buildings in London to be electrically lit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Reading Room</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the 1850s, with the collection continuing to expand, the site needed a yet larger library, the idea this time being to construct a round room in the central courtyard. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d99be86f90777578a8b4d8c434a8ff6678b08036.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Reading Room, 1854-7, The British Museum (London)</span></span>Designed by Sydney Smirke, the Reading Room was built between 1854-1857. Given the size of it, 42.6m in diameter, the speed of construction, even assisted by modern building techniques, was astounding. Using cast iron, concrete and glass, it was a masterpiece of nineteenth-century technology, inspired as much by Paxton&rsquo;s ferrovitreous Crystal Palace as by the Pantheon in Rome; the airy and graceful internal dome disguising the complex fretwork of cast iron that supported it from without. Even the bookshelves were state-of-the-art, built of iron to carry the weight of the books and making up a staggering three miles of cases and twenty-five miles of shelving.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Recent Times</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This was not the end of the story, though. In 1997, the books were relocated yet again to the newly built British Library on Euston Road and the old Reading Room transformed into an exhibition space, a move that provided the catalyst to revitalise the old courtyard. In 2000, Foster and Partner&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II Great Court was opened and the two buildings, the Museum and the Reading Room, were now connected with a huge glazed canopy spanning the two acres of the courtyard. And the story still continues, for even more recently yet more changes have been made, with the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centres, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners, due to open in 2014.</span><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beedf6420cb14db2fb3f8591a7084c3644f5c0ce.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Foster and Partners, Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, 1997</span></span>That the site is a constantly evolving one is only to be expected, given the ever-changing nature of the collection itself. An astonishing compendium of 260 years of human discoveries, the British Museum is indeed a house filled with many mansions, the outside of which, in the last analysis, however brilliant and varied in its construction it may be, will never come close to matching the glories within.</p>\n"

"<p>The conscious reworking of the classical language of architecture, drawing on a period which, according to enlightened tastes, marked the greatest flowering of art and culture in European history, obviously served to elevate the status of the building, expressing something of the pride and confidence of the British at the very heyday of their empire. While not necessarily equating Britain with Rome or Greece, the building did seem to suggest, firstly, that the British were carrying the torch of civilisation and, secondly, that they, like the Romans and the Greeks before them, were up to the task.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This explicit nationalist message is illustrated in the pediment sculptures, designed by Richard Westmacott and given the grandiose name,<em> The Rise of Civilisation</em>. Here we see a female Britannia-like figure representing Enlightenment, surrounded by other allegorical figures standing for various artistic and scientific disciplines.</p>\n"

"<span>Pediment of British Museum, 1845-51 (London)</span></span></span>To the far left, however, we find a different story. Here early man emerges, crawling from rubble to be handed the Lamp of Knowledge by the Angel of Enlightenment, behind him is a dog-like animal and behind that a crocodile. Though hard to pick out from ground level, that crocodile&rsquo;s snout is one of the most telling details in the whole sculpture, offering a foretaste of the debates that were soon to rage between religious and scientific communities. Though Darwin had yet to publish his On the Origin of Species, with the type of fossil and geological evidence that the Museum was amassing, the case for evolution was certainly mounting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>New Technologies</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although on the face of it, the Museum might seem to be a very conservative building, the manner in which it was constructed was anything but. Smirke, for instance, was one of the first architects to make extensive use of concrete, laying it as a base for the cast iron frame that underpins the entire structure, a frame that was then filled with London stock brick and covered in a facing of Portland stone,<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/401d6350ef493bfcfe137085b78cd8180cb05ff4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Weston Hall, 1845-47, The British Museum (London)</span></span> brought all the way from Dorset.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the design of the interior, too, which was overseen by Smirke&rsquo;s brother, Sydney from 1845 onwards, British materials were used throughout, the floor of the entrance hall&mdash;the Weston Hall&mdash;being paved with York stone, the staircase balustrade and ornamental vases carved from Huddlestone stone and the sides of the Grand Staircase lined with red Aberdeen granite. While, the fact that these materials were all sourced from the British Isles reinforced the nationalist message, the vivid colours of the stones themselves created a luminous interior that was further adorned with colorful designs based on those found on classical buildings, which by the nineteenth century were known to be polychromatic. The original stonework has all survived to this day, while the 1847 painting and gilding was restored in 2000. The electric lamps in the hall are also replicas of the original, installed in 1879, making the Museum one of the first public buildings in London to be electrically lit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Reading Room</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the 1850s, with the collection continuing to expand, the site needed a yet larger library, the idea this time being to construct a round room in the central courtyard. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d99be86f90777578a8b4d8c434a8ff6678b08036.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Reading Room, 1854-7, The British Museum (London)</span></span>Designed by Sydney Smirke, the Reading Room was built between 1854-1857. Given the size of it, 42.6m in diameter, the speed of construction, even assisted by modern building techniques, was astounding. Using cast iron, concrete and glass, it was a masterpiece of nineteenth-century technology, inspired as much by Paxton&rsquo;s ferrovitreous Crystal Palace as by the Pantheon in Rome; the airy and graceful internal dome disguising the complex fretwork of cast iron that supported it from without. Even the bookshelves were state-of-the-art, built of iron to carry the weight of the books and making up a staggering three miles of cases and twenty-five miles of shelving.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Recent Times</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This was not the end of the story, though. In 1997, the books were relocated yet again to the newly built British Library on Euston Road and the old Reading Room transformed into an exhibition space, a move that provided the catalyst to revitalise the old courtyard. In 2000, Foster and Partner&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II Great Court was opened and the two buildings, the Museum and the Reading Room, were now connected with a huge glazed canopy spanning the two acres of the courtyard. And the story still continues, for even more recently yet more changes have been made, with the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centres, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners, due to open in 2014.</span><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beedf6420cb14db2fb3f8591a7084c3644f5c0ce.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Foster and Partners, Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, 1997</span></span>That the site is a constantly evolving one is only to be expected, given the ever-changing nature of the collection itself. An astonishing compendium of 260 years of human discoveries, the British Museum is indeed a house filled with many mansions, the outside of which, in the last analysis, however brilliant and varied in its construction it may be, will never come close to matching the glories within.</p>\n"

Painted largely out of doors at the &quot;Lover&rsquo;s Seat&quot; (a scenic outlook) above Covehurst Bay near Hastings on the south coast of England, the scene captures a tranquil spot inhabited only by a flock of sheep.

"\n"
"<p>Hunt captures the beauty of an English summer day. The brightness of the sunlight is interrupted only by the shadows of the clouds they move across the landscape. The sea glitters in the distance on the far left. The cliffs are pushed up to the top of the picture frame, leaving little room for the sky.

"\n"
"<h3>Pre-Raphaelite Truth to Nature</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>True to the ideals of Pre-Raphaelitism, Hunt painted every flower, bramble and blade of grass with extreme attention to detail. The texture gives the impression that you could reach out feel the uneven clumps of wool on the sheep, and Hunt even pays attention to the red marking, used to differentiate ownership, on each member of the flock. Hunt, who had introduced the Pre-Raphaelites to the ideas of John Ruskin, was perhaps the most faithful follower of Ruskin&rsquo;s advice to &ldquo;go to Nature in all singleness of heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n"
"&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Political and Moral Content</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Also following in the tradition of Ruskin is the fact that the painting carries a moral content. The title <em>Our English Coasts</em> related to the fact that at the time of the unguarded state of the many miles of English coastline was a serious topic of discussion at the time.

"\n"
"<h3>Hunt and the Pre-Raphaelites</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Hunt was born in London in 1827 and became a student at the Royal Academy School in 1844, where he met Millais. He also became a close friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti when the two bonded over a mutual regard for the work of the poet Keats.

"<h3>Rene Descartes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d7a816a5c9d01842819cb8981fa998f2ecfc7178.jpg\" /><br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-caption\">Frans Hals,&nbsp;<em>Portrait of Rene Descartes</em>, 1649, oil on canvas, 19 x 14 cm (Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen)</span></span> want to raise Cartesian philosophy here. The word is capitalized because it refers to the philosophy of the proto-enlightenment thinker Rene Descartes. Even if you have never heard of this great rationalist, it is likely that you will recognize one of his phrases such as &quot;I think, therefore, I am.&quot; This odd sentence is the result of his effort to find irrefutable proof that he actually existed. Philosophers often ask questions that are meant to reveal fundamental truths. Can you imagine for a moment asking yourself this very question--How can I actually prove that I exist? Descartes realized an elegent solution, his very ability to ask the question was the proof of independent consciousness and therefore, of his existence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>With such questions, Descartes raised many considerations that would shape the modern world. Sometimes these questions raised, in turn, conclusions seemingly at odds with each other, such as his scepticism of both perception and of self-evident assumption.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Objective and Subjective Knowledge</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ironically, such thoughts would eventually lead to a reappraisal of our confidence in society&#39;s scientific empiricism. Empiricism relies upon objectivity. You will remember that the word &quot;objective&quot; means a truth that is beyond personal experience. In contrast, the word &quot;subjective&quot; is directly linked to personal experience.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Here is an example. Imagine a minor accident between a taxi and a city bus. A patrolman comes along to reconstruct the event. Does he only ask the cab driver what took place or does he also ask the passenger in the back of the cab and the bus driver and the riders on the bus? The cop&#39;s goal is the reconstruct what &quot;actually&quot; happened. But if we take a post-Cartesian position we might ask whether there really was a single actual (objective) event or whether there were actually multiple (subjective) truths, each the result of each witness&#39;s perspective. Let&#39;s take a more directly applicable example. Look about the room that you are currently in. It probably has six sides: four walls, a floor, and a ceiling. When an architect drew a diagram of your room, he/she would have conceptually stepped outside of the space so that it could be understood in total.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>C&eacute;zanne and subjective experience</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c6bbe0aa69f82c857d35b654e616761c40de3e7b.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Paul C&eacute;zanne, detail&nbsp;<em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, c. 1894 oil on canvas, 70.6 x 57.3 cm&nbsp;(Courtauld Gallery, London)</span></span>But is this objective view a false one? Now in the built room, you cannot see its totality in a single moment. We can only see bits and pieces of the room at any one time and must rely upon memory to understand the room as a whole. Your more subjective experience has historically been considered less important than the architect&#39;s objective conception even though you experience directly and the architect knows the room only theoretically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Regarding the traditional heirarchical relationship between objective and subjective, C&eacute;zanne seems to ask, &quot;which is more true?&quot; and his conclusion mirrors an important development of modernism. In <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, it is the subjective view that constructs the space. C&eacute;zanne has placed a plaster cast (copy) of an ancient Roman sculpture of a cupid (the son of Venus) on a tabletop so that it dominates the composition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2326b6bd3dc46788fc6bd71294e72298f86314bd.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Paul C&eacute;zanne, detail <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, c. 1894 oil on canvas, 70.6 x 57.3 cm&nbsp;(Courtauld Gallery, London)</span></span>To an artist of the 19th century such classical sculpture would refer to the great humanist triumph of the Greeks and Romans and the birth of naturalism. In fact, one of the most prominant features of such sculpture would be its contraposto (you remember this: axial shifts responding to weight borne by one leg). Actually, C&eacute;zanne&#39;s li&#39;l god-ling is also twisting at the waist, creating a subtle spiral torsion. Again, the space is odd, the floor especially, seems to rise up too steeply with the stacked canvases forming its uneven perimeter. Have you noticed that the canvases that line the floor, shape the space of the room and that this &quot;shaping&quot; is related to the twisting of the cupid? Let do this point by point. The right foot of the sculpture points roughly towards us and aligns, more or less, with the receeding orthoganol of the table. The figure&#39;s hips have turned. They are aligned with the plane of the canvas at the extreme left that is partly hidden behind the blue tablecloth. The Cupid&#39;s shoulders are turned even further and align with the canvas that rests behind the godling&#39;s torso.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This is clearly not the objective space of the architect. C&eacute;zanne has clearly sought to match the perception of space to the movement of the the body. But isn&#39;t that what we really experience? When you walk into a room, do you see the room as an objective whole? No. We can only see a fragment at a time. But as we&#39;ve already established, we don&#39;t actually see in fragements we see continuously and space is shaped by our continuous movement through it. Try it. Focus on any straight line in the room you are now in. Lean forward, and as you might expect, the angles of the room shift. In <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, we see C&eacute;zanne&#39;s attempt to render true human vision, vision that is subjective, continuous, and informed by memory.<br />\n"

"<h3>Rene Descartes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d7a816a5c9d01842819cb8981fa998f2ecfc7178.jpg\" /><br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-caption\">Frans Hals,&nbsp;<em>Portrait of Rene Descartes</em>, 1649, oil on canvas, 19 x 14 cm (Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen)</span></span> want to raise Cartesian philosophy here. The word is capitalized because it refers to the philosophy of the proto-enlightenment thinker Rene Descartes. Even if you have never heard of this great rationalist, it is likely that you will recognize one of his phrases such as &quot;I think, therefore, I am.&quot; This odd sentence is the result of his effort to find irrefutable proof that he actually existed. Philosophers often ask questions that are meant to reveal fundamental truths. Can you imagine for a moment asking yourself this very question--How can I actually prove that I exist? Descartes realized an elegent solution, his very ability to ask the question was the proof of independent consciousness and therefore, of his existence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>With such questions, Descartes raised many considerations that would shape the modern world. Sometimes these questions raised, in turn, conclusions seemingly at odds with each other, such as his scepticism of both perception and of self-evident assumption.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Objective and Subjective Knowledge</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ironically, such thoughts would eventually lead to a reappraisal of our confidence in society&#39;s scientific empiricism. Empiricism relies upon objectivity. You will remember that the word &quot;objective&quot; means a truth that is beyond personal experience. In contrast, the word &quot;subjective&quot; is directly linked to personal experience.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Here is an example. Imagine a minor accident between a taxi and a city bus. A patrolman comes along to reconstruct the event. Does he only ask the cab driver what took place or does he also ask the passenger in the back of the cab and the bus driver and the riders on the bus? The cop&#39;s goal is the reconstruct what &quot;actually&quot; happened. But if we take a post-Cartesian position we might ask whether there really was a single actual (objective) event or whether there were actually multiple (subjective) truths, each the result of each witness&#39;s perspective. Let&#39;s take a more directly applicable example. Look about the room that you are currently in. It probably has six sides: four walls, a floor, and a ceiling. When an architect drew a diagram of your room, he/she would have conceptually stepped outside of the space so that it could be understood in total.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>C&eacute;zanne and subjective experience</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c6bbe0aa69f82c857d35b654e616761c40de3e7b.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Paul C&eacute;zanne, detail&nbsp;<em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, c. 1894 oil on canvas, 70.6 x 57.3 cm&nbsp;(Courtauld Gallery, London)</span></span>But is this objective view a false one? Now in the built room, you cannot see its totality in a single moment. We can only see bits and pieces of the room at any one time and must rely upon memory to understand the room as a whole. Your more subjective experience has historically been considered less important than the architect&#39;s objective conception even though you experience directly and the architect knows the room only theoretically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Regarding the traditional heirarchical relationship between objective and subjective, C&eacute;zanne seems to ask, &quot;which is more true?&quot; and his conclusion mirrors an important development of modernism. In <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, it is the subjective view that constructs the space. C&eacute;zanne has placed a plaster cast (copy) of an ancient Roman sculpture of a cupid (the son of Venus) on a tabletop so that it dominates the composition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2326b6bd3dc46788fc6bd71294e72298f86314bd.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Paul C&eacute;zanne, detail <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, c. 1894 oil on canvas, 70.6 x 57.3 cm&nbsp;(Courtauld Gallery, London)</span></span>To an artist of the 19th century such classical sculpture would refer to the great humanist triumph of the Greeks and Romans and the birth of naturalism. In fact, one of the most prominant features of such sculpture would be its contraposto (you remember this: axial shifts responding to weight borne by one leg). Actually, C&eacute;zanne&#39;s li&#39;l god-ling is also twisting at the waist, creating a subtle spiral torsion. Again, the space is odd, the floor especially, seems to rise up too steeply with the stacked canvases forming its uneven perimeter. Have you noticed that the canvases that line the floor, shape the space of the room and that this &quot;shaping&quot; is related to the twisting of the cupid? Let do this point by point. The right foot of the sculpture points roughly towards us and aligns, more or less, with the receeding orthoganol of the table. The figure&#39;s hips have turned. They are aligned with the plane of the canvas at the extreme left that is partly hidden behind the blue tablecloth. The Cupid&#39;s shoulders are turned even further and align with the canvas that rests behind the godling&#39;s torso.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This is clearly not the objective space of the architect. C&eacute;zanne has clearly sought to match the perception of space to the movement of the the body. But isn&#39;t that what we really experience? When you walk into a room, do you see the room as an objective whole? いいえ． We can only see a fragment at a time. But as we&#39;ve already established, we don&#39;t actually see in fragements we see continuously and space is shaped by our continuous movement through it. Try it. Focus on any straight line in the room you are now in. Lean forward, and as you might expect, the angles of the room shift. In <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, we see C&eacute;zanne&#39;s attempt to render true human vision, vision that is subjective, continuous, and informed by memory.<br />\n"

How much has the world changed since when you were a kid? There was no internet, and no personal computers. Your parents didn&rsquo;t own a minivan or SUV&mdash;those didn&rsquo;t exist yet. Commercial airplanes were brand new. The world was still recovering from World War II, and if you lived in the United States you likely lived in mortal fear of a nuclear attack from the USSR. Life in 2013 may resemble life in 1950 in some ways, but there&rsquo;s no question the world is a different place, a more advanced, stranger place.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Industrial Revolution Changed Everything</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>That was the point of view of British artist Joseph Mallord William Turner (commonly known by his initials J.M.W.) in 1839. J.M.W. Turner was born in 1775, less than a month after the start of the American Revolutionary War. He grew up in a United Kingdom whose empire stretched across the globe under the watchful eye of its navy, and whose military prowess was encouraged by a booming economy driven by the Industrial Revolution.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Industrial Revolution, between roughly 1760 and 1830, brought great positive change to Great Britain. Steam power heralded a machine age filled with factories and mechanical processes. Innovations in textile machinery increased industrial output thousands of times, iron became cheap and strong enough to become an everyday building material, and gas lamps meant people could be active at all hours of the day and night. Populations increased, consumer goods became more affordable, and the middle class exploded. There was a palpable understanding that the world was changing forever.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, not all things improved. Even though the average income grew during the industrial age, standards of living plummeted for most, as did conditions in urban housing and in the new factories. Child labor was not only legal, it was expected. Despite its economic successes, the Industrial Revolution was not without serious problems.</p>\n"

Stanfield may have depicted the Temeraire, illuminated in the foreground and flying the British flag.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ambiguity was on Turner&rsquo;s mind when he began work on his painting, whose full title is&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up</em>,<em> 1838</em>. He was familiar with the namesake ship, HMS Temeraire, as were all Britons of the day. Temeraire was the hero of the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where Napoleon&#39;s forces were defeated, and which secured British naval dominance for the next century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the late 1830s, however, Temeraire was no longer relevant. After retiring from service in 1812 she was converted into a hulk, a ship that can float but not actually sail. She spent time as a prison ship, housing ship, and storage depot before she was finally decommissioned in 1838 and sent up the River Thames to a shipyard in London to be broken into scrap materials. That trip on the Thames was witnessed by Turner, who used it as inspiration for his famous painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Clash of Technology</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For many Britons, Temeraire was a powerful reminder of their nation&rsquo;s long history of military success and a living connection to the heroes of the Napoleonic Wars. Its disassembly signaled the end of an historical era. Turner celebrates Temeraire&rsquo;s heroic past, and he also depicts a technological change which had already begun to affect modern-day life in a more profound way than any battle.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rather than placing Temeraire in the middle of his canvas, Turner paints the warship near the left edge of the canvas. He uses shades of white, grey, and brown for the boat, making it look almost like a ghost ship. The mighty warship is being pulled along by a tiny black tugboat, whose steam engine is more than strong enough to control its larger counterpart. Turner transforms the scene into an allegory about how the new steam power of the Industrial Revolution quickly replaced history and tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Believe it or not, tugboats were so new that there wasn&rsquo;t even a word for what the little ship was doing to Temeraire. According to the&nbsp;Oxford English Dictionary, Turner&rsquo;s title for his painting is the first ever recorded use of the word &ldquo;tugged&rdquo; to describe a steamship pulling another boat.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to the inventive title, Turner included in the exhibition catalog the following lines of text, which he modified from a poem by Thomas Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ye Mariners of England&rdquo;:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The flag which braved the battle and the breeze<br />\n"
"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No long owns her</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This was literally true: Temeraire flies a white flag instead of the British flag, indicating it has been sold by the military to a private company. Furthermore, the poem acknowledges that the ship now has a different function. Temeraire used to be a warship, but no more.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Creative Adaptation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In 1838 Temeraire was towed approximately 55 miles from its coastal dock to a London shipyard, and untold numbers of Britons would have witnessed the ship&rsquo;s final journey. However, the Temeraire they saw only lightly resembled the mighty warship depicted by Turner. In reality her masts had already been removed, as had all other ornamentation and everything else of value on the ship&rsquo;s exterior and interior. Only her barren shell was tugged to London.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>In fact there would have been two steamships moving Temeraire, but Turner exercised his artistic creativity to capture the emotional impact of the sight. Contemporary viewers recognized that </span><em>The&nbsp;Fighting Temeraire</em><span>&nbsp;depicts an ideal image of the ship, rather than reality.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Strong contrast is also visible in the way Turner applied paint to the various portions of his canvas. Temeraire is highly detailed. If you were to stand inches away from the painting, you would clearly see miniscule things like individual windows, hanging ropes, and decorative designs on the exterior of the ship.&nbsp;<span>However, if you looked over to the sun and clouds you would see a heavy accumulation of paint clumped on the canvas, giving it a sense of chaos and spontaneity.</span><br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Artist as a Warship</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Turner thought <em>The Fighting Temeraire</em> was one of his more important works. He never sold it, instead keeping it in his studio along with many of his other canvases. When he died in 1851 he bequeathed it and the rest of the paintings he owned to the nation. It<em>&nbsp;</em>quickly became seen as an image of Britain&rsquo;s relationship to industrialization. Steam power has proved itself to be much stronger and more efficient than old technology, but that efficiency came with the cost of centuries of proud tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beyond its national importance,<em>&nbsp;The Fighting Temeraire</em>&nbsp;is also a personal reflection by the artist on his own career. Turner was 64 when he painted it. He&rsquo;d been exhibiting at the Royal Academy of Arts since he was 15, and became a member at age 24, later taking a position as Professor of Painting. However, the year before he painted&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire</em>&nbsp;Turner resigned his professorship, and largely lived in secrecy and seclusion.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although Turner remained one of the most famous artists in England until his death, by the late 1830s he may have thought he was being superseded by younger artists working in drastically different styles. He may have become nostalgic for the country he grew up in, compared to the one in which he then lived.&nbsp;<em>Rain, Steam, and Speed&nbsp;- The Great Western Railway</em>&nbsp;would reflect a similar interest in the changing British landscape several years later, focusing on the dynamic nature of technology.&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire</em>&nbsp;presents a mournful vision of what technology had replaced, for better or for worse.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Artist as a Warship</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Turner thought <em>The Fighting Temeraire</em> was one of his more important works. He never sold it, instead keeping it in his studio along with many of his other canvases. When he died in 1851 he bequeathed it and the rest of the paintings he owned to the nation. It<em>&nbsp;</em>quickly became seen as an image of Britain&rsquo;s relationship to industrialization. Steam power has proved itself to be much stronger and more efficient than old technology, but that efficiency came with the cost of centuries of proud tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beyond its national importance,<em>&nbsp;The Fighting Temeraire</em>&nbsp;is also a personal reflection by the artist on his own career. Turner was 64 when he painted it. He&rsquo;d been exhibiting at the Royal Academy of Arts since he was 15, and became a member at age 24, later taking a position as Professor of Painting. However, the year before he painted&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire</em>&nbsp;Turner resigned his professorship, and largely lived in secrecy and seclusion.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although Turner remained one of the most famous artists in England until his death, by the late 1830s he may have thought he was being superseded by younger artists working in drastically different styles. He may have become nostalgic for the country he grew up in, compared to the one in which he then lived.&nbsp;<em>Rain, Steam, and Speed&nbsp;- The Great Western Railway</em>&nbsp;would reflect a similar interest in the changing British landscape several years later, focusing on the dynamic nature of technology.&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire</em>&nbsp;presents a mournful vision of what technology had replaced, for better or for worse.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture? The style is a mixture of Moorish, Tartar, Gothic, and Chinese and all in stone and iron. It is a whim which has already cost &pound;700,000, and it is still not ﬁt to live in.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^1</code>&nbsp;Such was the verdict of the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich on the eclectic, exotic and sensuous Royal Pavilion at Brighton.</p>\n"

"<p>While not all the contemporary reactions to the Pavilion were critical,&nbsp;John Evans, for example, admired it for both its &quot;beauty&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;grandeur,&quot;​<code class=\"latex\">^2</code>​&nbsp;it was a building which provoked a predominantly critical response in Regency England (in political terms the period from 1811 to 1820 when George, Prince of Wales&mdash;future George IV&mdash;ruled in place of his ailing father George III; and in cultural terms up until the death of George IV in 1830).&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;New Brighton Guide</em>&nbsp;called it a&nbsp;&quot;masterpiece of bad taste&quot;&nbsp;while the&nbsp;Comtesse de Boigne declared it a&nbsp;&quot;mad-house.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^3</code>&nbsp;And when Queen Victoria first visited the Royal Pavilion in 1837, she noted,&nbsp;&quot;The Pavilion is a strange, odd, Chinese looking place, both outside and inside.

"<h3>The patron: the Prince Regent</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ostensible aesthetic randomness of the Pavilion is best comprehended as the material expression of the profligate and rebellious life of its extraordinary benefactor, the Prince Regent, the future George IV, undoubtedly the greatest royal patron of the arts since King Charles I. A man of easy wit and charm, as well as political indolence and questionable morals, the Prince was the touchstone of style for the fashion-conscious Georgian elite of the day. He first visited the seaside resort of Brighton in 1783 to benefit from its reputedly medicinal waters. Captivated by the picturesque promise of the area, the Prince purchased a &quot;superior farmhouse&quot;&nbsp;in 1786 and engaged the royal architect Henry Holland to convert this modest building into a Neo-classical &quot;marine pavilion&quot;&nbsp;fit for a royal personage at play. Under the influence of the Prince Regent, William Porden, Nash&rsquo;s assistant, added a large stables and riding school in the Indian-style which would be the decorative prototype for the &quot;Oriental&quot;&nbsp;incarnation of the Royal Pavilion by its&nbsp;principal architect, John Nash.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The architect: John Nash</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>John Nash was the perfect professional partner for the Pavilion&rsquo;s colorful patron. Subsequently criticised for an overly fashionable&nbsp;and reckless approach to architectural practice, and a resultant lack of purity in the finished product, Nash had planned Regent&rsquo;s Street and Regent&rsquo;s Park in London as a celebration of the rise of the new consumer classes.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Nash&rsquo;s vision for Brighton was informed by the Prince&rsquo;s aesthetic sensibilities and colorful personality and the architect&rsquo;s own experiences of the Picturesque (the beauty inherent in unspoilt nature, as first outlined by the artist William Gilpin), as well as the aquatints of &quot;hindoo&quot;&nbsp;architecture which appeared in the six-volume <em>Oriental Scenery</em> by the landscape painters Thomas and William Daniell at the end of the 18th century. The result was the so-called &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style, comprised of an assortment of architectural and design forms and motifs taken from Britain&rsquo;s colonial experience of the &quot;Orient.&quot;<br />\n"

"<p>Without denying the central agency of both the bold-thinking Nash and fashion-conscious Prince Regent in the design of the Royal Pavilion, the range and variety of architectural styles should be viewed within the context of a&nbsp;wider cultural tradition just then emerging. This exotic mad-house was a response to the early&nbsp;British Empire and its&nbsp;East India Company (a trading company established in 1600 with a&nbsp;fleet of ships and an army&nbsp;200,000 strong)&nbsp;that facillitated the rule of&nbsp;the Indian sub-continent for some two-hundred years and&nbsp;which&nbsp;shaped the British Empire.&nbsp;Here was trade from the East, a rich complex of cultural interchange, and a fascination for the &quot;Orient&quot;&nbsp;in its widest, and loosest, colonial meaning. As the architectural historian Ian Sutton has written, in the nineteenth-century, &quot;Both&nbsp;[architects] and their patrons were assailed by new temptations which they found difficult to resist.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^5</code></p>\n"

"<p>Both buildings pre-date the Pavilion. Moreover, juxtaposing a culturally alien interior to the exterior was not a new idea, and was in some sense&nbsp;a colonial interpretation of the cultures of the lands of Empire. Henry Holland&#39;s French Neo-classical Carlton House,&nbsp;1783&ndash;96&nbsp;in London, for example, boasted a fine Chinese drawing room. As such, Brighton Pavilion could be seen as the culmination of years of experimentation, rather than a one-off, stand-alone enterprise.<br />\n"

"<p>What does mark Brighton Pavilion out from the above examples, however, is its fundamental expression of Regency England Romanticism derived from the world of letters. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&rsquo;s opium-fuelled poem &quot;Kubla Khan,&quot; a classic of Romantic literature, published in 1816, famously speaks of the &quot;stately pleasure-dome&quot;&nbsp;of the Mongol ruler. One of the confidants of the Prince Regent was William Beckford, notorious hedonist and author of <em>Vathek: An Arabian Tale</em> (1786), whose earlier story of the outrageous ninth Caliph of Abassides was inspired by both<em> The Arabian Knights</em> and Horace Walpole&rsquo;s <em>The Castle of Oltranto</em> (1764), the latter being the novel that ushered in the Gothic genre in English literature. Indeed, the only true architectural pre-cursor to the Pavilion in this Romantic Gothic tradition is probably Walpole&rsquo;s own <em>Strawberry Hill</em> (see image below), an early example of Gothic Revival architecture, which applies &quot;Gothick&quot;&nbsp;forms and motifs in a similarly imaginative way as the Pavilion.<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Architecturally, the &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior owes much to C.P. Cockerell&rsquo;s Sezincote; however, there is in reality a significant difference which speaks of the changing fashions and the further development of exotic eclecticism in this period. Sezincote is hybridic: it retains a Neo-classical facade (the windows and bays), whilst sporting a turquoise onion-shaped Mughul dome and minarets, typical of Islamic architecture of the Indian sub-continent, such as the Taj Mahal, and features a Hindu-inspired garden, including a temple.</p>\n"

"&copy; British Library Board</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Pavilion&#39;s exterior, on the other hand, is more uniformly Mugul-flavored, albeit shot through with a generic sense of the &quot;Orient&quot;: namely&nbsp;the arabesque profusion of ten domes and ten minarets, supported by a cast iron frame, and the vertical thrust of the building, giving it a sense of lightness and airiness, an almost dream-like temporary tent-like quality, in opposition to the permanent horizontal-axised stout square-blockedness of Sezincote.<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Chinese&quot;&nbsp;interior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As for the interior of the Pavilion, while England&rsquo;s curiosity for Chinese culture pre-dates that of its interest in Indian civilization by almost a century, the former&rsquo;s application to the inside of Nash&rsquo;s building is complex, for we have in fact the Neo-classical, Chinese and Gothic at work together. The Entrance Hall (see image below), for instance, is symmetrically arranged, as per the Neo-classical; while the Long Gallery (see image above) contains a multitude of generic Chinese/Asian features (&quot;Chinoiserie&quot;), including the hexagonal lanterns, the silk tassels and the motif of bamboo and birds on the wallpaper, the work of interior decorator Frederick Crace.</p>\n"

"<h3>Making sense of a &lsquo;mad-house&rsquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Royal Pavilion at Brighton in all its apparent kaleidoscopic silliness, brashness, vitality, phantasamagoric contradictions and oppositions, references, and tries&mdash;though not always succeeds&mdash;to respond to the tastes of a new fashionable elite at home and to make sense (or not) of a new world of empire abroad. Indeed, in all its range and variety, as well as in its playful eccentricities, it is quite possibly the ultimate architectural manifestation of early nineteenth-century eclecticism, as well as being the material personification of a powerful Regency personality and his private architect. The history of architecture in Britain is all the richer as a result.</p>\n"

"<h3>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture?&quot;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture? The style is a mixture of Moorish, Tartar, Gothic, and Chinese and all in stone and iron. It is a whim which has already cost &pound;700,000, and it is still not ﬁt to live in.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^1</code>&nbsp;Such was the verdict of the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich on the eclectic, exotic and sensuous Royal Pavilion at Brighton.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While not all the contemporary reactions to the Pavilion were critical,&nbsp;John Evans, for example, admired it for both its &quot;beauty&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;grandeur,&quot;​<code class=\"latex\">^2</code>​&nbsp;it was a building which provoked a predominantly critical response in Regency England (in political terms the period from 1811 to 1820 when George, Prince of Wales&mdash;future George IV&mdash;ruled in place of his ailing father George III; and in cultural terms up until the death of George IV in 1830).&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;New Brighton Guide</em>&nbsp;called it a&nbsp;&quot;masterpiece of bad taste&quot;&nbsp;while the&nbsp;Comtesse de Boigne declared it a&nbsp;&quot;mad-house.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^3</code>&nbsp;And when Queen Victoria first visited the Royal Pavilion in 1837, she noted,&nbsp;&quot;The Pavilion is a strange, odd, Chinese looking place, both outside and inside. Most of the rooms are low, and I can see a morsel of the sea, from one of my sitting room windows.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^4</code></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The patron: the Prince Regent</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ostensible aesthetic randomness of the Pavilion is best comprehended as the material expression of the profligate and rebellious life of its extraordinary benefactor, the Prince Regent, the future George IV, undoubtedly the greatest royal patron of the arts since King Charles I. A man of easy wit and charm, as well as political indolence and questionable morals, the Prince was the touchstone of style for the fashion-conscious Georgian elite of the day. He first visited the seaside resort of Brighton in 1783 to benefit from its reputedly medicinal waters. Captivated by the picturesque promise of the area, the Prince purchased a &quot;superior farmhouse&quot;&nbsp;in 1786 and engaged the royal architect Henry Holland to convert this modest building into a Neo-classical &quot;marine pavilion&quot;&nbsp;fit for a royal personage at play. Under the influence of the Prince Regent, William Porden, Nash&rsquo;s assistant, added a large stables and riding school in the Indian-style which would be the decorative prototype for the &quot;Oriental&quot;&nbsp;incarnation of the Royal Pavilion by its&nbsp;principal architect, John Nash.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The architect: John Nash</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>John Nash was the perfect professional partner for the Pavilion&rsquo;s colorful patron. Subsequently criticised for an overly fashionable&nbsp;and reckless approach to architectural practice, and a resultant lack of purity in the finished product, Nash had planned Regent&rsquo;s Street and Regent&rsquo;s Park in London as a celebration of the rise of the new consumer classes.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Nash&rsquo;s vision for Brighton was informed by the Prince&rsquo;s aesthetic sensibilities and colorful personality and the architect&rsquo;s own experiences of the Picturesque (the beauty inherent in unspoilt nature, as first outlined by the artist William Gilpin), as well as the aquatints of &quot;hindoo&quot;&nbsp;architecture which appeared in the six-volume <em>Oriental Scenery</em> by the landscape painters Thomas and William Daniell at the end of the 18th century. The result was the so-called &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style, comprised of an assortment of architectural and design forms and motifs taken from Britain&rsquo;s colonial experience of the &quot;Orient.&quot;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>Without denying the central agency of both the bold-thinking Nash and fashion-conscious Prince Regent in the design of the Royal Pavilion, the range and variety of architectural styles should be viewed within the context of a&nbsp;wider cultural tradition just then emerging. This exotic mad-house was a response to the early&nbsp;British Empire and its&nbsp;East India Company (a trading company established in 1600 with a&nbsp;fleet of ships and an army&nbsp;200,000 strong)&nbsp;that facillitated the rule of&nbsp;the Indian sub-continent for some two-hundred years and&nbsp;which&nbsp;shaped the British Empire.&nbsp;Here was trade from the East, a rich complex of cultural interchange, and a fascination for the &quot;Orient&quot;&nbsp;in its widest, and loosest, colonial meaning.

"<p>Both buildings pre-date the Pavilion. Moreover, juxtaposing a culturally alien interior to the exterior was not a new idea, and was in some sense&nbsp;a colonial interpretation of the cultures of the lands of Empire. Henry Holland&#39;s French Neo-classical Carlton House,&nbsp;1783&ndash;96&nbsp;in London, for example, boasted a fine Chinese drawing room. As such, Brighton Pavilion could be seen as the culmination of years of experimentation, rather than a one-off, stand-alone enterprise.<br />\n"

"<p>What does mark Brighton Pavilion out from the above examples, however, is its fundamental expression of Regency England Romanticism derived from the world of letters. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&rsquo;s opium-fuelled poem &quot;Kubla Khan,&quot; a classic of Romantic literature, published in 1816, famously speaks of the &quot;stately pleasure-dome&quot;&nbsp;of the Mongol ruler. One of the confidants of the Prince Regent was William Beckford, notorious hedonist and author of <em>Vathek: An Arabian Tale</em> (1786), whose earlier story of the outrageous ninth Caliph of Abassides was inspired by both<em> The Arabian Knights</em> and Horace Walpole&rsquo;s <em>The Castle of Oltranto</em> (1764), the latter being the novel that ushered in the Gothic genre in English literature. Indeed, the only true architectural pre-cursor to the Pavilion in this Romantic Gothic tradition is probably Walpole&rsquo;s own <em>Strawberry Hill</em> (see image below), an early example of Gothic Revival architecture, which applies &quot;Gothick&quot;&nbsp;forms and motifs in a similarly imaginative way as the Pavilion.<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Architecturally, the &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior owes much to C.P. Cockerell&rsquo;s Sezincote; however, there is in reality a significant difference which speaks of the changing fashions and the further development of exotic eclecticism in this period. Sezincote is hybridic: it retains a Neo-classical facade (the windows and bays), whilst sporting a turquoise onion-shaped Mughul dome and minarets, typical of Islamic architecture of the Indian sub-continent, such as the Taj Mahal, and features a Hindu-inspired garden, including a temple.</p>\n"

"&copy; British Library Board</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Pavilion&#39;s exterior, on the other hand, is more uniformly Mugul-flavored, albeit shot through with a generic sense of the &quot;Orient&quot;: namely&nbsp;the arabesque profusion of ten domes and ten minarets, supported by a cast iron frame, and the vertical thrust of the building, giving it a sense of lightness and airiness, an almost dream-like temporary tent-like quality, in opposition to the permanent horizontal-axised stout square-blockedness of Sezincote.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The &quot;Chinese&quot;&nbsp;interior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As for the interior of the Pavilion, while England&rsquo;s curiosity for Chinese culture pre-dates that of its interest in Indian civilization by almost a century, the former&rsquo;s application to the inside of Nash&rsquo;s building is complex, for we have in fact the Neo-classical, Chinese and Gothic at work together. The Entrance Hall (see image below), for instance, is symmetrically arranged, as per the Neo-classical; while the Long Gallery (see image above) contains a multitude of generic Chinese/Asian features (&quot;Chinoiserie&quot;), including the hexagonal lanterns, the silk tassels and the motif of bamboo and birds on the wallpaper, the work of interior decorator Frederick Crace.</p>\n"

"<h3>Making sense of a &lsquo;mad-house&rsquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Royal Pavilion at Brighton in all its apparent kaleidoscopic silliness, brashness, vitality, phantasamagoric contradictions and oppositions, references, and tries&mdash;though not always succeeds&mdash;to respond to the tastes of a new fashionable elite at home and to make sense (or not) of a new world of empire abroad. Indeed, in all its range and variety, as well as in its playful eccentricities, it is quite possibly the ultimate architectural manifestation of early nineteenth-century eclecticism, as well as being the material personification of a powerful Regency personality and his private architect. The history of architecture in Britain is all the richer as a result.</p>\n"

"<p>A key idea of the Age of Enlightenment&mdash;that empirical observation grounded in science and reason could best advance society&mdash;is expressed by the faces of the individuals in Joseph Wright of Derby&rsquo;s <em>A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Age of Enlightenment</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wright&rsquo;s painting encapsulates in one moment the Enlightenment, a philosophical shift in the eighteenth century away from traditional religious models of the universe and toward an empirical, scientific approach. It is important to note the term given this new way of thinking. &ldquo;Enlightenment&rdquo; indicates an active process, undertaken by an individual by group.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The age of Enlightenment is most closely associated with scientists and inventors, but writers and artists also played major roles. They helped spread enlightenment concepts via the written word and printed image, and inspired others to think rationally about the world in which they lived. The provincial English painter Joseph Wright of Derby became the unofficial artist of the Enlightenment, depicting scientists and philosophers in ways previously reserved for Biblical heroes and Greek gods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Joseph Wright of Derby</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Joseph Wright of Derby was born in the town of Derby in central England, and save for short stints in Liverpool and London, lived in that city his entire life. He was known even during his lifetime as Joseph Wright of Derby, to distinguish him from another artist of the same name. Even though Wright of Derby was the more talented of the two, he was stuck with the geographical identifier on his name.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other than Thomas Gainsborough, who spent much of his career in the high-society resort town of Bath, Wright was the most prominent English painter of the eighteenth century to spend the majority of his career outside of London. Operating without the constraints of the mainstream London art world, Wright was free to explore a general interest in science with his friends, a group that included Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles) and other members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, an informal learned society which met to discuss scientific topics of the day.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wright was known for his deft depiction of the contrasts between light and dark, also known as chiaroscuro, and his unflinching portrayal of the true personalities of his subjects. This trait caused his downfall when he attempted to work as a portraitist&mdash;few wanted a portrait, warts and all.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Intensity of Scientific Discovery</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 1760s Wright began to explore the traditional boundaries of various genres of painting. According to the French academies of art, the highest genre of painting was history painting, which depicted Biblical or classical subjects to demonstrate a moral lesson. This high regard for history panting was adopted by the British&mdash;Benjamin West&rsquo;s <em>The Death of General Wolfe</em> is a prominent example.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Johan Joseph Zoffany, The Gore Family with George, third Earl Cowper, c. 1775, oil on canvas (Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb2f8ee6606f51a0d4007757c29a51b66a8dbb01.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Johan Joseph Zoffany, <em>The Gore Family with George, third Earl Cowper</em>, c. 1775, oil on canvas (Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wright took this noble, aggrandizing method of portraying events and applied it to a composition showing a contemporary subject in <em>A Philosopher Lecturing at the Orrery</em>. Rather than a moral of leadership or heroism, this painting&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral&rdquo; is the pursuit of scientific knowledge. With its collection of non-idealized men, women, boys, and girls informally arranged in a small physical space around a central organizing point, Wright&rsquo;s painting mimics the compositional structure of a conversation piece (an informal group portrait) like Zoffany&#39;s <em>Gore Family</em> (above), but with the dramatic lighting and scale expected from a major religious scene.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In effect, <em>A Philosopher Lecturing at the Orrery </em>does depict a moment of religious epiphany. Much like the central figure in Caravaggio&rsquo;s<em> Calling of Saint Matthew </em>(below), the figures listening to the philosopher&rsquo;s lecture in Wright&rsquo;s painting are experiencing conversion...to science.</p>\n"

Each planet, with its moons, is a sphere attached to a swing arm which allows it to rotate around the sun when cranked by hand. When in motion, the orrery depicts the orbits of each planet, as well as their relative relationship to each other. The orrery depicted by Wright has large metal rings which can simulate eclipses, and give the model a striking and exciting three-dimensionality.</p>\n"

Most likely the man standing and taking notes is Wright&rsquo;s friend Peter Perez Burdett, and the man seated at the far right may be Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers, the initial owner of the work.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Several identities have been proposed for the philosopher delivering the lecture. The most tempting theory is that his face is modeled on that of Sir Isaac Newton, the great English scientist whose work helped herald in the Enlightenment. Another possibility is that it is a member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham.</p>\n"

That responsibility falls on the paintings strong internal light source, the lamp that takes the role of the sun. Wright mimics Baroque artists like Caravaggio, who inserted strong light sources in otherwise dark compositions to create dramatic effect. Most of these earlier works were Christian subjects, and the light sources were often simple candles. Wright flips the script with his scientific subject matter. The gas lamp which acts as the sun pulls double duty in the painting. It illuminates the scene, allowing the viewer to clearly see the figures within, and it symbolizes the active enlightenment in which those figures are participating.</span></p>\n"

With its collection of non-idealized men, women, boys, and girls informally arranged in a small physical space around a central organizing point, Wright&rsquo;s painting mimics the compositional structure of a conversation piece (an informal group portrait) like Zoffany&#39;s <em>Gore Family</em> (above), but with the dramatic lighting and scale expected from a major religious scene.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In effect, <em>A Philosopher Lecturing at the Orrery </em>does depict a moment of religious epiphany. Much like the central figure in Caravaggio&rsquo;s<em> Calling of Saint Matthew </em>(below), the figures listening to the philosopher&rsquo;s lecture in Wright&rsquo;s painting are experiencing conversion...to science.</p>\n"

When in motion, the orrery depicts the orbits of each planet, as well as their relative relationship to each other. The orrery depicted by Wright has large metal rings which can simulate eclipses, and give the model a striking and exciting three-dimensionality.</p>\n"

Most of these earlier works were Christian subjects, and the light sources were often simple candles. Wright flips the script with his scientific subject matter. The gas lamp which acts as the sun pulls double duty in the painting. It illuminates the scene, allowing the viewer to clearly see the figures within, and it symbolizes the active enlightenment in which those figures are participating.</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The way of the flesh and the way of the spirit</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Dutch painter Pieter Aertsen, who worked for many years in Antwerp, was later renowned for his life-size market scenes with exuberant still life elements. Many scholars have commented on the bold originality of Aertsen&rsquo;s compositions, and rightly so. In the sixteenth century, religious or mythological scenes usually occupied pride of place in works of art, while everyday objects were considered mere accessories. In this and other&nbsp;roughly contemporary works like <em>Christ in the House of Mary and Martha</em>&nbsp;(below), Aertsen has deliberately reversed this formula. He gave all the attention to the accessories, which seem to spill out of the picture and into the viewer&rsquo;s own space.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Christ with Mary and Martha, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ccc4b4ff34ac21f9c91e6a330370a3d1f5382ac0.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>Christ in the House of&nbsp;Mary and Martha</em>, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen certainly seems to have been the first to foreground meat in a prestigious, costly oil painting on a monumental size. However, he may also have been inspired to upend traditional hierarchies of subject matter (giving most of the attention to the still-life elements) by the painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden&#39;s <em>Ecce homo </em>scene<em>&nbsp;</em>(<em>Ecce homo</em>&nbsp;means &quot;behold the man&quot; and refers to&nbsp;Pontius Pilate presenting&nbsp;the beaten Christ crowned with&nbsp;thorns before his crucifixion). Leyden, in <em>Christ Presented the People</em> (below),&nbsp;shows a great market square with a crowd in the foreground, while Christ himself has been relegated to the background.</p>\n"

And indeed, in Aertsen&rsquo;s picture, the crossed herring on a pewter plate just above the ox&rsquo;s head&mdash;fish was associated with Lent, a period when the faithful abstained from meat&mdash;seem to point in the direction of the holy scene in the background, beyond the meat.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other scholars have suggested that Aertsen&rsquo;s inversion of traditional hierarchies was inspired by sources from classical antiquity&mdash;though perhaps equally moralizing.

Land being in short supply, the city council forced the prestigious order of Augustinian nuns who ran the St. Elisabeth&rsquo;s hospital&nbsp;to sell their property at a loss. But the city bought too much acreage, so the surplus was sold to one Gillis van Schoonbeke, a notorious real estate developer whose activities were so unpopular that they even caused riots.

"<h3>The way of the flesh and the way of the spirit</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Dutch painter Pieter Aertsen, who worked for many years in Antwerp, was later renowned for his life-size market scenes with exuberant still life elements. Many scholars have commented on the bold originality of Aertsen&rsquo;s compositions, and rightly so. In the sixteenth century, religious or mythological scenes usually occupied pride of place in works of art, while everyday objects were considered mere accessories. In this and other&nbsp;roughly contemporary works like <em>Christ in the House of Mary and Martha</em>&nbsp;(below), Aertsen has deliberately reversed this formula. He gave all the attention to the accessories, which seem to spill out of the picture and into the viewer&rsquo;s own space.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Christ with Mary and Martha, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ccc4b4ff34ac21f9c91e6a330370a3d1f5382ac0.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>Christ in the House of&nbsp;Mary and Martha</em>, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen certainly seems to have been the first to foreground meat in a prestigious, costly oil painting on a monumental size. However, he may also have been inspired to upend traditional hierarchies of subject matter (giving most of the attention to the still-life elements) by the painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden&#39;s <em>Ecce homo </em>scene<em>&nbsp;</em>(<em>Ecce homo</em>&nbsp;means &quot;behold the man&quot; and refers to&nbsp;Pontius Pilate presenting&nbsp;the beaten Christ crowned with&nbsp;thorns before his crucifixion). Leyden, in <em>Christ Presented the People</em> (below),&nbsp;shows a great market square with a crowd in the foreground, while Christ himself has been relegated to the background.</p>\n"

And indeed, in Aertsen&rsquo;s picture, the crossed herring on a pewter plate just above the ox&rsquo;s head&mdash;fish was associated with Lent, a period when the faithful abstained from meat&mdash;seem to point in the direction of the holy scene in the background, beyond the meat.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other scholars have suggested that Aertsen&rsquo;s inversion of traditional hierarchies was inspired by sources from classical antiquity&mdash;though perhaps equally moralizing. The Roman satirist Juvenal, for example, chastised the lovers of lavish meals in his eleventh satire, lambasting their fondness for &ldquo;stinking meat shops&rdquo; instead of plain, wholesome food. Closer to Aertsen&rsquo;s own time, the philosopher Desiderius Erasmus&nbsp;used irony to make a point: undesirable behavior is heaped with praise&nbsp;to throw its negative aspects into sharp relief, while the reader is treated to a good laugh.

Land being in short supply, the city council forced the prestigious order of Augustinian nuns who ran the St. Elisabeth&rsquo;s hospital&nbsp;to sell their property at a loss. But the city bought too much acreage, so the surplus was sold to one Gillis van Schoonbeke, a notorious real estate developer whose activities were so unpopular that they even caused riots. At one point imperial troops had to be called in to stop the violence.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Given this background, the painting with its layered messages&mdash;all of which warn against greed and excess&mdash;must have seemed emblematic of the rapid social changes overtaking the city, which experienced unprecedented growth thanks to its booming international trade. Traditional groups and values, such as the charitable nuns and their inviolable property, or the venerable butchers and their hereditary rights, were under fire from powerful, wealthy entrepreneurs and the city&rsquo;s desire for economic growth, a matter of concern for all citizens.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>A young woman in a bejeweled dress with a stiff lace collar gazes confidently out of a simply-framed, bust-length portrait placed at the very center of a large canvas. &nbsp;Her name is Marie de&#39; Medici, daughter of the Grandduke of Tuscany.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Jupiter&rsquo;s fierce eagle, seen in the top left corner, looks away from the couple and clenches its lightening bolts in its talons. In contrast, Juno&rsquo;s tamed peacock looks at the divine couple, while his mate cranes her neck to look at the portrait. A pink silk ribbon binds them together. The peahen perches on Juno&rsquo;s chariot, directly above a golden relief of Cupid who balances a yoke-shaped garland (a symbol of marriage) on his shoulders as he playfully dances on the wings of a proud eagle. The message is clear: even the king of the gods can be subdued by love. Following Jupiter&rsquo;s lead, Henry must also turn his attention to marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>However, this match is about politics as well as love. Behind Henry stands the personification of France, wearing a blue silk garment embroidered with gold fleur-de-lys (the coat of arms of the French monarchy) and an elaborate plumed helmet encircled by a gold crown. She gently touches Henry&rsquo;s shoulder and whispers in his ear, assuring him that a match with the Medici princess is indeed good for the kingdom. France urges Henry to turn away from the field of battle, the aftermath of which is visible in the burning town in the background, and attend to hearth and home, for domestic matters are no less important to the survival of the monarchy than military exploits. Henry obliges; his helmet and shield&mdash;now the playthings of two tender cherubs&mdash;lie at his feet. &nbsp;</p>\n"

In both scale and subject matter, this cycle is unprecedented. Not only is it unique in its dedication to the major life events of a queen, but it also includes events that were both quite recent and quite humiliating. After Henry was assassinated in 1610, Marie&mdash;acting as regent for their young son, Louis XIII&mdash;ruled the kingdom of France for seven years. The position suited her; but many French nobles begrudged her power. Divisions in the court, including tensions with her own son, led to Marie&rsquo;s exile from the Paris in 1617. The commission of the biographical cycle marked her reconciliation with Louis and her return to the capital city in 1620. It vindicated her reign as the queen of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"

This, at least, is the message she wished to convey and she worked closely with her advisors and Rubens to ensure her story was told as she saw fit. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <em>Presentation of the Portrait</em> forms part of this agenda; it is an idealized portrayal of the conclusion in April of 1600 of marriage negotiations that were two years in the making. The painting presents Henry&rsquo;s bethrothal to Marie de Medici as a union ordained by the gods, counseled by France, and inspired by Marie&rsquo;s beauty and virtues. In reality, the merits of the union were extolled not by a soft-haired, fleshy Cupid but by the alliance&rsquo;s French and Italian proponents, one of whom reported that the portrait presented by the Florentine negotiators &ldquo;pleased His Majesty exceedingly.&rdquo; Henry, for his part, was distracted from the negotiations by his new mistress, whom he had promised to marry. Nevertheless, he recognized the political and financial necessity of the Medici marriage. When his advisor announced the finalization of the marriage contract, Henry exclaimed: &quot;By God, let it be; there is nothing to be done about it, because for the good of my kingdom and my peoples, you say that I must be married, so I simply must be.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Cupid and King Henry discussing the portrait of Marie de Medici (detail), Peter Paul Rubens, The Presentation of the Portrait of Marie de’ Medici, c. 1622-1625, oil on canvas, 394 x 295 cm (Musée du Louvre)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13309b24d7b87bf2b9c8b32cf7be57d65a03e1c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Cupid and King Henry discussing the portrait of Marie de Medici (detail), Peter Paul Rubens,<em> The Presentation of the Portrait of Marie de&rsquo; Medici</em>, c. 1622-1625, oil on canvas, 394 x 295 cm (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre)</span></span>For Henry, a Protestant who had converted to Catholicism upon ascending to the throne in 1593, a Catholic wife would assuage any concerns about his loyalty to the Catholic Church in France. Additionally, Marie&rsquo;s hefty dowry eased Henry&rsquo;s large debt to the Medici, major financial backers of his military activities. And, perhaps most importantly, Henry was nearing the age of 50 and had yet to father an heir, putting France&rsquo;s future stability in danger. A fruitful union with Marie was key to this stability. In this matter, the 27-year old Marie did not disappoint, giving birth to a son one year after the wedding, and five additional children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Rubens asserts Marie&rsquo;s successful role as wife and mother by establishing a dominant vertical axis through the center of the composition from Juno, with her exposed, full breasts, through Marie&rsquo;s portrait to the chubby cherub directly below. Of all of the figures in the painting, Marie and the cherub are the only ones who look out at the viewer, pointedly reaffirming the centrality of Marie de&rsquo; Medici and of her royal progeny to the future of France. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The theme of peace, which runs throughout the cycle, was indeed furthered not only in France but in Europe by the marriage alliances brokered by Marie for her children: Louis XIII married a daughter of the Spanish king, her daughter Elisabeth married the heir to the Spanish throne (the future King Philip IV), and her daughter Henrietta married Charles I of England.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Marie&rsquo;s truce with her son Louis however was short lived and she died in exile in 1631. Despite the challenges of her life as she struggled to regain the power and influence she once had, Marie de&rsquo; Medici lived to hear herself proclaimed mother of three sovereigns, certainly an impressive legacy for the orphaned daughter of the Grandduke of Tuscany. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Cupid&#39;s arrow hits its mark</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A young woman in a bejeweled dress with a stiff lace collar gazes confidently out of a simply-framed, bust-length portrait placed at the very center of a large canvas. &nbsp;Her name is Marie de&#39; Medici, daughter of the Grandduke of Tuscany.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ancient gods of marriage and love&mdash;Hymen and Amor (Cupid), to the left and right, respectively&mdash;hover in midair as they present this portrait to Henry IV, the king of France. Hymen holds in his left hand a flaming torch, symbolizing the ardor of love, while Cupid extols the virtues of the Medici princess. Cupid&rsquo;s arrow has hit its mark; the king is smitten. He gazes up in gratitude, his left hand extended as he expresses his delight in his bride-to-be.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Jupiter&rsquo;s fierce eagle, seen in the top left corner, looks away from the couple and clenches its lightening bolts in its talons. In contrast, Juno&rsquo;s tamed peacock looks at the divine couple, while his mate cranes her neck to look at the portrait. A pink silk ribbon binds them together. The peahen perches on Juno&rsquo;s chariot, directly above a golden relief of Cupid who balances a yoke-shaped garland (a symbol of marriage) on his shoulders as he playfully dances on the wings of a proud eagle. The message is clear: even the king of the gods can be subdued by love. Following Jupiter&rsquo;s lead, Henry must also turn his attention to marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>However, this match is about politics as well as love. Behind Henry stands the personification of France, wearing a blue silk garment embroidered with gold fleur-de-lys (the coat of arms of the French monarchy) and an elaborate plumed helmet encircled by a gold crown. She gently touches Henry&rsquo;s shoulder and whispers in his ear, assuring him that a match with the Medici princess is indeed good for the kingdom. France urges Henry to turn away from the field of battle, the aftermath of which is visible in the burning town in the background, and attend to hearth and home, for domestic matters are no less important to the survival of the monarchy than military exploits. Henry obliges; his helmet and shield&mdash;now the playthings of two tender cherubs&mdash;lie at his feet. &nbsp;</p>\n"

In both scale and subject matter, this cycle is unprecedented. Not only is it unique in its dedication to the major life events of a queen, but it also includes events that were both quite recent and quite humiliating. After Henry was assassinated in 1610, Marie&mdash;acting as regent for their young son, Louis XIII&mdash;ruled the kingdom of France for seven years. The position suited her; but many French nobles begrudged her power. Divisions in the court, including tensions with her own son, led to Marie&rsquo;s exile from the Paris in 1617. The commission of the biographical cycle marked her reconciliation with Louis and her return to the capital city in 1620. It vindicated her reign as the queen of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"

This, at least, is the message she wished to convey and she worked closely with her advisors and Rubens to ensure her story was told as she saw fit. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <em>Presentation of the Portrait</em> forms part of this agenda; it is an idealized portrayal of the conclusion in April of 1600 of marriage negotiations that were two years in the making. The painting presents Henry&rsquo;s bethrothal to Marie de Medici as a union ordained by the gods, counseled by France, and inspired by Marie&rsquo;s beauty and virtues. In reality, the merits of the union were extolled not by a soft-haired, fleshy Cupid but by the alliance&rsquo;s French and Italian proponents, one of whom reported that the portrait presented by the Florentine negotiators &ldquo;pleased His Majesty exceedingly.&rdquo; Henry, for his part, was distracted from the negotiations by his new mistress, whom he had promised to marry. Nevertheless, he recognized the political and financial necessity of the Medici marriage. When his advisor announced the finalization of the marriage contract, Henry exclaimed: &quot;By God, let it be; there is nothing to be done about it, because for the good of my kingdom and my peoples, you say that I must be married, so I simply must be.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13309b24d7b87bf2b9c8b32cf7be57d65a03e1c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Cupid and King Henry discussing the portrait of Marie de Medici (detail), Peter Paul Rubens,<em> The Presentation of the Portrait of Marie de&rsquo; Medici</em>, c. 1622-1625, oil on canvas, 394 x 295 cm (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre)</span></span>For Henry, a Protestant who had converted to Catholicism upon ascending to the throne in 1593, a Catholic wife would assuage any concerns about his loyalty to the Catholic Church in France. Additionally, Marie&rsquo;s hefty dowry eased Henry&rsquo;s large debt to the Medici, major financial backers of his military activities. And, perhaps most importantly, Henry was nearing the age of 50 and had yet to father an heir, putting France&rsquo;s future stability in danger. A fruitful union with Marie was key to this stability. In this matter, the 27-year old Marie did not disappoint, giving birth to a son one year after the wedding, and five additional children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Rubens asserts Marie&rsquo;s successful role as wife and mother by establishing a dominant vertical axis through the center of the composition from Juno, with her exposed, full breasts, through Marie&rsquo;s portrait to the chubby cherub directly below. Of all of the figures in the painting, Marie and the cherub are the only ones who look out at the viewer, pointedly reaffirming the centrality of Marie de&rsquo; Medici and of her royal progeny to the future of France. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The theme of peace, which runs throughout the cycle, was indeed furthered not only in France but in Europe by the marriage alliances brokered by Marie for her children: Louis XIII married a daughter of the Spanish king, her daughter Elisabeth married the heir to the Spanish throne (the future King Philip IV), and her daughter Henrietta married Charles I of England.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Marie&rsquo;s truce with her son Louis however was short lived and she died in exile in 1631. Despite the challenges of her life as she struggled to regain the power and influence she once had, Marie de&rsquo; Medici lived to hear herself proclaimed mother of three sovereigns, certainly an impressive legacy for the orphaned daughter of the Grandduke of Tuscany. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Add-on (glosses)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the moment we learn to read as a child we are told not to write in our books. Still, we often do, especially when we use the book for school. If it is not our own copy, we may write with pencil, so that our personal thoughts may be removed after use. Medieval readers had no problem writing in the margins, and apparently had no qualms about using permanent ink. In fact, it is hard to point out a manuscript that does not contain any such add-ons.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some of these notes (or glosses) were extensive, and the scribe had to extend the margins to accommodate them. The glosses seen here provide an alternative meaning (<em>mixta vel bibita</em>), a clarification (<em>posita</em>) and an encouragement to check something out in another book (the letter &quot;r&quot; for &quot;require&quot;).</p>\n"

Students are known to have used them to take down notes in the classroom or when they were studying a text at home. Few of them survive today. Not only were they easy to lose, but many of them were actually thrown out, similar to the fate of our modern day &quot;sticky notes.&quot;&nbsp;In some manuscripts they survive because they were tucked in between the pages, as seen here.</span></p>\n"

However, following the Spanish Conquest (c. 1534) they quickly appropriated European painting conventions.

"<p>Atahualpa was the last Sapa Inka before the Spanish Conquest began around 1534. As the inscription on the Brooklyn portrait makes explicit, he was the illegitimate son of Sapa Inka Huayna Capac who&nbsp;died of smallpox in 1528.&nbsp;Although Atahualpa ultimately prevailed in&nbsp;a battle with his elder brother Huascar (born of a different mother) for control of the Inka empire&mdash;the timing of the victory was unfortunate. &nbsp;While the civil war raged, the Spanish conquistador Franciso Pizarro, who had landed in present-day Ecuador on his third expedition to the Americas, made his way southward along the western coast of the continent, pillaging and murdering as he traveled. In November of 1523, Atahualpa was celebrating his victory in the city of Cajamarca awaiting the arrival of his prisoner, his brother&nbsp;Huascar. &nbsp;He had learned of Pizarro&rsquo;s expedition party but believed a retinue of less than two hundred men posed little threat. On November 16 Atahualpa, sumptuously attired, rode into the plaza of Cajamarca atop a luxurious litter (a platform for passengers&nbsp;carried by people)&nbsp;accompanied by high ranking Inka nobles and several thousand guards. &nbsp;He was met by the Dominican friar Vicente de Valverde and an interpreter. &nbsp;After a tense exchange in which Atahualpa threw to the ground a book of Catholic prayers offered to him by Valverde, the friar called out to the Spaniards who had hidden themselves, their mounts and artillery in the buildings surrounding the plaza. Pizarro signaled his men to charge, and in the ambush that followed several thousand Andeans were massacred and Atahualpa was taken prisoner. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In captivity, Atahualpa quickly discovered the Spaniards&rsquo; lust for silver and gold. He offered Pizarro an impressive ransom in exchange for his freedom, promising to fill a room approximately 6.2m x 4.8m to half its height (2.5 meters) with gold objects and the same room twice over with silver objects. For the next eight months, gold and silver streamed into Cajamarca from across the empire. Beginning in June the Spaniards began melting down the cache of treasure and divvying up the spoils. After the ransom had been melted and dispersed&mdash;and in response to mounting pressure among the expedition party&mdash;Pizarro had Atahualpa executed on July 26, 1533, by garroting (a method of execution by which a tightened metal collar results in strangulation). &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><strong>1.&nbsp;<span>What causes a star to form? What causes it to die?</span></strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Answer: </strong>A star forms in a huge cloud of gas and dust. Over time, gravity causes the cloud to contract. As the gas becomes denser, the pressure and temperature increase. As the cloud pulls in more gas and dust, its mass, pressure, and temperature continue to increase until nuclear fusion begins. The star shines through nuclear fusion until it runs out of fuel and dies.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Hayden Planetarium Director Neil deGrasse Tyson advised DC Comics on an episode in which Superman uses a powerful telescope to watch the destruction of his home planet Krypton. Is it really possible to look back in time by looking through a telescope? Why or why not? Why did Dr. Tyson suggest a star 27 light-years away?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, whenever you view an object in space, you&rsquo;re looking back in time &mdash; and the farther the object, the further back in time you&rsquo;re looking. That&rsquo;s because light takes time to travel from that object to your telescope, and you see the object as it appeared when light left that object. All the stars we see are light-years away, so we see them as they looked years ago. Dr. Tyson chose a star that was 27 light-years away because he predicted that Superman would be about 27 years old, and he left the planet as a baby.</p>\n"

"<p><strong>1.&nbsp;<span>What causes a star to form? What causes it to die?</span></strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Answer: </strong>A star forms in a huge cloud of gas and dust. Over time, gravity causes the cloud to contract. As the gas becomes denser, the pressure and temperature increase. As the cloud pulls in more gas and dust, its mass, pressure, and temperature continue to increase until nuclear fusion begins. The star shines through nuclear fusion until it runs out of fuel and dies.</p>\n"

"<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Hayden Planetarium Director Neil deGrasse Tyson advised DC Comics on an episode in which Superman uses a powerful telescope to watch the destruction of his home planet Krypton. Is it really possible to look back in time by looking through a telescope? Why or why not? Why did Dr. Tyson suggest a star 27 light-years away?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, whenever you view an object in space, you&rsquo;re looking back in time &mdash; and the farther the object, the further back in time you&rsquo;re looking. That&rsquo;s because light takes time to travel from that object to your telescope, and you see the object as it appeared when light left that object. All the stars we see are light-years away, so we see them as they looked years ago. 博士 Tyson chose a star that was 27 light-years away because he predicted that Superman would be about 27 years old, and he left the planet as a baby.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The vast geographic and environmental diversity of the North American continent has allowed one of the most culturally diverse regions on the planet to emerge.&nbsp;Societies across the continent have developed beautiful and complex material worlds that reflect the character and personality of their territories. Native North American peoples have responded to the universal problems of life in individual and ingenious ways, making best use of their natural resources to build strong and expressive communities. Here objects from the Museum&rsquo;s collection illustrate the ways in which separate Native American cultures have lived through a colonial period of immense social and environmental upheaval over the last three hundred years.<br />\n"

These ancient people were followed by Archaic hunters from 8000-1000 B.C.E. who exploited the new animal and plant resources of a warming climate, following the end of the ice-age, using specialized tools.&nbsp;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span>After the Archaic period came the Woodland peoples, from about 800 B.C.E., who lived in settled communities, hunting, fishing and gathering and cultivating plants. Large earthworks, such as those of the Ohio Hopewell culture (from about 100 B.C.E. to C.E.&nbsp;600), were created for religious, economic and defensive purposes.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>European colonization</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the time of European contact in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there would have probably been between two and ten million Native inhabitants.&nbsp;They were incredibly<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Head-dress previously owned by Chief Yellow Calf from Ethete, Wyoming, early 20th century, immature tail feathers of a golden eagle, horse hair, beads, ermine, cloth, Arapaho, 75 cm high © The Trustees of the British Museum\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8ebd3d94d7897a6af1bcf1c5eff86a7d498d1cd9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Head-dress,</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;early 20th century, Arapaho,&nbsp;immature tail feathers of a golden eagle, horse hair, beads, ermine, cloth, 75 cm high, Wyoming&nbsp;&copy; Trustees of the British Museum</span></span>diverse, living as distinct nations with distinct traditions and speaking different&nbsp;languages. European colonization and the expansion of the United States brought diseases and warfare that killed most of the native population. Bison, on which many depended for food, clothing, housing and tools, were hunted almost to extinction by commercial hunters. Further hardship came as many were forced to live in reservations.&nbsp;Continuing conflict culminated in the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 when United States troops massacred hundreds of Lakota after they had surrendered.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today, between two and three million people of native descent live in Canada and the United States of America. They are grouped into more than 1000 bands, tribes or nations all possessing their own oral literatures and histories; their survival and continued vibrancy a testament to the enduring strength of their traditions</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Eastern Woodlands</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The peoples of the expansive woodlands of Eastern America live in a large number of tribes, with related religious and linguistic traditions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people subsisted through hunting, fishing and limited agriculture, trading with and periodically making war on their neighbors. They were the first Native North American societies to experience the arrival of Europeans and despite regular outbreaks of disease and warfare, a significant cultural exchange took place as Europeans learned to live and travel in their New World. Native Americans quickly accessed new technologies and markets, fueling an explosion in trade that had a profound effect on all involved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Plains</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people of the North American Plains were predominantly nomadic, living in large territories roamed by great herds of buffalo.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Early adopters of the horse, they lived in societies governed by profound military and religious traditions which produced richly decorated clothing and weaponry. The Plains peoples fought ferociously to maintain their independence as the European nations of North America spread westwards in the nineteenth century. Eventually, after decades of resistance, most Plains people were forced to live on reservations, where despite documented official efforts to eliminate them, traditional practices and languages have survived.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Southwest</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The peoples of the Southwestern United States have a long tradition of settled life that is reliant on agriculture.&nbsp;Diverse peoples with varied cultural and linguistic traditions, the people of the Southwest have long produced highly decorated pottery, jewelery and textiles. These objects form part of a cultural and technological exchange with Mexican societies to the south which remain central to a thriving market in contemporary art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Northwest coast</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The societies of the Northwest coast of North America developed in relative isolation between the Coastal Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Living in small communities on islands and in fjords, they utilized the huge cedar forests to construct the elaborate heraldic structures now known collectively as totem poles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The enthusiasm for carving stretched far beyond the poles, to encompass all areas of life on the coast and their ornate canoes could travel across hundreds of miles of ocean in search of fish, whales, trade or war. Control of the sea allowed chieftains to amass considerable wealth which they distributed to followers at elaborate feasts known as potlatches.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masking, a performance art practiced widely on the coast, was an integral part of potlatches, where ancestral tales were performed in long houses before the tribe and their guests. Some, such as this example, were designed to transform mid-dance from one form to another, an essential part of Northwest Coast storytelling.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Arctic</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The shores of the North American continent around and to the north of the Arctic circle are inhabited by people speaking related, though distinct, Eskimo-Aleut languages: these are Aleut, Alutiiq, Yup&#39;ik and Inupiaq in Alaska; Siberian Yup&rsquo;ik, spoken by the Yuit in Alaska and Siberia; Inuktitut spoken by the Canadian Inuit; and Greenlandic spoken by the Greenland Inuit.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>A world of scarcity</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Traditionally, all these people were dependent on the hunting of whales, walrus, seals and caribou, as well as fishing. They shared certain cultural elements, such as the kayak and umiaq (both types of boat), dog sleds, toggling harpoon heads, the ulu (woman&#39;s knife), seal oil lamps, and double-layer skin clothing, as well as certain hunting and fishing techniques, and some religious beliefs and practices.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>However, there were considerable differences as well. Not all of them lived in snow houses, even seasonally, &nbsp;for example. This common stereotype was mainly informed by the accounts of explorers, who, in their search for a Northwest Passage, came into contact with Canadian Inuit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people of the farthest northern reaches of the Americas live in a world of scarcity: finite resources and a hostile environment have created a resourceful and resilient people who retain much of their ancestral tradition and lifestyle.&nbsp;They depend heavily on the animals that live around them, making clothing, complex tools and even structures from the creatures they hunt and fish. With hunting so vital to Arctic livelihood, a variety of specially adapted tools and techniques were developed specifically to catch and utilize prey both on land and by sea.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today, there are about 130,000 Native people living in the North American Arctic. In Canada (Nunavut) and Greenland, they have attained some degree of self-government. In Alaska, much economic and political power is held by Native corporations.</p>\n"

Here objects from the Museum&rsquo;s collection illustrate the ways in which separate Native American cultures have lived through a colonial period of immense social and environmental upheaval over the last three hundred years.<br />\n"

These ancient people were followed by Archaic hunters from 8000-1000 B.C.E. who exploited the new animal and plant resources of a warming climate, following the end of the ice-age, using specialized tools.&nbsp;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span>After the Archaic period came the Woodland peoples, from about 800 B.C.E., who lived in settled communities, hunting, fishing and gathering and cultivating plants. Large earthworks, such as those of the Ohio Hopewell culture (from about 100 B.C.E. to C.E.&nbsp;600), were created for religious, economic and defensive purposes.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>European colonization</h3>\n"

"<p>At the time of European contact in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there would have probably been between two and ten million Native inhabitants.&nbsp;They were incredibly<br />\n"

European colonization and the expansion of the United States brought diseases and warfare that killed most of the native population. Bison, on which many depended for food, clothing, housing and tools, were hunted almost to extinction by commercial hunters. Further hardship came as many were forced to live in reservations.&nbsp;Continuing conflict culminated in the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 when United States troops massacred hundreds of Lakota after they had surrendered.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today, between two and three million people of native descent live in Canada and the United States of America. They are grouped into more than 1000 bands, tribes or nations all possessing their own oral literatures and histories; their survival and continued vibrancy a testament to the enduring strength of their traditions</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Eastern Woodlands</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The peoples of the expansive woodlands of Eastern America live in a large number of tribes, with related religious and linguistic traditions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people subsisted through hunting, fishing and limited agriculture, trading with and periodically making war on their neighbors. They were the first Native North American societies to experience the arrival of Europeans and despite regular outbreaks of disease and warfare, a significant cultural exchange took place as Europeans learned to live and travel in their New World. Native Americans quickly accessed new technologies and markets, fueling an explosion in trade that had a profound effect on all involved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Plains</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people of the North American Plains were predominantly nomadic, living in large territories roamed by great herds of buffalo.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Early adopters of the horse, they lived in societies governed by profound military and religious traditions which produced richly decorated clothing and weaponry. The Plains peoples fought ferociously to maintain their independence as the European nations of North America spread westwards in the nineteenth century. Eventually, after decades of resistance, most Plains people were forced to live on reservations, where despite documented official efforts to eliminate them, traditional practices and languages have survived.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Southwest</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The peoples of the Southwestern United States have a long tradition of settled life that is reliant on agriculture.&nbsp;Diverse peoples with varied cultural and linguistic traditions, the people of the Southwest have long produced highly decorated pottery, jewelery and textiles. These objects form part of a cultural and technological exchange with Mexican societies to the south which remain central to a thriving market in contemporary art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Northwest coast</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The societies of the Northwest coast of North America developed in relative isolation between the Coastal Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Living in small communities on islands and in fjords, they utilized the huge cedar forests to construct the elaborate heraldic structures now known collectively as totem poles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The enthusiasm for carving stretched far beyond the poles, to encompass all areas of life on the coast and their ornate canoes could travel across hundreds of miles of ocean in search of fish, whales, trade or war. Control of the sea allowed chieftains to amass considerable wealth which they distributed to followers at elaborate feasts known as potlatches.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masking, a performance art practiced widely on the coast, was an integral part of potlatches, where ancestral tales were performed in long houses before the tribe and their guests. Some, such as this example, were designed to transform mid-dance from one form to another, an essential part of Northwest Coast storytelling.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Arctic</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The shores of the North American continent around and to the north of the Arctic circle are inhabited by people speaking related, though distinct, Eskimo-Aleut languages: these are Aleut, Alutiiq, Yup&#39;ik and Inupiaq in Alaska; Siberian Yup&rsquo;ik, spoken by the Yuit in Alaska and Siberia; Inuktitut spoken by the Canadian Inuit; and Greenlandic spoken by the Greenland Inuit.</p>\n"

This word, meaning &quot;snowshoe netters,&quot; is often mistakenly translated as &quot;raw meat eaters.&quot; It is today largely rejected, especially by Canadian groups, who prefer using the term &quot;Inuit,&quot; which means &quot;people&quot;&nbsp;in their language.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A world of scarcity</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Traditionally, all these people were dependent on the hunting of whales, walrus, seals and caribou, as well as fishing. They shared certain cultural elements, such as the kayak and umiaq (both types of boat), dog sleds, toggling harpoon heads, the ulu (woman&#39;s knife), seal oil lamps, and double-layer skin clothing, as well as certain hunting and fishing techniques, and some religious beliefs and practices.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2626aed25b1b79adad32fa3d0ca77ed9e5d73fa2.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Sled</em>, early 19th century C.E., Inughuit (Polar Inuit),&nbsp;bone, ivory and wood, &nbsp;143 cm, Greenland&nbsp;&copy; Trustees of the British Museum. The sled is mostly made from whale, walrus (penis and rib) and other bone, and wood, tied with walrus skin. The shoes on the runners are made of strips of narwhal ivory. It was collected by John Ross on the first occasion that this isolated group of Inuit came into contact with Europeans. Although they had virtually no wood, the Inuit did have access to an amalgam of iron and nickel. This came from meteorites.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, there were considerable differences as well. Not all of them lived in snow houses, even seasonally, &nbsp;for example. This common stereotype was mainly informed by the accounts of explorers, who, in their search for a Northwest Passage, came into contact with Canadian Inuit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people of the farthest northern reaches of the Americas live in a world of scarcity: finite resources and a hostile environment have created a resourceful and resilient people who retain much of their ancestral tradition and lifestyle.&nbsp;They depend heavily on the animals that live around them, making clothing, complex tools and even structures from the creatures they hunt and fish. With hunting so vital to Arctic livelihood, a variety of specially adapted tools and techniques were developed specifically to catch and utilize prey both on land and by sea.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today, there are about 130,000 Native people living in the North American Arctic. In Canada (Nunavut) and Greenland, they have attained some degree of self-government. In Alaska, much economic and political power is held by Native corporations.</p>\n"

"<p>One of the most extraordinary masterpieces of the pre-Columbian Americas is a nearly&nbsp;<span>2,000-year-old cloth from the South Coast of Peru, which has been in the collection of&nbsp;</span><span>the Brooklyn Museum of Art since 1938. </span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Despite the textile&#39;s&nbsp;small size (it measures&nbsp;</span><span>about two&nbsp;by five feet), it contains a vast amount of information about the people&nbsp;</span><span>who lived in ancient Peru; and despite its great age and delicacy, its colors are brilliant,&nbsp;</span><span>and tiny details amazingly intact. This is due to the arid environment of southern Peru&nbsp;</span><span>along the Pacific shore, where it is so dry that organic material buried in the sand remains&nbsp;well preserved for hundreds or even thousands of years.&nbsp;</span><br />\n"

"<h3>Clothing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Arctic, where temperatures are below freezing for most of the year, warm clothing is of great importance. It is vital for hunters who spend many hours outside fishing or hunting seals, walrus, whales and caribou. Traditional Inuit skin clothing is well suited to this purpose because it provides excellent insulation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In winter, two layers of clothes were worn when hunting or traveling. The inner layer has the fur turned inwards towards the body, while the fur of the outer layer is turned outwards. Warm air is trapped between the two layers of clothing and the body, providing excellent insulation against the cold.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today traditional skin clothing remains important to Inuit. Not only are certain kinds of traditional clothing still preferred over manufactured garments, but the making and use of clothing plays a significant role in keeping Inuit cultural values and knowledge alive. Clothing both sustains and expresses Inuit identity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Woman&#39;s amauti of sealskin</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Woman's amauti of sealskin, Inuit of Labrador or Nunavik, eastern Canadian Arctic, date unknown, © Trustees of the British Museum\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6bfb83226a89d162881e1bdf9cc61a1fbcbf85a3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Woman&#39;s amauti of sealskin</em>, Inuit of Labrador or Nunavik, 19th century &copy; Trustees of the British Museum</span></span>Unfortunately, there is no documentation on this beautiful woman&#39;s outer parka. However, the design of the costume, particularly the shape of the back flap and the decoration on the garment&#39;s edges, indicate that it was made in Nunavik or Labrador. The back flap is narrow, curving slightly inwards below the waist, and ending in a rounded tip. The decoration with bands of contrasting white and dark stripes of sealskin at the edges of the garment are characteristic of costumes from this part of the eastern Canadian Arctic.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"​Traditional Arctic clothing consists of two layers of caribou skin garments. Caribou skin is used because the hollow hair follicles contain an air bubble; they also trap insulating air. The inner layer has the fur turned inwards towards the skin, while the outer layer has the fur turned outwards. A pocket of insulating air is caught between the body and the two layers of clothing.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Amauti of this style were used by the Inuit of Labrador until their costume changed through the influence of missionaries in the eighteenth century. Thus, it is possible that the amauti dates to the very first years of contact. It may have been worn by one of the Inuit women brought to England by British explorers, who often brought back inhabitants to prove their discoveries. Many of these captured Inuit were painted by European artists, and the paintings - although varying in accuracy of representation - remain valuable documents of Inuit clothing from that time.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Alternatively, the amauti could have been made somewhat later by Inuit of Nunavik. It is very similar to an amauti now in the McCord Museum, Canada that was collected by Dr William Wakeham in 1897, probably on the southern shores of Hudson Strait. This amauti may have been made around the same time in that area.</p>\n"

"<h3>Clothing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Arctic, where temperatures are below freezing for most of the year, warm clothing is of great importance. It is vital for hunters who spend many hours outside fishing or hunting seals, walrus, whales and caribou. Traditional Inuit skin clothing is well suited to this purpose because it provides excellent insulation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In winter, two layers of clothes were worn when hunting or traveling. The inner layer has the fur turned inwards towards the body, while the fur of the outer layer is turned outwards. Warm air is trapped between the two layers of clothing and the body, providing excellent insulation against the cold.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today traditional skin clothing remains important to Inuit. Not only are certain kinds of traditional clothing still preferred over manufactured garments, but the making and use of clothing plays a significant role in keeping Inuit cultural values and knowledge alive. Clothing both sustains and expresses Inuit identity.</p>\n"

"<h3>Woman&#39;s amauti of sealskin</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Woman's amauti of sealskin, Inuit of Labrador or Nunavik, eastern Canadian Arctic, date unknown, © Trustees of the British Museum\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6bfb83226a89d162881e1bdf9cc61a1fbcbf85a3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Woman&#39;s amauti of sealskin</em>, Inuit of Labrador or Nunavik, 19th century &copy; Trustees of the British Museum</span></span>Unfortunately, there is no documentation on this beautiful woman&#39;s outer parka. However, the design of the costume, particularly the shape of the back flap and the decoration on the garment&#39;s edges, indicate that it was made in Nunavik or Labrador. The back flap is narrow, curving slightly inwards below the waist, and ending in a rounded tip. The decoration with bands of contrasting white and dark stripes of sealskin at the edges of the garment are characteristic of costumes from this part of the eastern Canadian Arctic.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"​Traditional Arctic clothing consists of two layers of caribou skin garments. Caribou skin is used because the hollow hair follicles contain an air bubble; they also trap insulating air. The inner layer has the fur turned inwards towards the skin, while the outer layer has the fur turned outwards. A pocket of insulating air is caught between the body and the two layers of clothing.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Amauti of this style were used by the Inuit of Labrador until their costume changed through the influence of missionaries in the eighteenth century. Thus, it is possible that the amauti dates to the very first years of contact. It may have been worn by one of the Inuit women brought to England by British explorers, who often brought back inhabitants to prove their discoveries. Many of these captured Inuit were painted by European artists, and the paintings - although varying in accuracy of representation - remain valuable documents of Inuit clothing from that time.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Alternatively, the amauti could have been made somewhat later by Inuit of Nunavik. It is very similar to an amauti now in the McCord Museum, Canada that was collected by Dr William Wakeham in 1897, probably on the southern shores of Hudson Strait. This amauti may have been made around the same time in that area.</p>\n"

"Every book needs a coat, a protective layer. Without it, after all, the pages would be exposed to the elements and the dirty hands of readers. And so from the very early days of the book the object was given a binding. Medieval bindings mostly consist of two components: boards, commonly made out of wood (but in the later Middle Ages also from compressed paper), and something to cover the boards with. While in medieval times the most common covering material was leather, there is great variation observed in the kind that was used, as well as how it was decorated. Readers and reading communities had their own preferences in this regard. As a result one can &ldquo;read&rdquo; as much from the outside of the book as from its pages: they both transmit important cultural-historical information. This is a essay with an exotic twist, which includes bindings made from seal and human skin.</p>\n"

"<h3>Wearing leather</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most medieval bindings were made out of animal skin&mdash;usually it was a calf or pig who involuntarily ended up protecting the manuscript. Leather proved an ideal material for binding books. It is stiff, which means it does an excellent job protecting the precious cargo inside, while at the same time adding to the desired &ldquo;firmness&rdquo; of the book. The material also repels water quite well. This benefit may seem odd, but it&rsquo;s not. While monks may not have been reading books in the bath tub, they did consult them in the cloister, which was often a damp environment&mdash;given that the hallways were in the open air.</p>\n"

"Every book needs a coat, a protective layer. Without it, after all, the pages would be exposed to the elements and the dirty hands of readers. And so from the very early days of the book the object was given a binding. Medieval bindings mostly consist of two components: boards, commonly made out of wood (but in the later Middle Ages also from compressed paper), and something to cover the boards with. While in medieval times the most common covering material was leather, there is great variation observed in the kind that was used, as well as how it was decorated. Readers and reading communities had their own preferences in this regard. As a result one can &ldquo;read&rdquo; as much from the outside of the book as from its pages: they both transmit important cultural-historical information. This is a essay with an exotic twist, which includes bindings made from seal and human skin.</p>\n"

"<h3>Wearing leather</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most medieval bindings were made out of animal skin&mdash;usually it was a calf or pig who involuntarily ended up protecting the manuscript. Leather proved an ideal material for binding books. It is stiff, which means it does an excellent job protecting the precious cargo inside, while at the same time adding to the desired &ldquo;firmness&rdquo; of the book. The material also repels water quite well. This benefit may seem odd, but it&rsquo;s not. While monks may not have been reading books in the bath tub, they did consult them in the cloister, which was often a damp environment&mdash;given that the hallways were in the open air.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>An added bonus of leather was that it accommodated blind-tooled decoration, which was applied in mesmerizing shapes and patterns. The oldest book to survive with its original binding still in place is the seventh-century St Cuthbert Gospel (which is a Gospel of John, in fact, image above).

"\n"
"<p>But let&rsquo;s start at the beginning. If certain bookmarks can be called &ldquo;smart,&rdquo;&nbsp;it follows that others were, well, dumb. In bookmark terms that qualifier must go to types that are fixed to one specific page rather than being able to freely move throughout the book. The image above&nbsp;shows such a static bookmark, perhaps as old as the twelfth century. It was produced by making a small cut in the corner of the page, after which a strip of parchment was guided through a small incision, and then folded outwards, so as to stick out of the book. The result was as unmovable as it was destructive to the page&mdash;adding to its unflattering qualifier &ldquo;dumb.&rdquo;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>A slightly less invasive version, no doubt preferred by medieval librarians, didn&rsquo;t involve&nbsp;cutting but glueing a tiny strip of parchment on the long side of the page. These so-called &ldquo;fore-edge&rdquo; bookmarks could even be filled with extra information, for example what section started at the marked location (&ldquo;B&rdquo; for &ldquo;Baptism&rdquo; in the image above).</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Broeder Geraert, Vitae of St. Christina the Astonishing and St. Lutgard, 13th century, Amsterdam, University Library, ms. I G 56-57\n"

"\n"
"<p>An unusual example is seen here (left)&mdash;heart-shaped bookmarks that could be clipped onto a page. Interestingly, they were cut out of a thirteenth-century manuscript with a Middle Dutch saint&rsquo;s life. The culprits were nuns in the 20th century, who clearly did not appreciate old books. Only a small number of pages of this very important manuscript have survived undamaged. When you study the book&nbsp;in the University Library of Amsterdam, as I did a few years back, a curious collection of full leaves and heart-shaped fragments ends up on your desk.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The downside of such clip-on bookmarks is that time tended not to be very kind to them. Since they could be separated from the page, many actually were: they fell out or were never re-inserted by the reader. The solution to the vanishing bookmark came in the form of what is called a &ldquo;register bookmark.&quot;&nbsp;This type, which looks like a spider with its legs trapped, was securely fastened to the top of the binding (visible below), so it couldn&rsquo;t get lost. Additionally, the bookmark allowed the reader to mark multiple locations in the book.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Auckland Libraries, Sir George Grey Special Collections, Med. MS S.1588, source: http://medievalbookbindings.com/\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4db69d03bfcea4180208522e9eab11626821b8c4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Auckland Libraries, Sir George Grey Special Collections, Med.

"\n"
"<p>Evidently, these two groups of bookmarks&mdash;static and dynamic&mdash;provided very different approaches to marking information&mdash;and thus to a book&rsquo;s use. Readers who added clip-on or &ldquo;spider&rdquo; bookmarks anticipated they would need to retrieve information not from one single page but from a changing number of pages. In other words, movable bookmarks served an audience with a shifting knowledge &ldquo;appetite,&rdquo;&nbsp;while the static ones encouraged a more &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; use of a book. In other words, both types are telling, in their own way, about medieval reading culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Multi-dynamic bookmarks</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Gilbert, de La Porrée, Commentary on the Pauline Epistles, c. 1160-1200, Harvard, Houghton Library, MS 277, f. 115v\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5a244e9c74e5c1388cbea94ef102bfec57797243.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Gilbert, de La Porr&eacute;e, Commentary on the Pauline Epistles, c. 1160-1200, Harvard, Houghton Library, MS 277, fol. 115v</span></span>And then there is, finally, the multi-dynamic bookmark &ndash; and the story of how a new specimen of this type was discovered. The qualifier &ldquo;multi-dynamic&rdquo;, which is my own, refers to the fact that this bookmark is of the moving type, while at the same time it is able to do much more than simply marking a page. The bookmark&rsquo;s use is as simple as it is clever. This becomes clear when we look at the bookmark in action, for example in this twelfth-century Bible in the Houghton Library.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As you can see, the bookmark consists of two components. As with the spider bookmark, it features a string attached to the top of the binding (in this case the string is a strip from a recycled manuscript page). This allowed the reader to mark a certain page. Nothing new here. The second component, however, is what makes this a smart bookmark: a disk with the numbers 1-4 written on it, fitted in a tiny sleeve. The reader would pull down the marker along the string until the flat top hit the line where he had stopped reading. The disk could subsequently be turned to the appropriate column&mdash;an open medieval book usually showed four columns of text&mdash;meaning the device marked page, column and line.</p>\n"
"\n"

It figures that when in 2005 a tiny specimen of 41 &times; 22 mm (the size of two thumbnails) was sold off at Sotheby&rsquo;s, it went for a stunning $ 11,000.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Just to illustrate that new specimen still emerge, I recently discovered one in the University Library in Leiden, where it was filed in an early-twentieth-century filing cabinet of the Bibliotheca Manuscript Neerlandica&mdash;since moved to a fragment collection with shelfmark BPL 3327).</p>\n"

"<p>The Leiden artifact (above) shows all the characteristics of a rotating bookmark: a small parchment disk with four numbers and a tiny hole in the middle. Interestingly, it is only the second specimen identified in Dutch collections, although the one in Leiden is clearly the oldest of the two (<a href=\"http://www.mmdc.nl/static/site/search/detail.html?searchMode=advanced&amp;recordId=7370&amp;selectedRecordId=7370&amp;maximumRecords=15&amp;recordDisplayLevel=1&amp;startRecord=1&amp;showMap=1&amp;freetextsearch=bookmark&amp;shelfmark=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;author=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;title=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;startyear=Type+in+query&amp;endyear=Type+in+query&amp;alt-title=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;incipit=Type+in+query&amp;annotation_contents=Type+in+query&amp;contains=null&amp;language=null&amp;language_original=null&amp;translator=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;type=null&amp;keyword=Type+in+query&amp;person=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;medium=null&amp;script=Type+in+query&amp;scribe=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;binding=null&amp;binder=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;region=null&amp;place=Type+in+query&amp;patron=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;collection=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29#r7370\">here is the other</a>). While it is hard to date the red roman numbers with precision, it appears they were put on the parchment in the fourteenth century. The striking difference with the Houghton Library specimen above is that the new find comes without its sleeve, which does not survive. It is astonishing still that the tiny disk made it to our day and age. It must have been hidden in the darkness of a manuscript for several hundreds of years until it got separated and became an orphan&mdash; sleeveless and without a home.</p>\n"

"<p>But let&rsquo;s start at the beginning. If certain bookmarks can be called &ldquo;smart,&rdquo;&nbsp;it follows that others were, well, dumb. In bookmark terms that qualifier must go to types that are fixed to one specific page rather than being able to freely move throughout the book. The image above&nbsp;shows such a static bookmark, perhaps as old as the twelfth century. It was produced by making a small cut in the corner of the page, after which a strip of parchment was guided through a small incision, and then folded outwards, so as to stick out of the book. The result was as unmovable as it was destructive to the page&mdash;adding to its unflattering qualifier &ldquo;dumb.&rdquo;</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Glued-on parchment strip with letter B (Utrecht, UB, MS 146, fol. 17r)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a4e340b1e8dd5a0ba2ec0116ef26592eddf7a79a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Glued-on parchment strip with letter B,&nbsp;Summa de casibus conscientiae / Bartholomeus of San Concordio. c. 1460-1480,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mmdc.nl/static/site/search/detail.html?searchMode=advanced&amp;recordId=7913&amp;selectedRecordId=7913&amp;maximumRecords=15&amp;recordDisplayLevel=1&amp;startRecord=31&amp;showMap=1&amp;freetextsearch=bookmark&amp;shelfmark=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;author=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;title=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;startyear=Type+in+query&amp;endyear=Type+in+query&amp;alt-title=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;incipit=Type+in+query&amp;annotation_contents=Type+in+query&amp;contains=null&amp;language=null&amp;language_original=null&amp;translator=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;type=null&amp;keyword=Type+in+query&amp;person=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;medium=null&amp;script=Type+in+query&amp;scribe=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;binding=null&amp;binder=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;region=null&amp;place=Type+in+query&amp;patron=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;collection=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29#r7913\">Utrecht, University Library, MS 146</a>, fol. 17r)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A slightly less invasive version, no doubt preferred by medieval librarians, didn&rsquo;t involved cutting but glueing a tiny strip of parchment on the long side of the page. These so-called &ldquo;fore-edge&rdquo; bookmarks could even be filled with extra information, for example what section started at the marked location (&ldquo;B&rdquo; for &ldquo;Baptism&rdquo; in the image above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dynamic bookmarks</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Broeder Geraert, Vitae of St. Christina the Astonishing and St. Lutgard, 13th century, Amsterdam, University Library, ms. I G 56-57\n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0c913dcf68b477050bf5a821a2f87d87ae8cb32a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Broeder Geraert, <em>Vitae of St. Christina the Astonishing and St. Lutgard</em>, 13th century, Amsterdam, University Library, MSS&nbsp;I G 56-57</span></span>Far more interesting from a book-historical point of view are the more dynamic bookmarks, which could be used at any page of the manuscript because they were movable.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>An unusual example is seen here (left)&mdash;heart-shaped bookmarks that could be clipped onto a page. Interestingly, they were cut out of a thirteenth-century manuscript with a Middle Dutch saint&rsquo;s life. The culprits were nuns in the 20th century, who clearly did not appreciate old books. Only a small number of pages of this very important manuscript have survived undamaged. When you study the book&nbsp;in the University Library of Amsterdam, as I did a few years back, a curious collection of full leaves and heart-shaped fragments ends up on your desk.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The downside of such clip-on bookmarks is that time tended not to be very kind to them. Since they could be separated from the page, many actually were: they fell out or were never re-inserted by the reader. The solution to the vanishing bookmark came in the form of what is called a &ldquo;register bookmark.&quot;&nbsp;This type, which looks like a spider with its legs trapped, was securely fastened to the top of the binding (visible below), so it couldn&rsquo;t get lost. Additionally, the bookmark allowed the reader to mark multiple locations in the book.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Auckland Libraries, Sir George Grey Special Collections, Med. MS S.1588, source: http://medievalbookbindings.com/\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4db69d03bfcea4180208522e9eab11626821b8c4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Auckland Libraries, Sir George Grey Special Collections, Med. MS S.1588, <a href=\"http://http://medievalbookbindings.com/\">source</a></span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Evidently, these two groups of bookmarks&mdash;static and dynamic&mdash;provided very different approaches to marking information&mdash;and thus to a book&rsquo;s use. Readers who added clip-on or &ldquo;spider&rdquo; bookmarks anticipated they would need to retrieve information not from one single page but from a changing number of pages. In other words, movable bookmarks served an audience with a shifting knowledge &ldquo;appetite,&rdquo;&nbsp;while the static ones encouraged a more &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; use of a book. In other words, both types are telling, in their own way, about medieval reading culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Multi-dynamic bookmarks</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Gilbert, de La Porrée, Commentary on the Pauline Epistles, c. 1160-1200, Harvard, Houghton Library, MS 277, f. 115v\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5a244e9c74e5c1388cbea94ef102bfec57797243.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Gilbert, de La Porr&eacute;e, Commentary on the Pauline Epistles, c. 1160-1200, Harvard, Houghton Library, MS 277, fol. 115v</span></span>And then there is, finally, the multi-dynamic bookmark &ndash; and the story of how a new specimen of this type was discovered. The qualifier &ldquo;multi-dynamic&rdquo;, which is my own, refers to the fact that this bookmark is of the moving type, while at the same time it is able to do much more than simply marking a page. The bookmark&rsquo;s use is as simple as it is clever. This becomes clear when we look at the bookmark in action, for example in this twelfth-century Bible in the Houghton Library.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As you can see, the bookmark consists of two components. As with the spider bookmark, it features a string attached to the top of the binding (in this case the string is a strip from a recycled manuscript page). This allowed the reader to mark a certain page. Nothing new here. The second component, however, is what makes this a smart bookmark: a disk with the numbers 1-4 written on it, fitted in a tiny sleeve. The reader would pull down the marker along the string until the flat top hit the line where he had stopped reading. The disk could subsequently be turned to the appropriate column&mdash;an open medieval book usually showed four columns of text&mdash;meaning the device marked page, column and line.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Discovery</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"A medieval revolving bookmark (sold at Sotheby’s, July 5, 2005, lot 16)\n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3f05c30a844e6c40832b7c649d4e58aee760a5db.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">A medieval revolving bookmark (sold at Sotheby&rsquo;s, July 5, 2005, lot 16)</span></span>Although such rotating bookmarks were used well into the age of print (see an example <a href=\"https://blogs.princeton.edu/notabilia/2014/07/12/15th-century-bookmark-with-column-indicator/\">here</a>), only about thirty-five have survived according to an inventory published in the Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society (2001). It figures that when in 2005 a tiny specimen of 41 &times; 22 mm (the size of two thumbnails) was sold off at Sotheby&rsquo;s, it went for a stunning $ 11,000.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Just to illustrate that new specimen still emerge, I recently discovered one in the University Library in Leiden, where it was filed in an early-twentieth-century filing cabinet of the Bibliotheca Manuscript Neerlandica&mdash;since moved to a fragment collection with shelfmark BPL 3327).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Leiden artifact (above) shows all the characteristics of a rotating bookmark: a small parchment disk with four numbers and a tiny hole in the middle. Interestingly, it is only the second specimen identified in Dutch collections, although the one in Leiden is clearly the oldest of the two (<a href=\"http://www.mmdc.nl/static/site/search/detail.html?searchMode=advanced&amp;recordId=7370&amp;selectedRecordId=7370&amp;maximumRecords=15&amp;recordDisplayLevel=1&amp;startRecord=1&amp;showMap=1&amp;freetextsearch=bookmark&amp;shelfmark=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;author=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;title=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;startyear=Type+in+query&amp;endyear=Type+in+query&amp;alt-title=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;incipit=Type+in+query&amp;annotation_contents=Type+in+query&amp;contains=null&amp;language=null&amp;language_original=null&amp;translator=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;type=null&amp;keyword=Type+in+query&amp;person=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;medium=null&amp;script=Type+in+query&amp;scribe=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;binding=null&amp;binder=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;region=null&amp;place=Type+in+query&amp;patron=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;collection=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29#r7370\">here is the other</a>). While it is hard to date the red roman numbers with precision, it appears they were put on the parchment in the fourteenth century. The striking difference with the Houghton Library specimen above is that the new find comes without its sleeve, which does not survive. It is astonishing still that the tiny disk made it to our day and age. It must have been hidden in the darkness of a manuscript for several hundreds of years until it got separated and became an orphan&mdash; sleeveless and without a home.</p>\n"

"Michelangelo&#39;s drawings offer a unique insight into how the artist worked and thought. They are beautiful artworks in their own right but also provide a crucial link between his work as a sculptor, painter and architect.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Michelangelo was extraordinarily famous during his lifetime, so much so that other artists produced portraits of him and three biographies were written. His artistic achievements set him in a class apart from his contemporaries; after the death of his main rival Raphael in 1520, he was to dominate the Roman art world for more than four decades. His primary focus as an artist was the male body, and his drawings chart his relentless search to find poses that would most eloquently express the emotional and spiritual state of his subjects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most of Michelangelo&#39;s drawings were never intended for public display. In fact, he would have been appalled to see them exhibited as he hated showing them to outsiders. He destroyed a large number before he died, probably to prevent them from falling into other hands; he may also have wished to conceal the amount of preparation behind his major works.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Michelangelo was the second of five sons, born in March 1475 near Arezzo in Italy. His family was middle-class - his father was a minor Florentine civil servant - but the family had fallen on hard times.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Michelangelo&#39;s artistic career began at the age of twelve, despite his family&#39;s disapproval because of the low status of artists at the time. He was apprenticed to the successful Florentine artist Domenico Ghirlandaio. Although later in life he claimed to be entirely self-taught, Ghirlandaio&#39;s influence can be seen in his work.</p>\n"

"<p>Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s influence on Michelangelo can be seen by comparing&nbsp;their works. In the period that Michelangelo was in his studio,&nbsp;Ghirlandaio was working on the frescoes for the Tornabuoni&nbsp;chapel in the Florentine church of Santa Maria Novella. <em>Standing Woman</em> is a study for one of the&nbsp;female figure in that&nbsp;fresco cycle. Ghirlandaio records precisely and rapidly&nbsp;the folds of the dress and decorative detail. The sumptuous dress&nbsp;was most likely modelled here by a boy apprentice, hence the&nbsp;head would be drawn separately. This drawing conveys Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s practical&nbsp;approach to designing a large scale commission.&nbsp;In his time in Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s workshop Michelangelo would have&nbsp;seen hundreds of drawings like <em>Standing Woman</em>. There is no&nbsp;doubt that aspects of his style and working practice can be traced&nbsp;back to this early period. By comparing his early drawings with&nbsp;those of his master we can see similarities in the pose, handling of&nbsp;drapery and hatching. Although still an inexperienced artist,&nbsp;Michelangelo&rsquo;s drawing surpasses Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s. Michelangelo&rsquo;s&nbsp;figure has a more convincing depiction of volume and solidity,&nbsp;achieved by much denser cross hatching, a time consuming&nbsp;method of modeling that was employed sparingly by Ghirlandaio.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In an authorized biography written by Condivi in 1553, Michelangelo denies that he was ever apprenticed to Ghirlandaio. After a long and successful career it seems that Michelangelo was keen to establish himself as a self taught genius, setting himself apart from and perhaps even above the traditions of artists who came before him.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After leaving Ghirlandaio&#39;s studio Michelangelo went to work for Lorenzo the Magnificent, the ruler of Florence and head of the powerful Medici family. Lorenzo spotted his gift as a sculptor and soon Michelangelo was invited to join his household. Here he met two of his most important future patrons: Giovanni de&#39; Medici (the future Pope Leo X) and his cousin Giulio, who became Pope Clement VII.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When Lorenzo died in 1492, Michelangelo went on to serve his heir, Piero, whose control of Florence only lasted two years. To avoid the political turmoil surrounding the Medici&#39;s fall, the artist went to Rome, where he made his name with the celebrated marble sculpture the Piet&agrave;, now in St Peter&#39;s basilica in the Vatican. He returned to Florence in 1501 and the next four years - during which he became a lifelong supporter of Florentine republicanism - was one of the most productive periods of his life.</p>\n"

"Most colleges consider your high school transcript to be the single most important factor in your college application. &nbsp;Though taking (or not taking) any specific class will not&nbsp;determine the outcome of your college applications, there are certain general guidelines for selecting classes during high school to put you on the most straightforward&nbsp;path towards admission at a more&nbsp;selective college. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>First, you should <u><strong>challenge yourself with difficult coursework</strong></u> and then <u><strong>do well in these courses</strong></u>. &nbsp;Look for opportunities to take honors, AP, or IB courses which are recognized as offering a rigorous experience to students. &nbsp;Also consider dual-enrolling at a nearby community college or college during your junior or senior year of high school, earning college credit while taking challenging courses that are not offered in your high school. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to taking challenging courses and doing well, it&rsquo;s <u><strong>important to take the right mix of classes</strong></u>. &nbsp;More selective colleges prefer high school students who take at least five core academic classes most semesters (math, english, history, science, foreign language), in addition to a few classes in the arts. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look at these subjects in more detail to prioritize potential courses:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Math</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Math is a subject that builds on itself over the years, becoming increasingly complex as you increase your skills. &nbsp;Most colleges want students to have at least 3 years of high school math, though more&nbsp;selective colleges prefer 4 years. &nbsp;Prioritize taking several of&nbsp;the following courses:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Algebra 1</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Geometry</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Algebra 2</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Trigonometry</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Pre-calculus &amp;&nbsp;Calculus</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Begin with Algebra 1 and Geometry, often considered the building blocks of higher level math and science classes. &nbsp;Wrap up with Calculus, the highest level of math offered by many high schools and often considered the gold standard of pre-college math preparation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>English /&nbsp;Language Arts</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Given the substantial reading and writing requirements of higher education, virtually all&nbsp;colleges expect you to take 4 years of English. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>History /&nbsp;Social Studies</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>History courses offer insight into the world around you, and they also improve&nbsp;your critical reading and writing abilities. &nbsp;College-bound students often take a minimum of 3 years of history courses, prioritizing&nbsp;the following:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>US History</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>US Government</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>World History</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Geography</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Once these standard history courses&nbsp;are completed, college-bound students often choose to&nbsp;take an additional&nbsp;class&nbsp;in an area of history specific to the expertise of&nbsp;instructors in their particular high school. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Science</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Science teaches you how to analyze information and apply theories to the real world. &nbsp;Most colleges prefer that students take at least 3 years of laboratory science classes, while more selective&nbsp;colleges prefer 4 years. &nbsp;Some specific classes to prioritize:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Physical Science or Geology</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Biology</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Chemistry</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Physics</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Foreign Language</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In an increasingly globalized world, having&nbsp;some basic mastery in a language besides English is highly encouraged as part of your high school studies. &nbsp;Most colleges prefer that you take at least 2 full years of the same foreign language, though many students choose to take 3-4 years. &nbsp;It is not advisable to switch between multiple languages; instead, it&rsquo;s best to choose a language of focus your freshman year and study it deeply throughout high school.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Arts</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Though not considered core academic courses, classes in the arts broaden your high school experience and give you the opportunity to build a skillset outside of typical academics. &nbsp;Many colleges recommend one or two semesters in the arts, though students who have a particular passion for a subject often choose to pursue it throughout their 4 years in high school.</p>\n"

"<p>First, you should <u><strong>challenge yourself with difficult coursework</strong></u> and then <u><strong>do well in these courses</strong></u>. &nbsp;Look for opportunities to take honors, AP, or IB courses which are recognized as offering a rigorous experience to students. &nbsp;Also consider dual-enrolling at a nearby community college or college during your junior or senior year of high school, earning college credit while taking challenging courses that are not offered in your high school. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to taking challenging courses and doing well, it&rsquo;s <u><strong>important to take the right mix of classes</strong></u>. &nbsp;More selective colleges prefer high school students who take at least five core academic classes most semesters (math, english, history, science, foreign language), in addition to a few classes in the arts. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look at these subjects in more detail to prioritize potential courses:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>数学</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Math is a subject that builds on itself over the years, becoming increasingly complex as you increase your skills. &nbsp;Most colleges want students to have at least 3 years of high school math, though more&nbsp;selective colleges prefer 4 years. &nbsp;Prioritize taking several of&nbsp;the following courses:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Algebra 1</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Geometry</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Algebra 2</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>三角法</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Pre-calculus &amp;&nbsp;Calculus</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Begin with Algebra 1 and Geometry, often considered the building blocks of higher level math and science classes. &nbsp;Wrap up with Calculus, the highest level of math offered by many high schools and often considered the gold standard of pre-college math preparation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>English /&nbsp;Language Arts</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Given the substantial reading and writing requirements of higher education, virtually all&nbsp;colleges expect you to take 4 years of English. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>History /&nbsp;Social Studies</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>History courses offer insight into the world around you, and they also improve&nbsp;your critical reading and writing abilities. &nbsp;College-bound students often take a minimum of 3 years of history courses, prioritizing&nbsp;the following:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>US History</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>US Government</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>World History</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Geography</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Once these standard history courses&nbsp;are completed, college-bound students often choose to&nbsp;take an additional&nbsp;class&nbsp;in an area of history specific to the expertise of&nbsp;instructors in their particular high school. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Science</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Science teaches you how to analyze information and apply theories to the real world. &nbsp;Most colleges prefer that students take at least 3 years of laboratory science classes, while more selective&nbsp;colleges prefer 4 years. &nbsp;Some specific classes to prioritize:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Physical Science or Geology</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Biology</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Chemistry</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Physics</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Foreign Language</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In an increasingly globalized world, having&nbsp;some basic mastery in a language besides English is highly encouraged as part of your high school studies. &nbsp;Most colleges prefer that you take at least 2 full years of the same foreign language, though many students choose to take 3-4 years. &nbsp;It is not advisable to switch between multiple languages; instead, it&rsquo;s best to choose a language of focus your freshman year and study it deeply throughout high school.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Arts</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Though not considered core academic courses, classes in the arts broaden your high school experience and give you the opportunity to build a skillset outside of typical academics. &nbsp;Many colleges recommend one or two semesters in the arts, though students who have a particular passion for a subject often choose to pursue it throughout their 4 years in high school.</p>\n"

"<p>History has no natural divisions. A woman living in Florence in the 15th century did not think of herself as a woman of the Renaissance. Historians divide history into large and small units in order to make characteristics and changes clear to themselves and to students. It&rsquo;s important to remember that any historical period is a construction and a simplification. Below are some important basics to get you started.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As you read the timeline below, please keep in mind that equally momentous developments have occurred in Africa, Asia, the Americas and in the Pacific.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Prehistoric (before c.&nbsp;3000 B.C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf), c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E., Limestone, 4 1/4&quot; high (Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e55a245465c17f7e2a1e9c4da8b6531d9feaf13f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf)</em>, c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E., Limestone, 4 1/4&quot; high (Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna),&nbsp;photo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/profzucker/7279700294\">Steven Zucker</a>&nbsp;<br />\n"
"(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>The term &ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo; refers to the time before written history. In the West, writing was invented in ancient Mesopotamia just before 3000 B.C.E., so this period includes visual culture (paintings, sculpture, and architecture) made before that date. The oldest decorative forms we can recognize as art come from Africa and may date back to 100,000 B.C.E. In contrast, the oldest cave paintings known are about 40,800 years old, and although we used to think that only our species, Homo Sapiens, made art&mdash;anthropologists now speculate that Neanderthals may have made at least some of these very early images.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Neolithic revolution, one of the most profound developments in all of human history, occurs during the Prehistoric Era. This is when our ancestors learned to farm and domesticate animals, allowing them to give up their nomadic ways, and settle down to build cities and civilizations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ancient (c. 3000 B.C.E. to c. 400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This period includes the great early civilizations of the ancient Near East (think Babylonia), ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, the Etruscans, and the Romans&mdash;everything that comes after the invention of writing and before the fall of the Roman Empire. Keep in mind the disintegration of the Roman Empire took centuries, but to simplify, c. 400 will do.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Artemision Zeus or Poseidon, c. 460 B.C.E., bronze, 2.09 m high, Early Classical (Severe Style), recovered from a shipwreck off Cape Artemision, Greece in 1928 (National Archaeological Museum, Athens), photo: Steven Zucker (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/33ce6801addfb004da4cac57ab2cd49d441bd126.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ancient Greek sculpture of &nbsp;Zeus or Poseidon, c. 460 B.C.E., bronze, 2.09 m high, Early Classical (Severe Style), recovered from a shipwreck off Cape Artemision, Greece in 1928 (National Archaeological Museum, Athens), photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/profzucker/13140681474/in/photostream/\">Steven Zucker</a> (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>It was during this period that the ancient Greeks first applied human reason to their observations of the natural world and created some of the earliest naturalistic images of human beings. This period is often credited with the birth of Western philosophy, mathematics, theater, science, and democracy. The Romans in turn created an empire that extended across most of Europe, and all the lands that surround the Mediterranean Sea. They were expert administrators and engineers and they saw themselves as the inheritors of the great civilizations that came before them, particularly, Greece and Egypt (which they conquered).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that although history is often presented as a series of discrete stories, in reality narratives often overlap making history both more complex and more interesting. For example, it was also during the Roman Empire that the figure we now call Jesus lived. Jesus and his apostles were Jewish men living in what is today Israel, but which was then part of the Roman Empire.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Middle Ages (c. 400 C.E. to c. 1400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first half of this thousand-year period witnessed terrible political and economic upheaval in Western Europe, as waves of invasions by migrating peoples destabilized the Roman Empire. The Roman emperor Constantine established Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) as a new capital in the East in 330 C.E. and the Western Roman Empire broke apart soon after. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the Byzantine Empire (with Constantinople as its capital), flourished.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Christianity spread across what had been the Roman Empire&mdash;even among migrating invaders (Vandals, Visigoths, etc.).&nbsp;The Christian Church, headed by the Pope, emerged as the most powerful institution in Western Europe, the Orthodox Church dominated in the East.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Byzantine Empire in 650\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e0aa046c21732e2ef63a8e5a991d66addca404dc.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Byzantine Empire in 650</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It was during this period that Islam, one of the three great monotheistic religions, was born. Within little more than a century of the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 C.E., Islam had become an empire that stretched from Spain across North Africa, the Middle and Near East, to India. Medieval Islam was a leader in science and technology and established some of the world&rsquo;s great centers of learning (i.e. Cordoba). Islamic culture played an important role in preserving and translating ancient Greek texts at a time when much of the knowledge created during the ancient world was lost.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Petrarch (a writer who lived in the 1300s) described the early Medieval period as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; because to him it seemed to be a period of declining human achievement, especially when he compared it to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. The &ldquo;Middle Ages&rdquo; got its name because Renaissance scholars saw it as a long barbaric period that separated them from the great civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome that they both celebrated and emulated.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Limbourg Brothers, Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry Folio 5, verso: May, 1412-16, manuscript illumination on vellum, 22.5 x 13.6 cm (Musée Condé)\n"

"\n"
"<p>Medieval society was organized into clearly defined strata. At the top was the king. Below were lesser nobles. These lords in turn, ruled over peasants and serfs (the vast majority of the population). Serfs were laborers who were permanently bound to work the land owned by their lord. The basic unit of this system, known as Feudalism, was the lord/vassal relationship. The vassal would provide labor (in the fields or in battle) to the lord in exchange for land and protection. Mobility between strata was very rare.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of course, the thousand years of the Middle Ages saw the creation of many great works of art and literature, but they were different from what Petrarch valued. The works of art created in the Middle Ages were largely focused on the teachings of the Church.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is important to remember that during the Middle Ages it was rare that anyone except members of the clergy (monks, priests, etc.) could read and write. Despite expectations that the world would end in the year 1,000, Western Europe became increasingly stable, and this period is sometimes referred to as the Late (or High) Middle Ages. This period saw the renewal of large scale building and the re-establishment of sizable towns. Monasteries, such as Cluny, became wealthy and important centers of learning.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Within the Middle Ages, there are subdivisions in art history, including Early Christian, Byzantine, Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque and Gothic. When we look closely at much of the art and politics of the 1,000 years of the Middle Ages, we find a complex and ongoing relationship with the memory and legacy of the ancient Roman empire and this is the foundation for the Renaissance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Renaissance (c. 1400 to 1600)</h3>\n"
"\n"

By challenging the power of the Church, and asserting the authority of individual conscience (it was increasingly possible for people to read the bible in the language that they spoke), the Reformation laid the foundation for the value that modern culture places on the individual.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is also during this period that the Scientific Revolution began and observation replaced religious doctrine as the source of our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Copernicus up-ended the ancient Greek model of the heavens by suggesting that the sun was at the center of the solar system and that the planets orbited in circles around it. However, there were still problems with getting this theory to match observation. At the beginning of the 17th century, Kepler theorized (correctly!) that the planets moved in elliptical orbits (not circular ones) and that the speed of the orbits varied according to the planets&rsquo; distance from the sun. So much for the ideal geometries of the Greeks!</p>\n"

"<h3>Early Modern (c. 1600 - 1800)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It might seem strange to date the beginning of the &quot;modern era&quot; to so long ago, but in many ways it was the scientific, political and economic revolutions of the 17th and&nbsp;18th&nbsp;centuries that have most shaped our own society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians study the Baroque style of the 17th century. This was a time of extended and often violent conflict between Catholics and Protestants made all the more complex because of the growing power of&nbsp;Europe&rsquo;s great monarchies. It was a time when nations grew in size, wealth and autonomy and when national boundaries were hardened, prefiguring the countries we know today (France, Spain and England for example). This was also a period of colonization, when European powers divided and exploited the world&rsquo;s natural resources and people for their own benefit&nbsp;(think especially of the African slave trade, or the subjugation and forced conversion of the indigenous&nbsp;peoples of the Americas).<br />\n"

In art history we study the Rococo and Neoclassical styles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The American and French Revolutions date to this period. The emerging middle classes (and later the working-classes) began a centuries-long campaign to gain political power, challenging the control of the aristocracy and monarchy. Successive reform movements (in this period and the 19th century) and revolutions gradually extended the franchise (the right to vote). Previously suffrage had been limited to males who owned land or who paid a certain amount in taxes. It was only in the second half of the 19th and the 20th centuries that universal suffrage became the norm in Europe and North America.</p>\n"

"<h3>Modern (after c. 1800)</h3>\n"

"<p>Capitalism became the dominant economic system during this period (though it had its roots in the Renaissance). Individuals risked capital to produce goods in a currency-based market which depended on inexpensive, waged labor.

At the same time, the 20th Century was marked by the struggle for human rights and the rise of global capitalism.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where artists had previously worked under the instructions of wealthy patrons associated with the church or state, in this period, art became part of the market economy, and art itself came to be seen as personal self-expression. The high value placed on the individual, which emerged in ancient Greece and Rome and then again in the Renaissance, became the primary value of Western culture. Where artistic styles (for example, Baroque) had once covered numerous artists working over broad regions and periods of time, in the late Nineteenth and through the 20th Century, successive styles of art change with increasing speed and fracture into a kaleidoscope of individual artistic practices.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>We are immersed in our own time and it can be difficult to see the world around us objectively. One of the modern definitions of an artist, in fact, is someone who is particularly insightful about their own cultural moment. Thanks to global capitalism, social media and the internet, we are more interconnected and interdependent than at any other time in history. Some see this as a utopian moment. With internet access, we can all contribute to and benefit from what is being called the Information Revolution. For others, the prevalence of technology in our lives threatens our individuality and privacy, and reduces us to a data point that can be monetized by corporations like Facebook, Google, and Apple. One thing is certain, throughout the time periods sketched above, art has meant different things, and it is likely to be differently defined in the future.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The history of humanity is recorded in our visual culture. Like the fate of previous civilizations, time will eventually destroy much of the visual culture that we are familiar with today. Future art historians will seek to reconstruct the world we now live in, to better understand the nuanced meanings that are so familiar to us.

"<p>History has no natural divisions. A woman living in Florence in the 15th century did not think of herself as a woman of the Renaissance. Historians divide history into large and small units in order to make characteristics and changes clear to themselves and to students. It&rsquo;s important to remember that any historical period is a construction and a simplification. Below are some important basics to get you started.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As you read the timeline below, please keep in mind that equally momentous developments have occurred in Africa, Asia, the Americas and in the Pacific.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Prehistoric (before c.&nbsp;3000 B.C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf), c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E., Limestone, 4 1/4&quot; high (Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e55a245465c17f7e2a1e9c4da8b6531d9feaf13f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf)</em>, c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E., Limestone, 4 1/4&quot; high (Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna),&nbsp;photo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/profzucker/7279700294\">Steven Zucker</a>&nbsp;<br />\n"
"(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>The term &ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo; refers to the time before written history. In the West, writing was invented in ancient Mesopotamia just before 3000 B.C.E., so this period includes visual culture (paintings, sculpture, and architecture) made before that date. The oldest decorative forms we can recognize as art come from Africa and may date back to 100,000 B.C.E. In contrast, the oldest cave paintings known are about 40,800 years old, and although we used to think that only our species, Homo Sapiens, made art&mdash;anthropologists now speculate that Neanderthals may have made at least some of these very early images.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Neolithic revolution, one of the most profound developments in all of human history, occurs during the Prehistoric Era. This is when our ancestors learned to farm and domesticate animals, allowing them to give up their nomadic ways, and settle down to build cities and civilizations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ancient (c. 3000 B.C.E. to c. 400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This period includes the great early civilizations of the ancient Near East (think Babylonia), ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, the Etruscans, and the Romans&mdash;everything that comes after the invention of writing and before the fall of the Roman Empire. Keep in mind the disintegration of the Roman Empire took centuries, but to simplify, c. 400 will do.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/33ce6801addfb004da4cac57ab2cd49d441bd126.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ancient Greek sculpture of &nbsp;Zeus or Poseidon, c. 460 B.C.E., bronze, 2.09 m high, Early Classical (Severe Style), recovered from a shipwreck off Cape Artemision, Greece in 1928 (National Archaeological Museum, Athens), photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/profzucker/13140681474/in/photostream/\">Steven Zucker</a> (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>It was during this period that the ancient Greeks first applied human reason to their observations of the natural world and created some of the earliest naturalistic images of human beings. This period is often credited with the birth of Western philosophy, mathematics, theater, science, and democracy. The Romans in turn created an empire that extended across most of Europe, and all the lands that surround the Mediterranean Sea. They were expert administrators and engineers and they saw themselves as the inheritors of the great civilizations that came before them, particularly, Greece and Egypt (which they conquered).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that although history is often presented as a series of discrete stories, in reality narratives often overlap making history both more complex and more interesting. For example, it was also during the Roman Empire that the figure we now call Jesus lived. Jesus and his apostles were Jewish men living in what is today Israel, but which was then part of the Roman Empire.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Middle Ages (c. 400 C.E. to c. 1400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first half of this thousand-year period witnessed terrible political and economic upheaval in Western Europe, as waves of invasions by migrating peoples destabilized the Roman Empire. The Roman emperor Constantine established Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) as a new capital in the East in 330 C.E. and the Western Roman Empire broke apart soon after. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the Byzantine Empire (with Constantinople as its capital), flourished.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Christianity spread across what had been the Roman Empire&mdash;even among migrating invaders (Vandals, Visigoths, etc.).&nbsp;The Christian Church, headed by the Pope, emerged as the most powerful institution in Western Europe, the Orthodox Church dominated in the East.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It was during this period that Islam, one of the three great monotheistic religions, was born. Within little more than a century of the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 C.E., Islam had become an empire that stretched from Spain across North Africa, the Middle and Near East, to India. Medieval Islam was a leader in science and technology and established some of the world&rsquo;s great centers of learning (i.e. Cordoba). Islamic culture played an important role in preserving and translating ancient Greek texts at a time when much of the knowledge created during the ancient world was lost.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Petrarch (a writer who lived in the 1300s) described the early Medieval period as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; because to him it seemed to be a period of declining human achievement, especially when he compared it to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. The &ldquo;Middle Ages&rdquo; got its name because Renaissance scholars saw it as a long barbaric period that separated them from the great civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome that they both celebrated and emulated.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Medieval society was organized into clearly defined strata. At the top was the king. Below were lesser nobles. These lords in turn, ruled over peasants and serfs (the vast majority of the population). Serfs were laborers who were permanently bound to work the land owned by their lord. The basic unit of this system, known as Feudalism, was the lord/vassal relationship. The vassal would provide labor (in the fields or in battle) to the lord in exchange for land and protection. Mobility between strata was very rare.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of course, the thousand years of the Middle Ages saw the creation of many great works of art and literature, but they were different from what Petrarch valued. The works of art created in the Middle Ages were largely focused on the teachings of the Church.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is important to remember that during the Middle Ages it was rare that anyone except members of the clergy (monks, priests, etc.) could read and write. Despite expectations that the world would end in the year 1,000, Western Europe became increasingly stable, and this period is sometimes referred to as the Late (or High) Middle Ages. This period saw the renewal of large scale building and the re-establishment of sizable towns. Monasteries, such as Cluny, became wealthy and important centers of learning.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Within the Middle Ages, there are subdivisions in art history, including Early Christian, Byzantine, Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque and Gothic. When we look closely at much of the art and politics of the 1,000 years of the Middle Ages, we find a complex and ongoing relationship with the memory and legacy of the ancient Roman empire and this is the foundation for the Renaissance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Renaissance (c. 1400 to 1600)</h3>\n"

"<h3>High civilization</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This sculpture is an exquisite example of art from ancient Mesoamerica, an area of high civilization that includes the territory of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of El Salvador and Honduras. Long before the coming of the Spanish in the sixteenth century, this area independently developed cities and created monumental architecture and sculpture in the city center. Cities were thriving before 1000 B.C.E., or 2,000 years before this sculpture was carved. Important ancient Mesoamerican beings&mdash;noble men and women as well as deities&mdash;were often immortalized in stone and placed in important public places.&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know if the young man seen on the front of this stela represented a young ruler or a god, but we can say that this was an important figure that would have been placed in the center an ancient city, as a focal point for religious ritual.</p>\n"

"<h3>High civilization</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This sculpture is an exquisite example of art from ancient Mesoamerica, an area of high civilization that includes the territory of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of El Salvador and Honduras. Long before the coming of the Spanish in the sixteenth century, this area independently developed cities and created monumental architecture and sculpture in the city center. Cities were thriving before 1000 B.C.E., or 2,000 years before this sculpture was carved. Important ancient Mesoamerican beings&mdash;noble men and women as well as deities&mdash;were often immortalized in stone and placed in important public places.&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know if the young man seen on the front of this stela represented a young ruler or a god, but we can say that this was an important figure that would have been placed in the center an ancient city, as a focal point for religious ritual.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>Sir Francis Bacon</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In 1620, around the time that people first began to look through microscopes, an English politician named Sir Francis Bacon developed a method for philosophers to use in weighing the truthfulness of knowledge. While Bacon agreed with medieval thinkers that humans too often erred in interpreting what their five senses perceived, he also realized that people&#39;s sensory experiences provided the best possible means of making sense of the world. Because humans could incorrectly interpret anything they saw, heard, smelled, tasted, or felt, Bacon insisted that they must doubt everything before assuming its truth.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Testing hypotheses</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In order to test potential truths, or hypotheses, Bacon devised a method whereby scientists set up experiments to manipulate nature, and attempt to prove their hypotheses wrong. For example, in order to test the idea that sickness came from external causes, Bacon argued that scientists should expose healthy people to outside influences such as coldness, wetness, or other sick people to discover if any of these external variables resulted in more people getting sick. Knowing that many different causes for sickness might be missed by humans who are unable or unwilling to perceive them, Bacon insisted that experiments must be consistently repeated before truth can be known: a scientist must show that patients exposed to a specific variable more frequently got sick again, and again, and again.</p>\n"

Bacon&#39;s philosophical work marks a very significant breakthrough for the study of the world around us, but it is important to stress that this method of investigation was not completed in a vacuum. Rather, Bacon&#39;s work should be seen as a part of a widespread cultural revolution accelerated by the rise of the printing press in the fifteenth century.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Importance of the printing press</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Advances in the ability to disseminate new ideas by making standardized letters, numbers, and diagrams repeatable allowed for an unprecedented level of cooperation among philosophers who could now build on each other&#39;s ideas over long periods of time. It would be difficult to overstate the effect of the print revolution. Astronomers such as Copernicus and Galileo began to share and build upon their experiments, and religious reformers began to publicize new (and increasingly radical) Protestant ideas. In a mutually beneficial relationship the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution encouraged philosophers to discover all they could about nature as a way to learn more about God, an undertaking that promoted a break with past authorities.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A direct engagement with nature</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Artisans and craftspeople soon began engaging in the new &quot;natural philosophy,&quot; exemplifying the fact that a monumental shift in what constituted evidence for truth was under way. Not only did renaissance artisans create lenses to see, tools to measure, and artworks to replicate the natural world, but by the sixteenth century, they began to publish philosophical treatises asserting that through the imitation and reproduction of nature in their arts, they were able to achieve a state of direct engagement with nature. Rather than taking knowledge from ancient sources, they argued that true knowledge came from direct experience. Alchemists likewise prioritized direct engagement with nature. In using fire to divide elements into their &quot;smallest&quot; components (and discovering that there were more than four of them), alchemists promoted the revolutionary idea that observation of nature itself, rather than reliance on ancient authorities, provided the best foundation for knowledge.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Royal Society</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These new ideas crystallized with the work of Francis Bacon. In his work as a politician he called for the development of an institution that would promote and regulate the acquisition of knowledge derived from observation. After considerable delay, caused by a civil war and the execution of King Charles I, the Royal Society for Improving Natural Knowledge was founded in 1660. A gentleman&#39;s club composed of tinkering aristocrats, the Royal Society promoted Bacon&#39;s principles of exact observation and measurement of experiments in its periodical Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, generally credited as being the first scientific journal.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c39fe57a21598eac1707416ad450b68131110e29.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Frontispiece to Thomas Sprat, The History of the Royal-Society of London, etching by Winceslaus Hollar, after John Evelyn, 1667. &quot;The book was a manifesto of the Society&#39;s aims and methods....primarily aimed at the king in the (unrealised) hope that he would fund their future activities. The frontispiece flatters Charles II by presenting him as a classical bust being wreathed by an allegorical figure of Fame. The Society President, Viscount Brouncker, points to the Latin inscription &#39;Charles II founder and Patron of the Royal Society.&#39; Francis Bacon, gesturing towards an array of scientific instruments, is indentified as the &#39;Renewer of Arts&#39;.&quot; (from the National Portrait Gallery, London.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Once Bacon&#39;s philosophies regarding experimentation and observation came to be accepted, people began using them to harness nature for profit. The study of nature came to be less about changing traditional attitudes and beliefs, and more about stimulating the economy. By the end of the following century, the Scientific Revolution had given birth to an Industrial Revolution which dramatically transformed the daily lives of people around the world. &nbsp;Western society has been moving forward on Bacon&#39;s model for the past three hundred years. Perhaps though, we are in danger of forgetting the vital role doubt played in Bacon&#39;s philosophy. &nbsp;Even with&nbsp;powerful microscopes, there is still a lot that human senses miss.</span></p>\n"

"<h3><span>Sir Francis Bacon</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In 1620, around the time that people first began to look through microscopes, an English politician named Sir Francis Bacon developed a method for philosophers to use in weighing the truthfulness of knowledge. While Bacon agreed with medieval thinkers that humans too often erred in interpreting what their five senses perceived, he also realized that people&#39;s sensory experiences provided the best possible means of making sense of the world. Because humans could incorrectly interpret anything they saw, heard, smelled, tasted, or felt, Bacon insisted that they must doubt everything before assuming its truth.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Testing hypotheses</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In order to test potential truths, or hypotheses, Bacon devised a method whereby scientists set up experiments to manipulate nature, and attempt to prove their hypotheses wrong. For example, in order to test the idea that sickness came from external causes, Bacon argued that scientists should expose healthy people to outside influences such as coldness, wetness, or other sick people to discover if any of these external variables resulted in more people getting sick. Knowing that many different causes for sickness might be missed by humans who are unable or unwilling to perceive them, Bacon insisted that experiments must be consistently repeated before truth can be known: a scientist must show that patients exposed to a specific variable more frequently got sick again, and again, and again.</p>\n"

Galileo is shown kneeling before personifications of mathematics (holding a compass), astronomy (with the crown of stars) and optics.</span></span><span>Although modern scientists have revised many of the truths subsequently adopted by Bacon and his contemporaries, we still utilize the method of proving knowledge to be true via doubt and experimentation that Bacon laid out in 1620. Bacon&#39;s philosophical work marks a very significant breakthrough for the study of the world around us, but it is important to stress that this method of investigation was not completed in a vacuum. Rather, Bacon&#39;s work should be seen as a part of a widespread cultural revolution accelerated by the rise of the printing press in the fifteenth century.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Importance of the printing press</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Advances in the ability to disseminate new ideas by making standardized letters, numbers, and diagrams repeatable allowed for an unprecedented level of cooperation among philosophers who could now build on each other&#39;s ideas over long periods of time. It would be difficult to overstate the effect of the print revolution. Astronomers such as Copernicus and Galileo began to share and build upon their experiments, and religious reformers began to publicize new (and increasingly radical) Protestant ideas. In a mutually beneficial relationship the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution encouraged philosophers to discover all they could about nature as a way to learn more about God, an undertaking that promoted a break with past authorities.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A direct engagement with nature</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Artisans and craftspeople soon began engaging in the new &quot;natural philosophy,&quot; exemplifying the fact that a monumental shift in what constituted evidence for truth was under way. Not only did renaissance artisans create lenses to see, tools to measure, and artworks to replicate the natural world, but by the sixteenth century, they began to publish philosophical treatises asserting that through the imitation and reproduction of nature in their arts, they were able to achieve a state of direct engagement with nature. Rather than taking knowledge from ancient sources, they argued that true knowledge came from direct experience. Alchemists likewise prioritized direct engagement with nature. In using fire to divide elements into their &quot;smallest&quot; components (and discovering that there were more than four of them), alchemists promoted the revolutionary idea that observation of nature itself, rather than reliance on ancient authorities, provided the best foundation for knowledge.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Royal Society</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These new ideas crystallized with the work of Francis Bacon. In his work as a politician he called for the development of an institution that would promote and regulate the acquisition of knowledge derived from observation. After considerable delay, caused by a civil war and the execution of King Charles I, the Royal Society for Improving Natural Knowledge was founded in 1660. A gentleman&#39;s club composed of tinkering aristocrats, the Royal Society promoted Bacon&#39;s principles of exact observation and measurement of experiments in its periodical Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, generally credited as being the first scientific journal.</p>\n"

The frontispiece flatters Charles II by presenting him as a classical bust being wreathed by an allegorical figure of Fame. The Society President, Viscount Brouncker, points to the Latin inscription &#39;Charles II founder and Patron of the Royal Society.&#39; Francis Bacon, gesturing towards an array of scientific instruments, is indentified as the &#39;Renewer of Arts&#39;.&quot; (from the National Portrait Gallery, London.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Once Bacon&#39;s philosophies regarding experimentation and observation came to be accepted, people began using them to harness nature for profit. The study of nature came to be less about changing traditional attitudes and beliefs, and more about stimulating the economy. By the end of the following century, the Scientific Revolution had given birth to an Industrial Revolution which dramatically transformed the daily lives of people around the world. &nbsp;Western society has been moving forward on Bacon&#39;s model for the past three hundred years. Perhaps though, we are in danger of forgetting the vital role doubt played in Bacon&#39;s philosophy. &nbsp;Even with&nbsp;powerful microscopes, there is still a lot that human senses miss.</span></p>\n"

Purchased in large cycles or as single images, they were intended to amuse and instruct, with subjects like zodiac signs, religious imagery, portraits, and heraldry.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>It&#39;s quite small, but this silver-stained roundel of the Archangel Michael conquering Satan (below) conveys an amazing sense of depth.

At the top,&nbsp;beautiful young maidens and dashing young men are&nbsp;falcon hunting in the forest,&nbsp;a pastime that was thought to lead to amorous dalliances..</span></p>\n"

"<p>During the Renaissance, light-filled rooms in homes were popular, and that is&nbsp;where secular panels like this were often installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;You were meant to look through them, from your&nbsp;house&nbsp;or&nbsp;castle, out onto the outer world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the late 1400s glass became more affordable, and houses were increasingly fitted with clear glass windows, sometimes inset with small stained-glass panels. This&nbsp;panel shows&nbsp;a family coat of arms and&nbsp;was probably made for a private home. Typical of such panels, it is colorful, light, and humorous.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Large-scale stained&nbsp;glass</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The production of large-scale stained-glass windows for churches flourished in Europe during the Renaissance. These two monumental examples (left) probably once decorated a chapel. On the left is a Crucifixion scene with the Virgin and St. John the Evangelist, and on the right is a young kneeling donor. As he adores The Crucifixion, the donor is protected by Saint Christopher, the giant who ferried the Christ child over a river. The brilliant color and complex workmanship of these panels indicate that they were a lavish expression of piety on the part of the young, unidentified donor.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>These panels contain just about all you need to know to understand the fundamentals of stained glass. They are made partly of&nbsp;</span>colored glass, which you see from the rich robes of St. John the Evangelist and the Virgin.&nbsp;<span>This red glass and blue glass would be a consistent color throughout. But then you also have various ways in which the glass&nbsp;painter manipulated the layers of glass. You see the constant use of silver stain, or yellow stain. </span><br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>A single piece of glass</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>​During the late 1400s glass windows in domestic interiors became ubiquitous, and small painted roundels like this one&mdash;a single piece of clear glass with vitreous paint and golden silver stain&mdash;became so popular that their production reached nearly industrial proportions by the 1520s. Purchased in large cycles or as single images, they were intended to amuse and instruct, with subjects like zodiac signs, religious imagery, portraits, and heraldry.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>It&#39;s quite small, but this silver-stained roundel of the Archangel Michael conquering Satan (below) conveys an amazing sense of depth. It&#39;s a single piece of glass with a picture painted on its surface and golden colors stained on the back. In a way, the light passing through it symbolizes St. Michael&#39;s identity as the angel of light and goodness.</span><br />\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>In this intricate example, the light brown paint has been stippled and scratched away with brushes and pointed sticks to achieve the delicate modeling in Saint Michael&#39;s drapery and the body of Satan.

"\n"
"<h3><span>Money. Possessions. Power.</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The same materialistic ideals which drive many men and women today have performed the same function throughout history. Those in positions of power often chose to commemorate their status through images. Some purchase works of art by famous artists to demonstrate their wealth, while others commission portraits of themselves as reminders of their prestige.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A young couple in the middle of the eighteenth century, Robert Andrews and Frances Andrews, opted for the second option to celebrate their marriage and subsequent combination of their families&#39; fortune. To depict their increased status, the Andrews&rsquo; commissioned a relatively unknown painter named Thomas Gainsborough to paint their portraits. Little could they anticipate that within a few decades it would be the artist, and not the subjects, that would make their portrait famous.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Conversation on Canvas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Gainsborough&rsquo;s portrait of the newly-married Robert and Frances Andrews is typical of the genre of &quot;conversation pieces;&quot; informal group portraits which gained popularity in the middle of the eighteenth century in England. Unlike the formal, straightforward portraits which characterized earlier periods and locations, the &quot;conversation piece&quot; usually presented a small group of individuals in an outdoor space, engaged in discussion and unaware of the viewer&rsquo;s presence. Mr. and Mrs. Andrews diverts from that tradition, as its sitters are clearly reacting to Gainsborough&rsquo;s presence, but their relaxed poses and location in the English countryside connects them to the &quot;conversation piece&quot; tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the time Gainsborough executed this painting, he was a 23-year-old emerging artist working in city of Ipswich in the rural English county of Suffolk. As a teenager he served an apprenticeship in London and also received instruction from Hubert-Fran&ccedil;ois Gravelot, a popular Rococo engraver working in England&rsquo;s capital city. In 1749 Gainsborough moved with his wife to Ipswich, 70 miles from London and just 20 miles from his birthplace of Sudbury, in Suffolk County. Robert Andrews and his future wife, then known as Frances Carter, also grew up in Sudbury, in much wealthier families. In his portrait of the pair, Gainsborough captures the barely-veiled disdain in Frances Andrews&rsquo; eyes and her wry smile. She and her husband are well aware that the portraitist, whom they would have known since childhood, is well below them on the social ladder.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>Love of Landscape</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Following the &quot;conversation piece&quot; tradition, Gainsborough includes a landscape in his painting. However, he provides a much greater view of rural England than might be expected from such a work. Mr. and Mrs. Andrews pose on the left half of the canvas, rather than directly in the middle as was typical in a straightforward portrait. On the right side, Gainsborough gives equal attention to the grounds of The Auberies, the Andrews&rsquo; estate in Sudbury.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The couple is located on the edge of a field of wheat, and fenced in cattle populate the middle ground to the left while sheep graze to the right of the pair. Through the implementation of modern agricultural techniques and technology, Mr. Andrews has brought the land under his control. His pose is meant to suggest that his work is done and he can now relax and hunt with his dog, although he doesn&rsquo;t look very comfortable holding his rifle.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The attention Gainsborough lavishes on the rolling English countryside reflects his lifelong love for nature. Although he became famous as a portrait painter, Gainsborough insisted throughout his life that landscape painting was his true calling, and he considered himself a landscape painter rather than a portraitist. He spent most of his career outside of London, the center of the English art world. After leaving Ipswich a decade after painting Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, Gainsborough set up shop in the resort city of Bath, where his delicate and sensual portraits defined the Rococo fashion in England in the second half of the eighteenth century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Rococo in England</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Rococo was a French style, imported by foreign artists like Hubert-Fran&ccedil;ois Gravelot and by English collectors. In the early 1700s England did not have a strong painting tradition, and its most famous artists were international painters who traveled to London to take advantage of that fact. Gainsborough looked to the frivolous, playful paintings being commissioned by French aristocrats, and applied their delicate style to slightly more reserved and contained subjects.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Mrs. Andrews&rsquo; dress possesses the pastel colors and delicate lace of more erotic French works like Jean-Honor&eacute; Fragonard&rsquo;s The Swing. Her dress and Mr. Andrews&rsquo; shirt glimmer in sunlight, despite the overcast sky. Mrs. Andrews sits on a bench that is entirely too elaborate to sit exposed in the middle of a wheat field. Both figures are pale and lithe, reflecting the upper class privilege of not having to work for a living. Their expansive estate functions as an ostentatious demonstration of their wealth: it continues as far as the eye can see.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Although the Andrews purchased their conversation portrait from Gainsborough, something is missing from the work. Bare canvas surrounds Mrs. Andrews&#39; hands, folded in her lap. No one knows exactly what Gainsborough intended to paint in that space, if he intended to paint anything at all. Some scholars have suggested that Mrs. Andrews was meant to hold a dead game bird, the result of a successful hunting trip by her husband. Such an inclusion would emphasize the couple&rsquo;s control over their land, but a bloody animal would ruin Mrs. Andrews&rsquo; elaborate dress, and therefore seems unlikely.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Another possibility for Mrs. Andrews&rsquo; lap is that the blank space was intended for a baby. Regardless of what was meant to go in that spot, Gainsborough never added it in. Modern scholars consider the painting to be &ldquo;unfinished,&rdquo; but we&rsquo;ll never know what the original finished work was to look like, or if its current state was as &ldquo;finished&rdquo; as Gainsborough and the Andrews wanted.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>While there is no one text or creed that forms the basis of all Hindu beliefs, several texts are considered fundamental to all branches of Hinduism. These texts are generally divided into two main groups: eternal, revealed texts, and those based upon what humanity has learned and written down. The Vedas are an example of the former, while the two great epics, the <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em>, belong to the latter category. For centuries, texts were transmitted orally, and the priestly caste, or brahmans, was entrusted with memorization and preservation of sacred texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Vedas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Vedas are India&rsquo;s earliest surviving texts, dating from approximately 2000 to 1500 B.C.E. These texts are made up of hymns and ritual treatises that are instructional in nature, along with other sections that are more speculative and metaphysical. The Vedas are greatly revered by contemporary Hindus as forming the foundation for their deepest beliefs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The early Vedas refer often to certain gods such as Indra, the thunder god, and Agni, who carries messages between humans and the gods through fire sacrifices. Some of these gods persist in later Hinduism, while others are diminished or transformed into other deities over time. The Vedas are considered a timeless revelation, and a source of unchanging knowledge that underlies much of present-day Hindu practices.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These two great epics are the most widely known works in India. Every child becomes familiar with these stories from an early age. The <em>Mahabharata</em> is the world&rsquo;s longest poem, with approximately 100,000 verses. It tells the story of the conflict between the Pandava brothers and their cousins the Kauravas, a rivalry that culminates in a great battle. On the eve of the battle, the Pandava warrior Arjuna is distressed by what will happen. The god Krishna consoles him in a famous passage known as the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> (meaning &ldquo;the Song of the Lord&rdquo;). This section of the <em>Mahabharata</em> has become a standard reference in addressing the duty of the individual, the importance of dharma, and humankind&rsquo;s relationship to God and society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A second epic, the <em>Ramayana</em>, contains some of India&rsquo;s best-loved characters, including Rama and Sita, the ideal royal couple, and their helper, the monkey leader, Hanuman. Rama is an incarnation of the God Vishnu. The story tells of Rama and Sita&rsquo;s withdrawal to the forest after being exiled from the kingdom of Ayodhya. Sita is abducted in the forest by Ravana, the evil king of Lanka. Rama eventually defeats Ravana, with the help of his brother and an army of monkeys and bears. The couple returns to Ayodhya and are crowned, and from that point the story has evolved to acquire different endings. Episodes of the Ramayana are frequently illustrated in Hindu art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Puranas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Puranas are the primary source of stories about the Hindu deities. They were probably assembled between 300 to 1000 C.E., and their presence corresponds to the rise of Hinduism and the growing importance of certain deities. They describe the exploits of the gods as well as various devotional practices associated with them. Some of the Vedic gods&mdash;Indra, Agni, Surya&mdash;reappear in the Puranas, but figure less importantly in the stories than do Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, the various manifestations of the Goddess, and other celestial figures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Tantras</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Around the same time as the recording of the Puranas, a number of texts concerning ritual practices surrounding various deities emerge. They are collectively known as Tantras or Agamas, and refer to religious observances, yoga, behavior, and the proper selection and design of temple sites. Some aspects of the Tantras concern the harnessing of physical energies as a means to achieve spiritual breakthrough. Tantric practices cross religious boundaries, and manifest themselves in aspects of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.</p>\n"

"<p>While there is no one text or creed that forms the basis of all Hindu beliefs, several texts are considered fundamental to all branches of Hinduism. These texts are generally divided into two main groups: eternal, revealed texts, and those based upon what humanity has learned and written down. The Vedas are an example of the former, while the two great epics, the <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em>, belong to the latter category. For centuries, texts were transmitted orally, and the priestly caste, or brahmans, was entrusted with memorization and preservation of sacred texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Vedas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Vedas are India&rsquo;s earliest surviving texts, dating from approximately 2000 to 1500 B.C.E. These texts are made up of hymns and ritual treatises that are instructional in nature, along with other sections that are more speculative and metaphysical. The Vedas are greatly revered by contemporary Hindus as forming the foundation for their deepest beliefs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The early Vedas refer often to certain gods such as Indra, the thunder god, and Agni, who carries messages between humans and the gods through fire sacrifices. Some of these gods persist in later Hinduism, while others are diminished or transformed into other deities over time. The Vedas are considered a timeless revelation, and a source of unchanging knowledge that underlies much of present-day Hindu practices.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These two great epics are the most widely known works in India. Every child becomes familiar with these stories from an early age. The <em>Mahabharata</em> is the world&rsquo;s longest poem, with approximately 100,000 verses. It tells the story of the conflict between the Pandava brothers and their cousins the Kauravas, a rivalry that culminates in a great battle. On the eve of the battle, the Pandava warrior Arjuna is distressed by what will happen. The god Krishna consoles him in a famous passage known as the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> (meaning &ldquo;the Song of the Lord&rdquo;). This section of the <em>Mahabharata</em> has become a standard reference in addressing the duty of the individual, the importance of dharma, and humankind&rsquo;s relationship to God and society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A second epic, the <em>Ramayana</em>, contains some of India&rsquo;s best-loved characters, including Rama and Sita, the ideal royal couple, and their helper, the monkey leader, Hanuman. Rama is an incarnation of the God Vishnu. The story tells of Rama and Sita&rsquo;s withdrawal to the forest after being exiled from the kingdom of Ayodhya. Sita is abducted in the forest by Ravana, the evil king of Lanka. Rama eventually defeats Ravana, with the help of his brother and an army of monkeys and bears. The couple returns to Ayodhya and are crowned, and from that point the story has evolved to acquire different endings. Episodes of the Ramayana are frequently illustrated in Hindu art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Puranas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Puranas are the primary source of stories about the Hindu deities. They were probably assembled between 300 to 1000 C.E., and their presence corresponds to the rise of Hinduism and the growing importance of certain deities. They describe the exploits of the gods as well as various devotional practices associated with them. Some of the Vedic gods&mdash;Indra, Agni, Surya&mdash;reappear in the Puranas, but figure less importantly in the stories than do Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, the various manifestations of the Goddess, and other celestial figures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Tantras</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Around the same time as the recording of the Puranas, a number of texts concerning ritual practices surrounding various deities emerge. They are collectively known as Tantras or Agamas, and refer to religious observances, yoga, behavior, and the proper selection and design of temple sites. Some aspects of the Tantras concern the harnessing of physical energies as a means to achieve spiritual breakthrough. Tantric practices cross religious boundaries, and manifest themselves in aspects of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Brown and the Pre-Raphaelites</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ford Madox Brown is associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of British artists noted for their attention to detail, vibrant colors, and interest in scenes from literature. Although Brown himself was never an official member of the PRB, he was friendly with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others in the group. The two got to know each other when Rossetti appeared on Brown&rsquo;s doorstep in 1848 asking for art lessons. Although the lessons were short-lived, the two developed a lasting friendship. Through his association with the PRB, Brown adopted many of their stylistic tendencies, particularly the use of bright colors and attention to detail.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Modern Life</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, Brown&rsquo;s paintings show a much greater interest in subjects of modern life than many of the other artists associated with the PRB. Brown recalled that he got the idea for <em>Work </em>from seeing navvies, or construction workers, excavating sewers in Hampstead, North London. The painting was begun in the summer of 1852. Brown traveled to the same spot in Hampstead every day, transporting his canvas back and forth by means of a special cart. The background landscape of the painting was completed right on the street in Hampstead so that Brown could capture the precise details of light, color and form. This interest in direct observation and specificity were hallmarks of the Pre-Raphaelite style.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>VIctorian ideas of class</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting centers on a group of working-class navvies. These figures represent the noble &ldquo;working man,&rdquo; as they are neatly dressed and diligently going about their tasks. In contrast to the workers, there is a group of ragged children in the foreground, representing the lowest of the lower classes. In the catalogue of his 1865 one-man exhibition, Brown tells us that the children&rsquo;s mother is dead, and that the oldest, a girl of ten, is in charge of the rest of the children. She wears a tattered dress and is holding an infant over one shoulder.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Also representative of the lowest class is the ragged and barefoot plant seller on the left side, a figure whom Brown described as a &ldquo;ragged wretch who has never been taught to work.&rdquo; This hunched figure represents a stark contrast to the industrious and athletic navvies. shoveling away. Both the workers and the ragged children form another contrast, this time to the upper class figures depicted in the painting. On the left hand side, two ladies skirt the edge of the picture. The first, lady carrying a parasol, is a portrait of the artist&rsquo;s Brown&rsquo;s wife Emma. Following along behind is another well-dressed woman who offers a religious tract to one of the navvies. Seeing to the religious education of the lower classes was a type of &ldquo;work&rdquo; engaged in by many evangelical middle-class women.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"On the right side of the painting, two well-dressed men watch the navvies work.

Maurice was a leading Christian Socialist and founder of the Working Men&rsquo;s College, where Brown was recruited as an instructor along with Rossetti and the art critic John Ruskin. One of the posters visible on the far left side on the canvas is an advertisement for the Working Men&rsquo;s College.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At first glance Brown&rsquo;s painting <em>Work </em>may appear to be an illustration of the stratification of social class in Victorian England. However, a deeper look reveals both a stunning example of the colorful and detailed Pre-Raphaelite style of painting as well as a commentary on the role of &ldquo;work,&rdquo; and its relationship to Victorian class structure. &nbsp;<em>Work </em>is at once a vivid reminder of both the class-consciousness of the Victorian age and the reforming spirit of that time which ultimately led to reforms like the ten-hour work day, and regulations restricting child labor.</p>\n"

Taken from the play <em>Measure for Measure</em>, which tells the story of Claudio, who has been sentenced to death by Lord Angelo (the temporary ruler of Vienna) for impregnating his fianc&eacute;e. Claudio&rsquo;s sister Isabella, a nun, goes to Angelo to plead for clemency for her brother and is shocked that he suggests that she trade sex for her brother&rsquo;s life. Of course, she refuses, and Claudio initially agrees with her decision, but later changes his mind. Hunt depicts the moment when the imprisoned Claudio suggests that Isabella sacrifice her virginity to gain his freedom. It was the type of subject that appealed to Hunt, who liked themes to do with questions of guilt and sinful behavior, such as his well known painting <em>The Awakening Conscience</em> (1853).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Claudio and Isabella</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Claudio&rsquo;s face, which is partly in shadow, looks down and away from his sister. His slouching posture, the rich texture of his dark, yet colorful clothes and pointed medieval-looking shoes are a sharp contrast to the stark white of the nun&rsquo;s habit, her upright posture and unwavering gaze. Sunlight from the prison window lights Isabella&rsquo;s face and permits a glimpse of apple blossoms and a church in the distance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/465527153d1ea3e87a0c242ea6295892d377c8b2.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Shackle (detail), William Holman Hunt, <em>Claudio and Isabella</em>, 1850, oil on mahogany, 75.8 x 42.6&nbsp;cm (London, Tate Britain)</span></span>The interior of the scene was painted at Lollard Prison at Lambeth Palace, and the crumbling masonry around the windows and the rusty metal of the shackle that bind Claudio&rsquo;s leg detail the less than desirable conditions. Hunt also painted the lute hanging in the window while at the prison. The lute with its red string is symbolic of lust, but the fact that it is placed in the sunshine rather than the gloom of the cell lessens the negative impact. The petals of apple blossom scattered on Claudio&rsquo;s cloak on the floor, although not added until 1879, are intended to show that Claudio is willing to compromise his sister to save himself.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Financial difficulties&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>Claudio and Isabella</em> was begun in 1850 after Hunt received a small advance from the painter Augustus Egg. Poor reviews of the Pre-Raphaelite paintings at the Royal Academy of 1850 had created financial difficulties for Hunt. He continued to work on the painting for the next several years, finally exhibiting the picture at the Royal Academy of 1853.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&quot;Death is a fearful thing&quot;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting appeared with a quotation from the play carved into the frame, a devise Hunt was to explore in many of his paintings, as a way of reinforcing his message. The short notation &ldquo;Claudio: Death is a fearful thing. Isabella: And shamed life a hateful,&rdquo; serves not only to point to the exact moment in the play, but also as a reminder of the underlying moral dilemma of the subject.&nbsp;The ability to bring to life these moments of ambiguity was one of Hunt&rsquo;s greatest achievements.</p>\n"

Taken from the play <em>Measure for Measure</em>, which tells the story of Claudio, who has been sentenced to death by Lord Angelo (the temporary ruler of Vienna) for impregnating his fianc&eacute;e. Claudio&rsquo;s sister Isabella, a nun, goes to Angelo to plead for clemency for her brother and is shocked that he suggests that she trade sex for her brother&rsquo;s life. Of course, she refuses, and Claudio initially agrees with her decision, but later changes his mind. Hunt depicts the moment when the imprisoned Claudio suggests that Isabella sacrifice her virginity to gain his freedom. It was the type of subject that appealed to Hunt, who liked themes to do with questions of guilt and sinful behavior, such as his well known painting <em>The Awakening Conscience</em> (1853).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Claudio and Isabella</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Claudio&rsquo;s face, which is partly in shadow, looks down and away from his sister. His slouching posture, the rich texture of his dark, yet colorful clothes and pointed medieval-looking shoes are a sharp contrast to the stark white of the nun&rsquo;s habit, her upright posture and unwavering gaze. Sunlight from the prison window lights Isabella&rsquo;s face and permits a glimpse of apple blossoms and a church in the distance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/465527153d1ea3e87a0c242ea6295892d377c8b2.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Shackle (detail), William Holman Hunt, <em>Claudio and Isabella</em>, 1850, oil on mahogany, 75.8 x 42.6&nbsp;cm (London, Tate Britain)</span></span>The interior of the scene was painted at Lollard Prison at Lambeth Palace, and the crumbling masonry around the windows and the rusty metal of the shackle that bind Claudio&rsquo;s leg detail the less than desirable conditions. Hunt also painted the lute hanging in the window while at the prison. The lute with its red string is symbolic of lust, but the fact that it is placed in the sunshine rather than the gloom of the cell lessens the negative impact. The pedals of apple blossom scattered on Claudio&rsquo;s cloak on the floor, although not added until 1879, are intended to show that Claudio is willing to compromise his sister to save himself.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Financial difficulties&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>Claudio and Isabella</em> was begun in 1850 after Hunt received a small advance from the painter Augustus Egg. Poor reviews of the Pre-Raphaelite paintings at the Royal Academy of 1850 had created financial difficulties for Hunt. He continued to work on the painting for the next several years, finally exhibiting the picture at the Royal Academy of 1853.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&quot;Death is a fearful thing&quot;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting appeared with a quotation from the play carved into the frame, a devise Hunt was to explore in many of his paintings, as a way of reinforcing his message. The short notation &ldquo;Claudio: Death is a fearful thing. Isabella: And shamed life a hateful,&rdquo; serves not only to point to the exact moment in the play, but also as a reminder of the underlying moral dilemma of the subject.&nbsp;The ability to bring to life these moments of ambiguity was one of Hunt&rsquo;s greatest achievements.</p>\n"

"\n"

"\n"

"<p>A single reed, cleanly cut from the banks of the Euphrates or Tigris river, when pressed cut-edge down into a soft clay tablet, will make a wedge shape.

"\n"
"<p>Very few cuneiform signs have only one meaning; most have as many as four. Cuneiform signs could represent a whole word or an idea or a number.

"<h3>Cult of domesticity</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the mid-nineteenth century, many people were troubled by the effects that the Industrial Revolution was having on the environment, society at large, and workers employed in factories, concerns that are echoed in today&rsquo;s environmental movement. &nbsp;The English art critic John Ruskin&nbsp;argued that the inexpensive, factory-made goods flooding the markets had a negative effect on both those who made them and those who consumed them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ruskin and others believed that mechanized factory production deprived workers of the personal satisfaction and creativity involved in designing and making an object entirely with one&rsquo;s own hands. &nbsp;They also believed that people who bought these goods were surrounding themselves with soulless objects that lacked aesthetic value.&nbsp;Thus, their domestic environments were missing the elements of spirituality and refinement that produce healthy, well-rounded citizens. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This was a particular concern in the age of the Victorian &ldquo;cult of domesticity,&rdquo; which emphasized the home as a morally uplifting respite from the negative influences of city life. &nbsp;Ruskin and his followers advocated a return to the medieval guild model in which artisans were responsible for handcrafting their works from beginning to end. This&nbsp;produced&nbsp;a sense of pride in the worker and guaranteed&nbsp;quality products for the consumer. &nbsp;William Morris was strongly influenced by Ruskin&rsquo;s writing and also dedicated to social reform.</p>\n"

"<h3>Craftsmanship and&nbsp;community</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Red House was the home he designed in Bexleyheath, a southeastern suburb of London, England, &nbsp;for his family with the assistance of Philip Webb. Webb and Morris met while working in London for the architect G. E. Street. &nbsp;Webb would go on to be one of the major architects of the Gothic Revival movement in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris wanted the house to be a place that reflected his ideals and celebrated art, craftsmanship, and community. &nbsp;Morris and Webb collaborated to make the house&rsquo;s architecture and interior design merge into a unified whole. This&nbsp;would provide the appropriate atmosphere to foster domestic harmony and instill creative energy in its inhabitants and visitors. &nbsp;It was the first home built according to the principles of fine artistry and utility that became the hallmark of the design firm Morris founded with Webb in 1861, as well as the emerging Arts and Crafts movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris and Webb designed the house in a simplified Tudor Gothic style. The features of this style include&nbsp;historicizing elements such as steep roofs, prominent chimneys, cross gables, and exposed-beam ceilings, all&nbsp;present in Red House. &nbsp;Morris was influenced by Ruskin and other theorists who saw the Gothic as a time of perfection in the craft and building trades, as well as a period of great faith and belief in human dignity. &nbsp;They also viewed the Gothic as a more suitable style for&nbsp;Northern Europe because it&nbsp;originated in France, a northern country, as opposed to the classical forms of ancient Greece and Rome. &nbsp;For Morris and Webb, the adoption of a specifically English form of Gothic architecture seemed natural and appropriate to the site.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>A medieval ideal</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The use of exposed red brick for the exterior both gave the house its name and reveals the innate beauty of the construction materials. Morris and Webb valued the specific beauty of natural materials, which they saw as far superior to and healthier than industrially produced materials. Red House is L-shaped, with the rooms laid out for maximum efficiency and clarity. The L-shaped plan also allows the house to embrace the gardens as a part of the domestic sphere, as well as creates an asymmetry that is typical of traditional Gothic structures that were built over long periods of time. The concept of an integral whole extended to the interior design as well.&nbsp;Webb, Morris, his wife, Jane, and the painter Edward Burne-Jones all worked together to design everything in the home, from the wallpaper to the stained-glass windows to the built-in cabinets and furniture, so that all celebrated the beauty of nature and the medieval guild ideal.</p>\n"

Webb and Morris met while working in London for the architect G. E. Street. &nbsp;Webb would go on to be one of the major architects of the Gothic Revival movement in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris wanted the house to be a place that reflected his ideals and celebrated art, craftsmanship, and community. &nbsp;Morris and Webb collaborated to make the house&rsquo;s architecture and interior design merge into a unified whole. This&nbsp;would provide the appropriate atmosphere to foster domestic harmony and instill creative energy in its inhabitants and visitors. &nbsp;It was the first home built according to the principles of fine artistry and utility that became the hallmark of the design firm Morris founded with Webb in 1861, as well as the emerging Arts and Crafts movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris and Webb designed the house in a simplified Tudor Gothic style. The features of this style include&nbsp;historicizing elements such as steep roofs, prominent chimneys, cross gables, and exposed-beam ceilings, all&nbsp;present in Red House. &nbsp;Morris was influenced by Ruskin and other theorists who saw the Gothic as a time of perfection in the craft and building trades, as well as a period of great faith and belief in human dignity. &nbsp;They also viewed the Gothic as a more suitable style for&nbsp;Northern Europe because it&nbsp;originated in France, a northern country, as opposed to the classical forms of ancient Greece and Rome. &nbsp;For Morris and Webb, the adoption of a specifically English form of Gothic architecture seemed natural and appropriate to the site.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>A medieval ideal</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The use of exposed red brick for the exterior both gave the house its name and reveals the innate beauty of the construction materials. Morris and Webb valued the specific beauty of natural materials, which they saw as far superior to and healthier than industrially produced materials. Red House is L-shaped, with the rooms laid out for maximum efficiency and clarity. The L-shaped plan also allows the house to embrace the gardens as a part of the domestic sphere, as well as creates an asymmetry that is typical of traditional Gothic structures that were built over long periods of time. The concept of an integral whole extended to the interior design as well.&nbsp;Webb, Morris, his wife, Jane, and the painter Edward Burne-Jones all worked together to design everything in the home, from the wallpaper to the stained-glass windows to the built-in cabinets and furniture, so that all celebrated the beauty of nature and the medieval guild ideal.</p>\n"

"<p>Unfortunately Morris had to sell Red House in 1865 due to financial difficulties. &nbsp;It remained a private residence until 2003, when it was acquired by the National Trust of Great Britain. The architecture of Red House has not been significantly altered, but most of the original furniture is gone and some of the original wall paintings have been covered with modern reproductions of wallpaper Morris produced after he established his design company with Webb and like-minded colleagues. Red House&nbsp;now functions as a museum and is open to the public.</p>\n"

"<h3>Background</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Completed in four months, from October 1800 to January 1801, it signals the dawning of a new century. After a decade of terror and uncertainty following the Revolution, France was emerging as a great power once more. At the heart of this revival, of course, was General Napoleon Bonaparte who, in 1799, had staged an uprising against the revolutionary government (a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat), installed himself as First Consul, and effectively become the most powerful man in France (a few years later he will declare himself emperor).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In May 1800 he led his troops across the Alps in a military campaign against the Austrians which ended in their defeat in June at the Battle of Marengo. It is this achievement the painting commemorates. The portrait was commissioned by Charles IV, then King of Spain, &nbsp;to be hung in a gallery of paintings of other great military leaders housed in the Royal Palace in Madrid.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Napoleon and the Portrait</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Famously, Napoleon offered David little support in executing the painting. Refusing to sit for it, he argued that: &ldquo;Nobody knows if the portraits of the great men resemble them, it is enough that their genius lives there.&rdquo; All David had to work from was an earlier portrait and the uniform Napoleon had worn at Marengo. One of David&rsquo;s sons stood in for him, dressed up in the uniform and perched on top of a ladder. This probably accounts for the youthful physique of the figure.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Napoleon, however, was not entirely divorced from the process. He was the one who settled on the idea of an equestrian portrait: &ldquo;calme sur un cheval fougueux&rdquo; (calm on a fiery horse), were his instructions to the artist. And David duly obliged. What better way, after all, to demonstrate Napoleon&#39;s ability to to wield power with sound judgment and composure. The fact that Napoleon did not actually lead his troops over the Alps but followed a couple of days after them, travelling on a narrow path on the back of a mule is not the point!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Description</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many equestrian portraits, a genre favoured by royalty, <em>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</em> is a portrait of authority. Napoleon is pictured astride a rearing Arabian stallion. Before him to his left we see a mountain, while in the background, largely obscured by rocks, French troops haul along a large canon and further down the line fly the tricolore (the national flag of France) .&nbsp;</p>\n"

On the rock to the bottom left (below), for instance, the name of Napoleon is carved beside the names of Hannibal and Charlemagne&mdash;two other notable figures who led their troops over the Alps.

Taking the point further, if with that outstretched arm and billowing cloak, his body seems to echo the landscape, the reverse might equally hold true, that it is the landscape that echoes him, and is ultimately mastered by his will. David seems to suggest that this man, whose achievements will be celebrated for centuries to come, can do just about anything.</p>\n"

"<p>In 1801 David was awarded the position of Premier Peintre (First Painter) to Napoleon. One may wonder how he felt about this new role.

And perhaps it was a source of pride for him to help secure Napoleon&rsquo;s public image. Significantly, he signs and dates <em>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</em> on the horse&rsquo;s breastplate, a device used to hold the saddle firmly in place. The breastplate also serves as a constraint, though, and given his later huge commissions, such as <em>The Coronation of Napoleon</em>, one wonders if David&rsquo;s creative genius was inhibited as a result of his hero&rsquo;s patronage.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Apart from the salon</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The group of artists who became known as the Impressionists did something ground-breaking&nbsp;in addition to painting&nbsp;their sketchy, light-filled canvases: they established their own exhibition. This may not seem like much in an era like ours, when art galleries are everywhere in major cities, but in Paris at this time, there was&nbsp;one official,&nbsp;state-sponsored&nbsp;exhibition&mdash;called the Salon&mdash;and very few art galleries devoted to&nbsp;the work of living artists. For most of the nineteenth century then,&nbsp;the Salon was the only way to exhibit your work (and therefore the only way to establish your reptutation and&nbsp;make a living as an artist). The works exhibited at the Salon were chosen by a jury&mdash;which could often be quite arbitrary. The artists we know today as Impressionists&mdash;Claude Monet,&nbsp;August Renoir,&nbsp;Edgar Degas,&nbsp;Berthe Morisot, Alfred Sisley (and several others)&mdash;could not afford to wait for France to accept their work. They all had experienced rejection by the Salon jury in recent years and felt that waiting an entire year between exhibitions wastoo long. They needed to show their work and they wanted to sell it.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The artists pooled their money, rented a studio that&nbsp;belonged to the&nbsp;photographer Nadar, and set a date for their first collective exhibition. They called themselves the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Printmakers and their first show&nbsp;opened at about the same time as the annual Salon in&nbsp;May 1874. The Impressionists held eight exhibitions from 1874 through 1886.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>The impressionists regarded Manet as their inspiration and leader in their spirit of revolution, but Manet had no desire to join their cooperative venture into independent exhibitions. Manet had set up his own pavilion during the 1867 World&rsquo;s Fair, but he was not interested in giving up on the Salon jury.

"<h3>Apart from the salon</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The group of artists who became known as the Impressionists did something ground-breaking&nbsp;in addition to painting&nbsp;their sketchy, light-filled canvases: they esetablished their own exhibition. This may not seem like much in an era like ours, when art galleries are everywhere in major cities, but in Paris at this time, there was&nbsp;one official,&nbsp;state-sponsored&nbsp;exhibition&mdash;called the Salon&mdash;and very few art galleries devoted to&nbsp;the work of living artists. For most of the nineteenth century then,&nbsp;the Salon was the only way to exhibit your work (and therefore the only way to establish your reptutation and&nbsp;make a living as an artist). The works exhibited at the Salon were chosen by a jury&mdash;which could often be quite arbitrary. The artists we know today as Impressionists&mdash;Claude Monet,&nbsp;August Renoir,&nbsp;Edgar Degas,&nbsp;Berthe Morisot, Alfred Sisley (and several others)&mdash;could not afford to wait for France to accept their work. They all had experienced rejection by the Salon jury in recent years and felt that waiting an entire year between exhibitions wastoo long. They needed to show their work and they wanted to sell it.</p>\n"

"<p><span>The impressionists regarded Manet as their inspiration and leader in their spirit of revolution, but Manet had no desire to join their cooperative venture into independent exhibitions.

It was given to the museum by Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney along with six other masterpieces by Van Gogh, Matisse, and Picasso. Some gift. Still, the painting is a bit difficult to understand. At first, the structure of space is straight-forward. As expected, there is a foreground (the green foliage at the bottom), a middleground (the road and houses) and an area of deep recession (the sky).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Spatial distortion</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each of these zones are largely defined by color; green for the bushes in front, a warm ocher for the middle plane (road and houses), and blue for the sky. It is here that C&eacute;zanne begins to play tricks. Having rejected clear linear or atmospheric perspective as a means of constructing recessionary illusion, C&eacute;zanne relies on the clues afforded by scale, overlapping, and color.

"<p>Even as we see the three zones of space in relation to each other, the painting seems oddly flat, as if the sky were pulled forward and the foreground were pushed back. Of course we still see the illusion, but even as we see the space that C&eacute;zanne&#39;s line insists upon, the painting looks too much like three flat planes resting atop each other and the painting begins to remind us that it is, in fact, a vertical curtain.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>There are two means by which C&eacute;zanne has sabotaged the space of this canvas (unfortunately the effect is muted in reproduction and even more so on the computer screen--so trust me on this). The first is brushwork. In an Old Master landscape, the greatest detail and the most delicate brushwork exist in the foreground. The movements of the brush get broader and more generalized as space moves back.

Have you noticed that in the middle of the sky, just to the left of the church steeple and the tree, there is a small smudge of brown paint. It is the same ocher used to render the shadows in the road and on the roofs. What is this?&nbsp;Have you ever seen a dense brown smudge just floating in the sky? I don&#39;t think so.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Mistakes on purpose</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>So what are we as the viewer to make of it? Is it a mistake? Was C&eacute;zanne a dottering old man by 1898, who accidently hit the canvas as his arms flailed about and then was too lazy to wipe it out and repaint that section? No. So what is it then? Well, when you look at the ochre smudge, what happens to the deep space of the sky? Do you notice how the ochre smudge refuses to sit back in deep space but instead pushes forward toward the middle plane of the houses?&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When seen in person, the brown paint that hangs in the sky actually brings the sky with it, denying the illusion of deep space entirely. Also, note the bright sky blues in the foreground bushes. Just as the ochre spot in the sky forces the sky forward, so the clear blues that oddly appear within the viewer&#39;s reach, punch holes in the solidity of the foreground. The brown in the back pushes forward and the blue in the front pushes back. The result is a flattening of space or perhaps a more honest expression of the true flatness of the canvas.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Background</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Place de la Madeleine had been consecrated as a site devoted to Mary Magdalene in 1182. During the period known as the First Republic (1792-1804), following the French Revolution, the foundations of earlier sacred buildings were removed and discussions were had as to what to do with the space. As France had been de-Christianized during the Revolution a civic rather than a religious function for the building was decided upon; various suggestions were put forward including a new site for the Bank of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Considerations were brought to a halt, however, when in 1804 Napoleon crowned himself Emperor. What followed was one of the most ambitious propaganda programs of the nineteenth century.

"<h3>The Pediment Frieze</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In contrast to the Napoleonic design of the temple, the pediment frieze, designed by Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire in 1829, is a masterpiece of Bourbon Restoration propaganda. The subject is&nbsp;<em>The Last Judgment</em>, a centuries-old motif found on relief sculptures above the doors of countless churches and cathedrals. While Lemaire largely follows iconographical convention, depicting Christ the Judge at the center of the composition and on His right the archangel Gabriel with his horn announcing the Day of Judgment and on His left the archangel Michael wielding the sword of justice, it is in the figure of Mary Magdalene kneeling at the foot of Christ that the underlying message of the sculpture is revealed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Mary Magdalene has very strong connections with France. According to tradition she&nbsp;was among the first Christian proselytizers:&nbsp;after the crucifixion she journeyed to Provence from the Holy Land converting the French to Christianity. She is also, of course&mdash;albeit wrongly&mdash;often portrayed in art and in literature as a repentant prostitute, as indeed she is here; notice, for example the contrast between the virtuous female figures to the right whose bodies are concealed and her own state of semi-nakedness.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>背景</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Place de la Madeleine had been consecrated as a site devoted to Mary Magdalene in 1182. During the period known as the First Republic (1792-1804), following the French Revolution, the foundations of earlier sacred buildings were removed and discussions were had as to what to do with the space. As France had been de-Christianized during the Revolution a civic rather than a religious function for the building was decided upon; various suggestions were put forward including a new site for the Bank of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Considerations were brought to a halt, however, when in 1804 Napoleon crowned himself Emperor. What followed was one of the most ambitious propaganda programs of the nineteenth century. As well as looting works from the world&rsquo;s finest collections to display in the newly refurbished Louvre, renamed the Mus&eacute;e Napoleon, some of the greatest artists and sculptors of the age were recruited to exalt the new emperor. It was only fitting that Napoleon would turn to architects, too, to realize his vision of an imperial capital city.

"<h3>Artistic Exchange</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the 2nd millennium, the region&nbsp;of Mesopotamia, with Assyria in the north and Babylonia in the south, together with Egypt and the Hittite lands in what is now modern Turkey, grew strong and exercised surprisingly harmonious political relations.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Babylonia at this time was held by the Kassites,&nbsp;originally from the Zagros mountains to the north, who sought to imitate Mesopotamian styles of art. &nbsp;Kudurru (boundary markers) are&nbsp;the only significant remains of the Kassites, many of which show Kassite gods and activities translated into the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visual style of Mesopotamia.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Despite the Holocaust, significant Jewish populations&nbsp;survived&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;Europe especially&nbsp;in Russia, the United Kingdom, and France while Jews in&nbsp;Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,&nbsp;Greece, Yugoslavia, Germany and Austria were reduced to a tiny fraction of their prewar numbers.&nbsp;Jews everywhere&nbsp;struggled to invent a&nbsp;new post-Holocaust identity. </span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Western European nations received substantial aid from the American government, and the Jewish populations in&nbsp;those areas relied on American Jewish organizations for help.&nbsp;The geographic centers of Hasidism in Eastern Europe were disproportionately destroyed during the Holocaust, but many sects continue to thrive on almost every continent. In 1948&nbsp;the United Nations unanimously voted for an independent State of Israel (the area was at that time under British administration).</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Aftermath</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the immediate aftermath of the war in Eastern Europe, the Soviets continued to downplay the role of race, as they had during the Holocaust, but while many Jews were devoted Communists, they were once again targeted as a suspicious people who could never truly be trusted comrades. Especially during the Soviet show trials in the 1950s and 1960s, Jews were purged from government ranks and executed in public spaces. &nbsp;Although Stalin voted for the creation of Israel in 1948, these public show trials served as &ldquo;a form of public-pedagogy-by-example;&rdquo; the goal was to exemplify the fact that ethnic Jews did not belong among the Communist ranks, that they were not equal with others. Even in the secular Soviet Union, overt antisemitism persisted during the Cold War decades. Many Jews made their way out from behind the iron curtain toward Western Europe, Israel, or the United States.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>American Jews in the 1950s followed the patterns of other white ethnic immigrant populations. Many left large cities, focused on education, and joined counter-cultural movements in the late 1960s and 70s. American Jews often stood at the side of the oppressed, figuring prominently in the 1960s civil&nbsp;rights movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Jews in Islamic lands emigrated from North African and Middle Eastern countries between the late 1940s and late 1960s when pan-Arab nationalism became exclusively Muslim and precluded participation from others. These Jews immigrated to Israel, Western Europe, and the United States.&nbsp;In France, the Sephardic population from Algeria, Morrocco and Tunisia brought new religious life and diverse customs to a community that&nbsp;was struggling after the trauma of World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish identity now</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the modern world, Jewish identity can seem scattered, confusing, and boundless. In the United States, Jews thrived in the postwar decades&nbsp;and several different movements gained popularity: Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist.&nbsp;In Europe and Israel, inspired by these American movements, a smaller fraction of progressive Jews have formed Liberal or other kinds of Judaism. From the 1990s to the present, some American Jews have joined in a worldwide trend toward religious extremism. &nbsp;At the same time, the Reform movement has grown. The traditional separation between men and women has been broken down and women are now integrated into the rabbinate in non-Orthodox circles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art Spiegelman, the artist and author of <em>Maus</em>, recently reflected, &ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s become questionable to me is the way in which the Holocaust has become a central tenant of Jewishness in the late 20th century&hellip;. So that people see it as a Jewish problem and not a world problem.&rdquo; &nbsp;The omnipresence of Holocaust education within the Jewish community combined with a sort of alienation from tradition, made the Holocaust into the unifying agent that brought Jews together. In the twenty-first century, young Jews have pushed against the Holocaust as the defining feature of their Jewishness and have sought out alternative ways to express their connections to Judaism. Jewish film, music, and cultural festivals abound, attracting Jewish and non-Jewish audiences. The largest such festival occurs annually in Poland and draws tens of thousands from across the globe&mdash;that this festival takes place in the country where the greatest number of Jews were massacred during the Holocaust, signals a turn away from that dark period as the benchmark of Jewish identity and toward new forms of Jewish expression.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One popular joke says that Jews believe in &ldquo;at most&rdquo; one God. While monotheism is an important feature of Judaism, some of the greatest Rabbis from the Talmud have atheist tendencies, even as they espouse the centrality of Halakhah. As the scholar Shaye J.D. Cohen has written, &ldquo;Jewishness, like most&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;other identities, is imagined; it has no empirical objective, verifiable reality to which we can point and over which we can exclaim, &lsquo;This is it!&rsquo; &nbsp;Jewishness is in the mind.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Lacking any unifying authority, doctrine, or practice, Judaism is highly diverse and cannot be pared down to any singular concept. Instead, a set of features like common texts, a shared history, and the rhythms of religious Jewish life can help us understand a religion shaped as much by its ancient origins as its contemporary disjointedness.</p>\n"

"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b35b3f63c6baecd48e43e2f0cda0d99dad2a81fe.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Anselm Kiefer, <em>Shulamite [Sulamith]</em>, 1983, oil, emulsion, woodcut, shellac, acrylic, and straw on canvas, 541 x 368.3 cm (Doris and Donald Fisher Collection). &copy; Anselm Kiefer, courtesy of the artist. &quot;Born in Germany just months shy of the end of World War II, Anselm Kiefer came of age in the late 1960s when the silence surrounding the crimes of the Nazi regime was ruptured by a vocal younger generation horrified by their collective German &ldquo;past,&rdquo; struggling to reconcile such shame and redefine what it meant to be German in a post-Nazi world.&quot; &mdash;Rebecca Taylor</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Despite the Holocaust, significant Jewish populations&nbsp;survived&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;Europe especially&nbsp;in Russia, the United Kingdom, and France while Jews in&nbsp;Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,&nbsp;Greece, Yugoslavia, Germany and Austria were reduced to a tiny fraction of their prewar numbers.&nbsp;Jews everywhere&nbsp;struggled to invent a&nbsp;new post-Holocaust identity. </span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Western European nations received substantial aid from the American government, and the Jewish populations in&nbsp;those areas relied on American Jewish organizations for help.&nbsp;The geographic centers of Hasidism in Eastern Europe were disproportionately destroyed during the Holocaust, but many sects continue to thrive on almost every continent. In 1948&nbsp;the United Nations unanimously voted for an independent State of Israel (the area was at that time under British administration).</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Aftermath</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the immediate aftermath of the war in Eastern Europe, the Soviets continued to downplay the role of race, as they had during the Holocaust, but while many Jews were devoted Communists, they were once again targeted as a suspicious people who could never truly be trusted comrades. Especially during the Soviet show trials in the 1950s and 1960s, Jews were purged from government ranks and executed in public spaces. &nbsp;Although Stalin voted for the creation of Israel in 1948, these public show trials served as &ldquo;a form of public-pedagogy-by-example;&rdquo; the goal was to exemplify the fact that ethnic Jews did not belong among the Communist ranks, that they were not equal with others. Even in the secular Soviet Union, overt antisemitism persisted during the Cold War decades. Many Jews made their way out from behind the iron curtain toward Western Europe, Israel, or the United States.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>American Jews in the 1950s followed the patterns of other white ethnic immigrant populations. Many left large cities, focused on education, and joined counter-cultural movements in the late 1960s and 70s. American Jews often stood at the side of the oppressed, figuring prominently in the 1960s civil&nbsp;rights movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Jews in Islamic lands emigrated from North African and Middle Eastern countries between the late 1940s and late 1960s when pan-Arab nationalism became exclusively Muslim and precluded participation from others. These Jews immigrated to Israel, Western Europe, and the United States.&nbsp;In France, the Sephardic population from Algeria, Morrocco and Tunisia brought new religious life and diverse customs to a community that&nbsp;was struggling after the trauma of World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish identity now</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the modern world, Jewish identity can seem scattered, confusing, and boundless. In the United States, Jews thrived in the postwar decades&nbsp;and several different movements gained popularity: Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist.&nbsp;In Europe and Israel, inspired by these American movements, a smaller fraction of progressive Jews have formed Liberal or other kinds of Judaism. From the 1990s to the present, some American Jews have joined in a worldwide trend toward religious extremism. &nbsp;At the same time, the Reform movement has grown. The traditional separation between men and women has been broken down and women are now integrated into the rabbinate in non-Orthodox circles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art Spiegelman, the artist and author of <em>Maus</em>, recently reflected, &ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s become questionable to me is the way in which the Holocaust has become a central tenant of Jewishness in the late 20th century&hellip;. So that people see it as a Jewish problem and not a world problem.&rdquo; &nbsp;The omnipresence of Holocaust education within the Jewish community combined with a sort of alienation from tradition, made the Holocaust into the unifying agent that brought Jews together. In the twenty-first century, young Jews have pushed against the Holocaust as the defining feature of their Jewishness and have sought out alternative ways to express their connections to Judaism. Jewish film, music, and cultural festivals abound, attracting Jewish and non-Jewish audiences. The largest such festival occurs annually in Poland and draws tens of thousands from across the globe&mdash;that this festival takes place in the country where the greatest number of Jews were massacred during the Holocaust, signals a turn away from that dark period as the benchmark of Jewish identity and toward new forms of Jewish expression.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One popular joke says that Jews believe in &ldquo;at most&rdquo; one God. While monotheism is an important feature of Judaism, some of the greatest Rabbis from the Talmud have atheist tendencies, even as they espouse the centrality of Halakhah. As the scholar Shaye J.D. Cohen has written, &ldquo;Jewishness, like most&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;other identities, is imagined; it has no empirical objective, verifiable reality to which we can point and over which we can exclaim, &lsquo;This is it!&rsquo; &nbsp;Jewishness is in the mind.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Lacking any unifying authority, doctrine, or practice, Judaism is highly diverse and cannot be pared down to any singular concept. Instead, a set of features like common texts, a shared history, and the rhythms of religious Jewish life can help us understand a religion shaped as much by its ancient origins as its contemporary disjointedness.</p>\n"

"<h3>Breaking postwar silence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Born in Germany just months shy of the end of World War II, Anselm Kiefer came of age in the late 1960s when the silence surrounding the crimes of the Nazi regime was ruptured by a vocal younger generation horrified by their collective German &ldquo;past,&rdquo; struggling to reconcile such shame and redefine what it meant to be German in a post-Nazi world.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For Kiefer, who had studied with the artists Peter Dreher in Karlsruhe and Joseph Beuys in Dusseldorf, painting became the arena to vocalize and elucidate his contempt for the Nazis and their reprehensible legacy, instilling every brush stroke with palpable rage, grief, and shame. In the 1970s, Kiefer developed a signature style that was influenced in part by the Neo-expressionist style of Georg Baselitz, but also by his teacher Beuys, particularly Beuys&rsquo;s tendency to use commonplace materials, such as fat and felt within his artistic practice. Kiefer augmented his thick layers of impasto with lead, glass, straw, wood, dried flowers, and more, yielding highly textured, viscous surfaces. As his list of materials grew, so too did the scale of his canvases, which though large and formidable, felt ephemeral and fragile as a result of the materials he utilized.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A thick impasto</h3>\n"
"\n"

"<h3>Breaking postwar silence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Born in Germany just months shy of the end of World War II, Anselm Kiefer came of age in the late 1960s when the silence surrounding the crimes of the Nazi regime was ruptured by a vocal younger generation horrified by their collective German &ldquo;past,&rdquo; struggling to reconcile such shame and redefine what it meant to be German in a post-Nazi world.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For Kiefer, who had studied with the artists Peter Dreher in Karlsruhe and Joseph Beuys in Dusseldorf, painting became the arena to vocalize and elucidate his contempt for the Nazis and their reprehensible legacy, instilling every brush stroke with palpable rage, grief, and shame. In the 1970s, Kiefer developed a signature style that was influenced in part by the Neo-expressionist style of Georg Baselitz, but also by his teacher Beuys, particularly Beuys&rsquo;s tendency to use commonplace materials, such as fat and felt within his artistic practice. Kiefer augmented his thick layers of impasto with lead, glass, straw, wood, dried flowers, and more, yielding highly textured, viscous surfaces. As his list of materials grew, so too did the scale of his canvases, which though large and formidable, felt ephemeral and fragile as a result of the materials he utilized.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Objects that seem at first glance made of gold are more complex and are in fact made of metal alloys.

"\n"
"<p>The creation of alloys also allowed for differences in color, ranging from reddish to golden tones.

"<p>Small ingots of tumbaga, in the shape of round buttons, were crafted into unique objects either by hammering or casting them (or by a combination of both techniques). Ancient Colombian artists mastered both techniques to an unprecedented degree, creating exceptional works of art.</p>\n"

"<p>Hammering metal was a delicate process. Metal becomes easily brittle when hammered and they have to be repeatedly cooled and dipped in water before the final form is achieved. The thin sheets of gold were then cut, decorated (for example by repouss&eacute;) or joined by clipping or folding several sheets together.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, it was the casting of metals that was developed most in ancient Colombia. Using the lost wax technique, artist modeled the final piece they wanted to achieve in beeswax (from stingless bees). Once the wax figure was finished it was covered in fine clay and charcoal, leaving pouring channels. The whole mold was fired and the melted wax poured out. Its place would be taken by molten metal, which cooled slowly as it solidified inside the mould. The mould was then broken and the final metal piece polished and finished.<br />\n"

This is an object that invites close looking to fully appreciate&nbsp;the process by which colorful beads animate the bag, making a dazzling object and showcasing remarkable technical skill.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What is a Bandolier Bag?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags&nbsp;are based on bags carried by European soldiers armed with rifles, who used the bags to store ammunition cartridges.&nbsp;While Bandolier Bags were made by different tribes and First Nations across the Great Lakes and Prairie regions, they differ in appearance. The stylistic differences are the result of personal preference as much&nbsp;contact with Europeans and Euro-Americans, goods acquired in trade, and travel.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, based in Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1d6933c0f66fe02dbc29473dab9677a553e9aa7f.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe,&nbsp;Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in New York City&nbsp;has a wonderful example of a Bandolier Bag, most likely&nbsp;made by a Lenape artist (the Lenape are part of the Delaware tribe or First Nation, who lived along the Delaware River and parts of what is today New York State).&nbsp;[2]</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags (like this&nbsp;one) are often large in size and decorated with a wide array of colorful beads and ribbons. They are worn as a cross-body bag, with a thick strap crossing a person&rsquo;s chest to allow it to rest on the hip.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These bags were especially popular in the late nineteenth century in the Eastern or Woodlands region, which comprised parts of what is today Canada and the United States. The Woodlands area encompasses the Great Lakes Region and terrain east of the Mississippi River. This enormous geographic area has a long, complex history including the production of&nbsp;objects we today recognize as&nbsp;&ldquo;art,&rdquo;&nbsp;that date back more than 4,000 years.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Map: the Eastern Woodlands extended roughly from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern Great Plains, and from the Great Lakes region to the Gulf of Mexico.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3e227b06a299936f0a28c91436bb8798f95399dd.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">The Eastern Woodlands (on the map above &quot;Northeast&quot; and &quot;Southeast&quot;)&nbsp;extended roughly from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern Great Plains, and from the Great Lakes region to the Gulf of Mexico.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags were created across this vast expanse of land, and the NMAI has examples from the Upper Great Lakes region and Oklahoma. Due to events and laws like the Indian Removal Act of 1830 (signed by President Andrew Jackson), the Lenape&nbsp;were forcibly removed from these ancestral lands and relocated to areas of Oklahoma,&nbsp;Wisconsin, and&nbsp;Ontario, Canada. Despite these traumatic relocations, tribes like the Lenape continued to create objects as they had in ancestral lands. Bandolier bags are one example of this continued artistic production.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Material&nbsp;and design</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: Wisconsin Historical Society)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9eb4a521e72465e3909c51906cb5778c437af655.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/exhibits/p2p/red/impressions.asp\">Wisconsin Historical Society</a>)</span></span>While men most commonly wore these bags, women created them. Initially, Bandolier&nbsp;Bags did not have a pocket, but were intended to complement men&rsquo;s ceremonial outfits. Men even wore more than one bag on occasion, dressing themselves in a rainbow of colors and patterns. Even those bags with pockets weren&rsquo;t necessarily always used to hold objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Women typically produced Bandolier Bags using trade cloth, made from cotton or wool. It is often possible to see the exposed unembroidered trade cloth underneath the cross-body strap. The NMAI bag (above) uses animal hide in addition to the cotton cloth, combining materials that had long been used among these groups (animal hides) with new materials (cotton trade cloth).&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beads and other materials were embroidered on the trade cloth and hide. The tiny glass beads, called seed beads, were acquired from European traders, and they were prized for their brilliant colors. Glass beads replaced porcupine quillwork, which had&nbsp;a longstanding history in this area. Before the use of glass beads, porcupine quills were acquired (carefully!), softened and dyed. Once they were malleable enough to bend, the quills were woven onto the surfaces of objects (especially&nbsp;clothing or other cloth&nbsp;goods like bags).

This is an object that invites close looking to fully appreciate&nbsp;the process by which colorful beads animate the bag, making a dazzling object and showcasing remarkable technical skill.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What is a Bandolier Bag?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags&nbsp;are based on bags carried by European soldiers armed with rifles, who used the bags to store ammunition cartridges.&nbsp;While Bandolier Bags were made by different tribes and First Nations across the Great Lakes and Prairie regions, they differ in appearance. The stylistic differences are the result of personal preference as much&nbsp;contact with Europeans and Euro-Americans, goods acquired in trade, and travel.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\n"

"\n"
"<p>The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in New York City&nbsp;has a wonderful example of a Bandolier Bag, most likely&nbsp;made by a Lenape artist (the Lenape are part of the Delaware tribe or First Nation, who lived along the Delaware River and parts of what is today New York State).&nbsp;[2]</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags (like this&nbsp;one) are often large in size and decorated with a wide array of colorful beads and ribbons. They are worn as a cross-body bag, with a thick strap crossing a person&rsquo;s chest to allow it to rest on the hip.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These bags were especially popular in the late nineteenth century in the Eastern or Woodlands region, which comprised parts of what is today Canada and the United States. The Woodlands area encompasses the Great Lakes Region and terrain east of the Mississippi River. This enormous geographic area has a long, complex history including the production of&nbsp;objects we today recognize as&nbsp;&ldquo;art,&rdquo;&nbsp;that date back more than 4,000 years.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Map: the Eastern Woodlands extended roughly from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern Great Plains, and from the Great Lakes region to the Gulf of Mexico.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3e227b06a299936f0a28c91436bb8798f95399dd.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">The Eastern Woodlands (on the map above &quot;Northeast&quot; and &quot;Southeast&quot;)&nbsp;extended roughly from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern Great Plains, and from the Great Lakes region to the Gulf of Mexico.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags were created across this vast expanse of land, and the NMAI has examples from the Upper Great Lakes region and Oklahoma. Due to events and laws like the Indian Removal Act of 1830 (signed by President Andrew Jackson), the Lenape&nbsp;were forcibly removed from these ancestral lands and relocated to areas of Oklahoma,&nbsp;Wisconsin, and&nbsp;Ontario, Canada. Despite these traumatic relocations, tribes like the Lenape continued to create objects as they had in ancestral lands. Bandolier bags are one example of this continued artistic production.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Material&nbsp;and design</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: Wisconsin Historical Society)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9eb4a521e72465e3909c51906cb5778c437af655.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/exhibits/p2p/red/impressions.asp\">Wisconsin Historical Society</a>)</span></span>While men most commonly wore these bags, women created them. Initially, Bandolier&nbsp;Bags did not have a pocket, but were intended to complement men&rsquo;s ceremonial outfits. Men even wore more than one bag on occasion, dressing themselves in a rainbow of colors and patterns. Even those bags with pockets weren&rsquo;t necessarily always used to hold objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Women typically produced Bandolier Bags using trade cloth, made from cotton or wool. It is often possible to see the exposed unembroidered trade cloth underneath the cross-body strap. The NMAI bag (above) uses animal hide in addition to the cotton cloth, combining materials that had long been used among these groups (animal hides) with new materials (cotton trade cloth).&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beads and other materials were embroidered on the trade cloth and hide. The tiny glass beads, called seed beads, were acquired from European traders, and they were prized for their brilliant colors. Glass beads replaced porcupine quillwork, which had&nbsp;a longstanding history in this area. Before the use of glass beads, porcupine quills were acquired (carefully!), softened and dyed. Once they were malleable enough to bend, the quills were woven onto the surfaces of objects (especially&nbsp;clothing or other cloth&nbsp;goods like bags). Quillwork required different working techniques than embroidering with beads, so people adopted new methods for&nbsp;decorating the surfaces of bags, clothing, and other goods.</p>\n"

"<h3>The style of the French nobility</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Encased in the curving frame and delicate decorative scheme of this writing table are clever innovations, technological and artistic brilliance, and a representation of completely new ways of living in the period beginning c. 1755.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After the formality and grandeur of Louis XIV&rsquo;s Versailles, French aristocrats, including the king himself, were ready for spaces, furniture, clothing, and etiquette that allowed them to turn to matters other than the glorification of France. Beginning before the turn of the 18th century, but accelerated by the opportunity opened by the death of the Sun King in 1715, nobles set up their own homes after decades of living under the king&rsquo;s enormous roof at Versailles, and created a radically different domestic life. Although it was only seven years until Louis XIV&rsquo;s great-grandson was old enough to take the throne to reign as Louis XV, by 1722 new ideas of privacy, comfort, and intimate home life led to a new design language, the Rococo. All of the elements that are the basis for domesticity as we know it today were developed in this period.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A move away from Baroque grandeur and classicism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Louis XIV, during his long reign, had established France as a major European economic and political power, not least by the use of design as a strategic propaganda tool. Where the grandeur, drama, and theatricality of the Baroque, as Louis imported it from Rome, had been the perfect tool for portraying the King and his country as supremely powerful, by the early 18th century, the Baroque was starting to seem exhaustingly sumptuous. Baroque design was based on the classical language, which the earlier Renaissance artists had delighted in rediscovering, augmenting, and modifying. But by the early decades of the 18th century, designers were increasingly turning away from bombastic classicism to other sources, notably the natural world. They began playing with un-classical ideas like asymmetry, movement, linearity, sinuous curves, and realistic natural ornament.

"<h3>The style of the French nobility</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Encased in the curving frame and delicate decorative scheme of this writing table are clever innovations, technological and artistic brilliance, and a representation of completely new ways of living in the period beginning c. 1755.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After the formality and grandeur of Louis XIV&rsquo;s Versailles, French aristocrats, including the king himself, were ready for spaces, furniture, clothing, and etiquette that allowed them to turn to matters other than the glorification of France. Beginning before the turn of the 18th century, but accelerated by the opportunity opened by the death of the Sun King in 1715, nobles set up their own homes after decades of living under the king&rsquo;s enormous roof at Versailles, and created a radically different domestic life. Although it was only seven years until Louis XIV&rsquo;s great-grandson was old enough to take the throne to reign as Louis XV, by 1722 new ideas of privacy, comfort, and intimate home life led to a new design language, the Rococo. All of the elements that are the basis for domesticity as we know it today were developed in this period.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A move away from Baroque grandeur and classicism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Louis XIV, during his long reign, had established France as a major European economic and political power, not least by the use of design as a strategic propaganda tool. Where the grandeur, drama, and theatricality of the Baroque, as Louis imported it from Rome, had been the perfect tool for portraying the King and his country as supremely powerful, by the early 18th century, the Baroque was starting to seem exhaustingly sumptuous. Baroque design was based on the classical language, which the earlier Renaissance artists had delighted in rediscovering, augmenting, and modifying. But by the early decades of the 18th century, designers were increasingly turning away from bombastic classicism to other sources, notably the natural world. They began playing with un-classical ideas like asymmetry, movement, linearity, sinuous curves, and realistic natural ornament. The Rococo, as it developed in design, was a sharp turn away from everything the Baroque had become. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In 1226 a French king died, leaving his queen to rule his kingdom until their son came of age. The 38-year-old widow, Blanche of Castile, had her work cut out for her. Rebelling barons were eager to win back lands that her husband&rsquo;s father had seized from them. They rallied troops against her, defamed her character, and even accused her of adultery and murder.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Caught in a perilous web of treachery, insurrections, and open warfare, Blanche persuaded, cajoled, negotiated, and fought would-be enemies after her husband, King Louis VIII, died of dysentery after only a three-year reign.

"<h3>A manuscript illumination</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A dazzling illumination in New York&rsquo;s Morgan Library could well depict Blanche of Castile and her son Louis, a beardless youth crowned king. A cleric and a scribe are depicted underneath them. Each figure is set against a ground of burnished gold, seated beneath a trefoil arch. Stylized and colorful buildings dance above their heads, suggesting a sophisticated, urban setting&mdash;perhaps Paris, the capital city of the Capetian kingdom (the Capetians were one of the oldest royal families in France) and home to a renowned school of theology.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A moralized Bible&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This last page the New York Morgan Library&rsquo;s manuscript MS M 240 is the last quire (folded page) of a three-volume moralized bible, the majority of which is housed at the Cathedral Treasury in Toledo, Spain. Moralized bibles, made expressedly for the French royal house, include lavishly illustrated abbreviated passages from the Old and New Testaments. Explanatory texts that allude to historical events and tales accompany these literary and visual readings, which&mdash;woven together&mdash;convey a moral.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Assuming historians are correct in identifying the two rulers, we are looking at the four people intensely involved in the production of this manuscript. As patron and ruler, Queen Blanche of Castile would have financed its production. As ruler-to-be, Louis IX&rsquo;s job was to take its lessons to heart along with those from the other biblical and ancient texts that his tutors read with him. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>King and queen&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the upper register, an enthroned king and queen wear the traditional medieval open crown topped with fleur-de-lys&mdash;a stylized iris or lily symbolizing a French monarch&rsquo;s religious, political, and dynastic right to rule. The blue-eyed queen, left, is veiled in a white widow&rsquo;s wimple. An ermine-lined blue mantle drapes over her shoulders. Her pink T-shaped tunic spills over a thin blue edge of paint which visually supports these enthroned figures. A slender green column divides the queen&rsquo;s space from that of her son, King Louis IX, to whom she deliberately gestures across the page, raising her left hand in his direction. Her pose and animated facial expression suggest that she is dedicating this manuscript, with its lessons and morals, to the young king.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Detail of Louis IX, Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France; Author Dictating to a Scribe, Moralized Bible, c. 1230\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ee963dae254d56733ad615fbcde5ea72e91d098e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Detail of Louis IX,<em> Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France; Author Dictating to a Scribe, Moralized Bible</em>, c. 1230</span></span>Louis IX, a trefoiled open crown atop his head, returns his mother&rsquo;s glance. In his right hand he holds a scepter, indicating his kingly status. It is topped by the characteristic fleur-de-lys on which, curiously, a bird sits. A four-pedaled brooch, dominated by a large square of sapphire blue in the center, secures a pink mantle lined with green that rests on his boyish shoulders.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his left hand, between his forefinger and thumb, Louis holds a small golden ball or disc. During the mass that followed coronations, French kings and queens would traditionally give the presiding bishop of Reims 13 gold coins (all French kings were crowned in this northern French cathedral town.) This could reference Louis&rsquo; 1226 coronation, just three weeks after his father&rsquo;s death, suggesting a probable date for this bible&rsquo;s commission. A manuscript this lavish, however, would have taken eight to ten years to complete&mdash;perfect timing, because in 1235, the 21-year-old Louis was ready to assume the rule of his Capetian kingdom from his mother.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A link between earth and heaven</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Coronation of the Virgin, tympanum of central portal, north transept, Chartres Cathedral, c. 1204-10\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6faa2e8422040038119b3e8122aea184fcbba3b4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coronation of the Virgin, tympanum of central portal, north transept, Chartres Cathedral, c. 1204-10</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Queen Blanche and her son, the young king, echo a gesture and pose that would have been familiar to many Christians: the Virgin Mary and Christ enthroned side-by-side as celestial rulers of heaven, found in the numerous Coronations of the Virgin carved in ivory, wood, and stone. This scene was especially prevalent in tympana, the top sculpted semi-circle over cathedral portals found throughout France. On beholding the Morgan illumination, viewers would have immediately made the connection between this earthly Queen Blanche and her son, anointed by God with the divine right to rule, and that of Mary, Queen of heaven and her son, divine figures who offer salvation.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The cleric wears a sleeveless cloak appropriate for divine services&mdash;this is an educated man&mdash;and emphasizes his role as a scholar. He tilts his head forward and points his right forefinger at the artist across from him, as though giving instructions. No clues are given as to this cleric&rsquo;s religious order, as he probably represents the many Parisian theologians responsible for the manuscript&rsquo;s visual and literary content&mdash;all of whom were undoubtedly told to spare no expense.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On the right, the artist, donning a blue surcoat and wearing a cap, is seated on cushioned bench.&nbsp;</p>\n"

We know, from the 4887 medallions that precede this illumination, what&rsquo;s next on this artist&rsquo;s agenda: he will apply a thin sheet of gold leaf onto the background, and then paint the medallion&#39;s biblical and explanatory scenes in brilliant hues of lapis lazuli, green, red, yellow, grey, orange and sepia.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Advice for a king</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Blanche undoubtedly hand-picked the theologians whose job it was to establish this manuscript&rsquo;s guidelines, select biblical passages, write explanations, hire copyists, and oversee the images that the artists should paint. Art and text, mutually dependent, spelled out advice that its readers, Louis IX and perhaps his siblings, could practice in their enlightened rule. The nobles, church officials, and perhaps even common folk who viewed this page could be reassured that their ruler had been well trained to deal with whatever calamities came his way.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This 13th century illumination, both dazzling and edifying, represents the cutting edge of lavishness in a society that embraced conspicuous consumption. As a pedagogical tool, perhaps it played no small part in helping Louis IX achieve the status of sainthood, awarded by Pope Bonifiace VIII 27 years after the king&rsquo;s death. This and other images in the bible moralis&eacute;e explain why Parisian illuminators monopolized manuscript production at this time. Look again at the work. Who else could compete against such a resounding image of character and grace?&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Blanche of Castille</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1226 a French king died, leaving his queen to rule his kingdom until their son came of age. The 38-year-old widow, Blanche of Castile, had her work cut out for her. Rebelling barons were eager to win back lands that her husband&rsquo;s father had seized from them. They rallied troops against her, defamed her character, and even accused her of adultery and murder.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Caught in a perilous web of treachery, insurrections, and open warfare, Blanche persuaded, cajoled, negotiated, and fought would-be enemies after her husband, King Louis VIII, died of dysentery after only a three-year reign. When their son Louis IX took the helm in 1234, he inherited a kingdom that was, for a time anyway, at peace.</p>\n"

"<h3>A manuscript illumination</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A dazzling illumination in New York&rsquo;s Morgan Library could well depict Blanche of Castile and her son Louis, a beardless youth crowned king. A cleric and a scribe are depicted underneath them. Each figure is set against a ground of burnished gold, seated beneath a trefoil arch. Stylized and colorful buildings dance above their heads, suggesting a sophisticated, urban setting&mdash;perhaps Paris, the capital city of the Capetian kingdom (the Capetians were one of the oldest royal families in France) and home to a renowned school of theology.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A moralized Bible&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This last page the New York Morgan Library&rsquo;s manuscript MS M 240 is the last quire (folded page) of a three-volume moralized bible, the majority of which is housed at the Cathedral Treasury in Toledo, Spain. Moralized bibles, made expressedly for the French royal house, include lavishly illustrated abbreviated passages from the Old and New Testaments. Explanatory texts that allude to historical events and tales accompany these literary and visual readings, which&mdash;woven together&mdash;convey a moral.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Assuming historians are correct in identifying the two rulers, we are looking at the four people intensely involved in the production of this manuscript. As patron and ruler, Queen Blanche of Castile would have financed its production. As ruler-to-be, Louis IX&rsquo;s job was to take its lessons to heart along with those from the other biblical and ancient texts that his tutors read with him. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>King and queen&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the upper register, an enthroned king and queen wear the traditional medieval open crown topped with fleur-de-lys&mdash;a stylized iris or lily symbolizing a French monarch&rsquo;s religious, political, and dynastic right to rule. The blue-eyed queen, left, is veiled in a white widow&rsquo;s wimple. An ermine-lined blue mantle drapes over her shoulders. Her pink T-shaped tunic spills over a thin blue edge of paint which visually supports these enthroned figures. A slender green column divides the queen&rsquo;s space from that of her son, King Louis IX, to whom she deliberately gestures across the page, raising her left hand in his direction. Her pose and animated facial expression suggest that she is dedicating this manuscript, with its lessons and morals, to the young king.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Detail of Louis IX, Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France; Author Dictating to a Scribe, Moralized Bible, c. 1230\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ee963dae254d56733ad615fbcde5ea72e91d098e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Detail of Louis IX,<em> Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France; Author Dictating to a Scribe, Moralized Bible</em>, c. 1230</span></span>Louis IX, a trefoiled open crown atop his head, returns his mother&rsquo;s glance. In his right hand he holds a scepter, indicating his kingly status. It is topped by the characteristic fleur-de-lys on which, curiously, a bird sits. A four-pedaled brooch, dominated by a large square of sapphire blue in the center, secures a pink mantle lined with green that rests on his boyish shoulders.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his left hand, between his forefinger and thumb, Louis holds a small golden ball or disc. During the mass that followed coronations, French kings and queens would traditionally give the presiding bishop of Reims 13 gold coins (all French kings were crowned in this northern French cathedral town.) This could reference Louis&rsquo; 1226 coronation, just three weeks after his father&rsquo;s death, suggesting a probable date for this bible&rsquo;s commission. A manuscript this lavish, however, would have taken eight to ten years to complete&mdash;perfect timing, because in 1235, the 21-year-old Louis was ready to assume the rule of his Capetian kingdom from his mother.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A link between earth and heaven</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Coronation of the Virgin, tympanum of central portal, north transept, Chartres Cathedral, c. 1204-10\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6faa2e8422040038119b3e8122aea184fcbba3b4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coronation of the Virgin, tympanum of central portal, north transept, Chartres Cathedral, c. 1204-10</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Queen Blanche and her son, the young king, echo a gesture and pose that would have been familiar to many Christians: the Virgin Mary and Christ enthroned side-by-side as celestial rulers of heaven, found in the numerous Coronations of the Virgin carved in ivory, wood, and stone. This scene was especially prevalent in tympana, the top sculpted semi-circle over cathedral portals found throughout France. On beholding the Morgan illumination, viewers would have immediately made the connection between this earthly Queen Blanche and her son, anointed by God with the divine right to rule, and that of Mary, Queen of heaven and her son, divine figures who offer salvation.</p>\n"

"<h3>A cleric and an artist</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France; Author Dictating to a Scribe, Moralized Bible, c. 1230 (detail) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/165766a2a26a3f8abd82e8307974c4c9aa6e4a8e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France; Author Dictating to a Scribe</em>, Moralized Bible, c. 1230 (detail) </span></span>The illumination&rsquo;s bottom register depicts a tonsured cleric (churchman with a partly shaved head), left, and an illuminator, right.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The cleric wears a sleeveless cloak appropriate for divine services&mdash;this is an educated man&mdash;and emphasizes his role as a scholar. He tilts his head forward and points his right forefinger at the artist across from him, as though giving instructions. No clues are given as to this cleric&rsquo;s religious order, as he probably represents the many Parisian theologians responsible for the manuscript&rsquo;s visual and literary content&mdash;all of whom were undoubtedly told to spare no expense.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On the right, the artist, donning a blue surcoat and wearing a cap, is seated on cushioned bench.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France; Author Dictating to a Scribe, Moralized Bible, c. 1230 (detail) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1afe70968a397d753037c385c78b77187c13e92e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Blanche of Castile and King Louis IX of France; Author Dictating to a Scribe, Moralized Bible, c. 1230 (detail) </span></span><span>Knife in his left hand and stylus in his right, he looks down at his work: four vertically-stacked circles in a left column, with part of a fifth visible on the right. We know, from the 4887 medallions that precede this illumination, what&rsquo;s next on this artist&rsquo;s agenda: he will apply a thin sheet of gold leaf onto the background, and then paint the medallion&#39;s biblical and explanatory scenes in brilliant hues of lapis lazuli, green, red, yellow, grey, orange and sepia.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Advice for a king</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Blanche undoubtedly hand-picked the theologians whose job it was to establish this manuscript&rsquo;s guidelines, select biblical passages, write explanations, hire copyists, and oversee the images that the artists should paint. Art and text, mutually dependent, spelled out advice that its readers, Louis IX and perhaps his siblings, could practice in their enlightened rule. The nobles, church officials, and perhaps even common folk who viewed this page could be reassured that their ruler had been well trained to deal with whatever calamities came his way.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This 13th century illumination, both dazzling and edifying, represents the cutting edge of lavishness in a society that embraced conspicuous consumption. As a pedagogical tool, perhaps it played no small part in helping Louis IX achieve the status of sainthood, awarded by Pope Bonifiace VIII 27 years after the king&rsquo;s death. This and other images in the bible moralis&eacute;e explain why Parisian illuminators monopolized manuscript production at this time. Look again at the work. Who else could compete against such a resounding image of character and grace?&nbsp;</p>\n"

With her arms bent and pulled up against her sides as if to strike, she is truly an imposing sight.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Numerous snakes&nbsp;appear to writhe across the sculpture&rsquo;s surface. In fact, snakes form her entire skirt, as well as her belt and even her head. Coatlicue&rsquo;s name literally means Snakes-Her-Skirt, so her clothing helps&nbsp;identify her. Her snake belt ties at the waist to&nbsp;keep a skull &ldquo;buckle&rdquo; in place. Her upper torso is exposed, and we can just make out her breasts and rolls in her abdomen. The rolls indicate she is a mother. A sizable necklace formed of hands and hearts largely obscures her breasts.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two enormous snakes curl upwards from her neck to face one another. Their bifurcated, or split, tongues curl downwards, and the resulting effect is that the snake heads and tongues appear to be a single, forward-facing serpent face. Snakes coming out of body parts,&nbsp;as we see here, was an Aztec convention for squirting blood. Coatlicue has in fact been decapitated, and her snaky head represents the blood squirting from her severed neck. Her arms are also formed of snake heads, suggesting she was&nbsp;dismembered there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>You might read elsewhere that Coatlicue was decapitated by her daughter or beheaded when her son was born from her severed neck (the idea has been adopted in part to explain this&nbsp;monumental sculpture). However, the myth from which this story derives does not actually state that Coatlicue suffered this fate. For this reason, it is useful to review the myth&mdash;one of the most important for the Aztecs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Battle atop Snake Mountain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The primary myth in which Coatlicue is involved recounts the birth of the Aztec patron deity, Huitzilopochtli (pronounced &quot;wheat-zil-oh-poach-lee&quot;). This myth was recorded in the later sixteenth century after the Spanish Conquest of 1521.&nbsp;The main source from which we learn about it is the <em>General History of the Things of New Spain</em>, also called <em>The Florentine Codex </em>(written 1575&ndash;77 and compiled by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, indigenous authors and artists, and indigenous informants).[1]</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahagún, General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex), 1575–77, volume 1, page 420\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cc0858043f003a3d842f1cc2cb564a95483151c7.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, <em>General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex)</em>, 1575&ndash;77, volume 1, page 420</span></span>One day Coatlicue, an earth goddess, was sweeping atop Coatepec (or Snake Mountain), when a feather fell into her apron. At that moment, she immaculately conceived a son, whose name was Huitzilopochtli (a sun and warrior god). Upon hearing that her mother was pregnant, Coyolxauhqui (or Bells-Her-Cheeks, pronounced &quot;coy-al-shauw-kee&quot;) became enraged. She rallied her 400 brothers, the <em>Centzonhuitz-nahua,</em>&nbsp;to storm Snake Mountain and kill their mother. One of the brothers decided to warn Coatlicue. Upon hearing of this impending murder, Coatlicue became understandably afraid. But Huitzilopochtli comforted her, telling her not to worry. At the moment Coyolxauhqui approached her mother, Huitzilopochtli was born, fully grown and armed. He sliced off his sister&rsquo;s head, and threw her body off the mountain. As she fell, her body broke apart until it came to rest&nbsp;at the bottom of Snake Mountain. But what became of Coatlicue, the mother to the victorious Huitzilopochtli and the defeated Coyolxauhqui? The myth does not mention her decapitation and dismemberment (only her daughter&rsquo;s), so why would this&nbsp;famous&nbsp;sculpture display her in this manner?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why was Coatlicue decapitated?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More recently, a new interpretation has been offered for Coatlicue&rsquo;s appearance that is based on another myth (recounted in different Spanish Colonial source) concerning the beginning of 5th era, or 5th sun.The Aztecs believed that there were four earlier suns (or eras) prior to the one in which we currently live. The myth notes that several female deities (perhaps Coatlicue among them), sacrificed themselves to put the sun in motion, effectively allowing time itself to continue. They were responsible for preserving the cosmos by offering their own lives.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt,  257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7245a7e2066f010d3debbb789296c8c86049d06d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt, 257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After this point, these female deities were then symbolized by their skirts (called <em>mantas</em>), which could explain the careful attention paid to Coatlicue&rsquo;s snaky skirt. It functions as a reminder of her name&mdash;Snakes-Her-Skirt&mdash;as well as symbolizing&nbsp;her as a deity and&nbsp;reminding the viewer&nbsp;of her past deeds. This might also explain why&mdash;in place of her head&mdash;we have two snakes rising from her severed neck.&nbsp;They represent streaming blood, which was a precious liquid connoting fertility. With her willing sacrifice, Coatlicue enabled life to continue.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some details on the sculpture support this newer and enticing interpretation. There is a date glyph, 12 Reed, inscribed on the sculpture&rsquo;s back which might relate to the beginning of a new solar era. Archaeologists have also found the remains of several other monumental sculptures of female deities similar to Coatlicue, but each display different skirts. One of these sculptures (see photo at top of the page) stands near to Coatlicue in the Anthropology Museum, but hearts adorn her skirt instead of snakes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Coatlicue de Cozcatlán, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8f7c8d37b4ea61b5e1720fae09c36a7f8792f7ca.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coatlicue de Cozcatl&aacute;n, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span>Despite her fame in one of the most important Aztec myths concerning their patron god, Coatlicue did not have numerous stories recorded about her during the sixteenth century (that we know of at least). Few surviving Aztec objects display her. However, another stone sculpture in the National Museum of Anthropology&mdash;on a much smaller scale&mdash;shows Coatlicue with her head intact. We can identify her by her snaky skirt. Her face is partly skeletonized and de-fleshed. Her nose is missing, revealing the cavity. Yet she still has flesh on her lips, which are open to reveal bared teeth. Even with her head, this version of Coatlicue still seems intimidating to us today. But was she perceived as terrifying by the Aztecs or is this only a twenty-first century impression of her?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Terrifying and Respected</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Prior to the Spanish Conquest, Coatlicue related to other female earth deities, such as Toci (Our Grandmother). Several sixteenth-century Spanish Colonial sources&nbsp;mention that Coatlicue belonged to a class of deities known as <em>tzitzimime</em> (deities related to the stars), who were considered terrifying and dangerous. For example, outside of the 360-days that formed the agricultural calendar (called the year count or <em>xiuhpohualli</em>), there were five&nbsp;extra &ldquo;nameless&rdquo; days. The Aztecs believed this&nbsp;was an ominous time when bad things could happen. The <em>tzitzimime</em>, for instance, could descend to the earth&rsquo;s surface and eat people or at least wreak havoc, causing instability and fear. In Spanish Colonial chronicles, the <em>tzitzimime</em> are depicted with skeletonized faces and monster claws&mdash;similar to what we see in Coatlicue sculptures discussed here. These sources also call the <em>tzitzimime</em> demons or devils.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For all their ferociousness, however, the <em>tzitzimime</em>&nbsp;also had&nbsp;positive associations. Ironically,&nbsp;this&nbsp;group of deities were patrons of midwives, or women responsible for helping mothers with their babies. People also invoked them for medical help&nbsp;and they&nbsp;had associations with fertility. For these reasons, they had a more ambivalent role than as simply good or bad deities, and so they were both respected and feared.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Created, Buried, Found, Buried, Found Again</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After the Spanish Conquest, the monumental Coatlicue sculpture was buried because it was considered an inappropriate pagan idol by Spanish Christian invaders. After languishing in obscurity for more than 200 years, it was rediscovered in 1790.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Image published in Antonio León y Gama’s 1792 book\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e9b4611b1c5fe97af8c337d668e4a4ad36d613de.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Image published in Antonio Le&oacute;n y Gama&rsquo;s 1792 book,&nbsp;<em>Descripci&oacute;n hist&oacute;rica y cronol&oacute;gica de las dos piedras que con ocasi&oacute;n del nuevo empedrado que se est&aacute; formando en la plaza principal de M&eacute;xico, se hallaron en ella el a&ntilde;o de 1790</em></span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Antonio Le&oacute;n y Gama, a curious historian, astronomer, and intellectual living in Mexico City at the time, drew illustrations of the sculpture and offered his interpretation of who it displayed (he claimed it was Teoyaomiqui). Not long after it was found, however, Coatlicue was reburied&mdash;she was considered too frightening and pagan. Eventually, she was uncovered again in the twentieth century, becoming one of the crowning objects of the National Anthropology Museum and a famous representative of Aztec artistic achievements in stone sculpture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>[1]&nbsp;There are several other myths that make mention of Coatlicue, but the most frequently cited myth is the one in the Florentine Codex discussed in the text.</p>\n"

Their bifurcated, or split, tongues curl downwards, and the resulting effect is that the snake heads and tongues appear to be a single, forward-facing serpent face. Snakes coming out of body parts,&nbsp;as we see here, was an Aztec convention for squirting blood. Coatlicue has in fact been decapitated, and her snaky head represents the blood squirting from her severed neck. Her arms are also formed of snake heads, suggesting she was&nbsp;dismembered there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>You might read elsewhere that Coatlicue was decapitated by her daughter or beheaded when her son was born from her severed neck (the idea has been adopted in part to explain this&nbsp;monumental sculpture). However, the myth from which this story derives does not actually state that Coatlicue suffered this fate. For this reason, it is useful to review the myth&mdash;one of the most important for the Aztecs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Battle atop Snake Mountain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The primary myth in which Coatlicue is involved recounts the birth of the Aztec patron deity, Huitzilopochtli (pronounced &quot;wheat-zil-oh-poach-lee&quot;). This myth was recorded in the later sixteenth century after the Spanish Conquest of 1521.&nbsp;The main source from which we learn about it is the <em>General History of the Things of New Spain</em>, also called <em>The Florentine Codex </em>(written 1575&ndash;77 and compiled by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, indigenous authors and artists, and indigenous informants).[1]</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahagún, General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex), 1575–77, volume 1, page 420\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cc0858043f003a3d842f1cc2cb564a95483151c7.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, <em>General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex)</em>, 1575&ndash;77, volume 1, page 420</span></span>One day Coatlicue, an earth goddess, was sweeping atop Coatepec (or Snake Mountain), when a feather fell into her apron. At that moment, she immaculately conceived a son, whose name was Huitzilopochtli (a sun and warrior god). Upon hearing that her mother was pregnant, Coyolxauhqui (or Bells-Her-Cheeks, pronounced &quot;coy-al-shauw-kee&quot;) became enraged. She rallied her 400 brothers, the <em>Centzonhuitz-nahua,</em>&nbsp;to storm Snake Mountain and kill their mother. One of the brothers decided to warn Coatlicue. Upon hearing of this impending murder, Coatlicue became understandably afraid. But Huitzilopochtli comforted her, telling her not to worry. At the moment Coyolxauhqui approached her mother, Huitzilopochtli was born, fully grown and armed. He sliced off his sister&rsquo;s head, and threw her body off the mountain. As she fell, her body broke apart until it came to rest&nbsp;at the bottom of Snake Mountain. But what became of Coatlicue, the mother to the victorious Huitzilopochtli and the defeated Coyolxauhqui? The myth does not mention her decapitation and dismemberment (only her daughter&rsquo;s), so why would this&nbsp;famous&nbsp;sculpture display her in this manner?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why was Coatlicue decapitated?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More recently, a new interpretation has been offered for Coatlicue&rsquo;s appearance that is based on another myth (recounted in different Spanish Colonial source) concerning the beginning of 5th era, or 5th sun.The Aztecs believed that there were four earlier suns (or eras) prior to the one in which we currently live. The myth notes that several female deities (perhaps Coatlicue among them), sacrificed themselves to put the sun in motion, effectively allowing time itself to continue. They were responsible for preserving the cosmos by offering their own lives.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>After this point, these female deities were then symbolized by their skirts (called <em>mantas</em>), which could explain the careful attention paid to Coatlicue&rsquo;s snaky skirt. It functions as a reminder of her name&mdash;Snakes-Her-Skirt&mdash;as well as symbolizing&nbsp;her as a deity and&nbsp;reminding the viewer&nbsp;of her past deeds. This might also explain why&mdash;in place of her head&mdash;we have two snakes rising from her severed neck.&nbsp;They represent streaming blood, which was a precious liquid connoting fertility. With her willing sacrifice, Coatlicue enabled life to continue.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some details on the sculpture support this newer and enticing interpretation. There is a date glyph, 12 Reed, inscribed on the sculpture&rsquo;s back which might relate to the beginning of a new solar era. Archaeologists have also found the remains of several other monumental sculptures of female deities similar to Coatlicue, but each display different skirts. One of these sculptures (see photo at top of the page) stands near to Coatlicue in the Anthropology Museum, but hearts adorn her skirt instead of snakes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Coatlicue de Cozcatlán, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8f7c8d37b4ea61b5e1720fae09c36a7f8792f7ca.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coatlicue de Cozcatl&aacute;n, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span>Despite her fame in one of the most important Aztec myths concerning their patron god, Coatlicue did not have numerous stories recorded about her during the sixteenth century (that we know of at least). Few surviving Aztec objects display her. However, another stone sculpture in the National Museum of Anthropology&mdash;on a much smaller scale&mdash;shows Coatlicue with her head intact. We can identify her by her snaky skirt. Her face is partly skeletonized and de-fleshed. Her nose is missing, revealing the cavity. Yet she still has flesh on her lips, which are open to reveal bared teeth. Even with her head, this version of Coatlicue still seems intimidating to us today. But was she perceived as terrifying by the Aztecs or is this only a twenty-first century impression of her?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Terrifying and Respected</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Prior to the Spanish Conquest, Coatlicue related to other female earth deities, such as Toci (Our Grandmother). Several sixteenth-century Spanish Colonial sources&nbsp;mention that Coatlicue belonged to a class of deities known as <em>tzitzimime</em> (deities related to the stars), who were considered terrifying and dangerous. For example, outside of the 360-days that formed the agricultural calendar (called the year count or <em>xiuhpohualli</em>), there were five&nbsp;extra &ldquo;nameless&rdquo; days. The Aztecs believed this&nbsp;was an ominous time when bad things could happen. The <em>tzitzimime</em>, for instance, could descend to the earth&rsquo;s surface and eat people or at least wreak havoc, causing instability and fear. In Spanish Colonial chronicles, the <em>tzitzimime</em> are depicted with skeletonized faces and monster claws&mdash;similar to what we see in Coatlicue sculptures discussed here. These sources also call the <em>tzitzimime</em> demons or devils.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For all their ferociousness, however, the <em>tzitzimime</em>&nbsp;also had&nbsp;positive associations. Ironically,&nbsp;this&nbsp;group of deities were patrons of midwives, or women responsible for helping mothers with their babies. People also invoked them for medical help&nbsp;and they&nbsp;had associations with fertility. For these reasons, they had a more ambivalent role than as simply good or bad deities, and so they were both respected and feared.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Created, Buried, Found, Buried, Found Again</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After the Spanish Conquest, the monumental Coatlicue sculpture was buried because it was considered an inappropriate pagan idol by Spanish Christian invaders. After languishing in obscurity for more than 200 years, it was rediscovered in 1790.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Image published in Antonio León y Gama’s 1792 book\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e9b4611b1c5fe97af8c337d668e4a4ad36d613de.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Image published in Antonio Le&oacute;n y Gama&rsquo;s 1792 book,&nbsp;<em>Descripci&oacute;n hist&oacute;rica y cronol&oacute;gica de las dos piedras que con ocasi&oacute;n del nuevo empedrado que se est&aacute; formando en la plaza principal de M&eacute;xico, se hallaron en ella el a&ntilde;o de 1790</em></span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Antonio Le&oacute;n y Gama, a curious historian, astronomer, and intellectual living in Mexico City at the time, drew illustrations of the sculpture and offered his interpretation of who it displayed (he claimed it was Teoyaomiqui). Not long after it was found, however, Coatlicue was reburied&mdash;she was considered too frightening and pagan. Eventually, she was uncovered again in the twentieth century, becoming one of the crowning objects of the National Anthropology Museum and a famous representative of Aztec artistic achievements in stone sculpture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>[1]&nbsp;There are several other myths that make mention of Coatlicue, but the most frequently cited myth is the one in the Florentine Codex discussed in the text.</p>\n"

"<h3>Parchment&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For much of the Middle Ages dead cows were the main ingredient for books. What was frolicking in the meadow one month, may have been a page in a Bible the next. The skin of animals (calves, goats, sheep)&nbsp;was turned into parchment, which was subsequently cut into sheets.

"\n"
"<p>There is a lot you can tell from medieval skin. Like a physician today, the book historian can make a diagnosis by observing it carefully.

"<p>Preparing parchment was a delicate business. In order to clear the skin of flesh and hair, it was attached to a wooden frame, tight like a drum.

"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Another skin problem encountered by scribes during a book&rsquo;s production was the animal&rsquo;s hair follicle&mdash;the skin organ that produces hair (seen above). These follicles show as pronounced black dots on the white page. Often parchment makers or scribes were able to sand them away, producing the desired smooth and cream-colored surface. However, if the follicles had been too deep in a calf or sheep, no dermatologist could have removed the imperfection, let alone the blunt instruments of the scribe. The only thing to do was to write around the patch. The follicles are helpful because they allow us to determine&mdash; from the distance between them&mdash;whether the animal was a calf, a sheep or a goat. This, in turn, may shed light on where the manuscript was produced: the use of goat, for example, often points to Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The transition to paper</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 12th century another material appeared in Europe: paper. Imported from Arabic culture, it was first exclusively used for documentary purposes, such as account books and letters. In a remarkable shift of scribal practices, in the fourteenth century scribes all over Europe started to use paper for manuscripts. Conservative scribes, such as monks, ignored the new material for some time, while others&mdash;especially those who wanted to economize&mdash;embraced it. Paper and parchment were used for all sorts of manuscripts, from chunky volumes to small portable&nbsp;books.</p>\n"

"<p>Another skin problem encountered by scribes during a book&rsquo;s production was the animal&rsquo;s hair follicle&mdash;the skin organ that produces hair (seen above). These follicles show as pronounced black dots on the white page. Often parchment makers or scribes were able to sand them away, producing the desired smooth and cream-colored surface. However, if the follicles had been too deep in a calf or sheep, no dermatologist could have removed the imperfection, let alone the blunt instruments of the scribe. The only thing to do was to write around the patch. The follicles are helpful because they allow us to determine&mdash; from the distance between them&mdash;whether the animal was a calf, a sheep or a goat. This, in turn, may shed light on where the manuscript was produced: the use of goat, for example, often points to Italy.</p>\n"

In a remarkable shift of scribal practices, in the fourteenth century scribes all over Europe started to use paper for manuscripts. Conservative scribes, such as monks, ignored the new material for some time, while others&mdash;especially those who wanted to economize&mdash;embraced it. Paper and parchment were used for all sorts of manuscripts, from chunky volumes to small portable&nbsp;books.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>A new city</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Seventh-century North Africa was not the easiest place to establish a new city. It required battling Byzantines; convincing Berbers, the indigenous people of North Africa, to accept centralized Muslim rule; and persuading Middle Eastern merchants to move to North Africa. So, in 670 CE, conquering general Sidi Okba constructed a Friday Mosque (<em>masjid-i jami`</em>&nbsp;or<em>&nbsp;jami`</em>) in what was becoming Kairouan in modern day Tunisia. A Friday Mosque is used for communal prayers on the Muslim holy day, Friday. The mosque was a critical addition, communicating that Kairouan would become a cosmopolitan metropolis under strong Muslim control, an important distinction at this time and place.</p>\n"

"<p>During the eighth century, Sidi Okba&rsquo;s mosque was rebuilt at least twice as Kairouan prospered. However, the mosque we see today is essentially ninth century. The Aghlabids (800-909 C.E.) were the semi-independent rulers of much of North Africa. In 836, Prince Ziyadat Allah I tore down most of the earlier mudbrick structure and rebuilt it in more permanent stone, brick, and wood. The prayer hall or sanctuary is supported by rows of columns and there is an open courtyard, that are characteristic of a hypostyle plan.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The drum rests on squinches, small arches decorated with shell over rosette designs similar to examples in Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad Islamic art. The stone dome is constructed of twenty four ribs that each have a small corbel at their base, so the dome looks like a cut cantaloupe, according to the architectural historian K. A. C.

"<p><span>Other architectural elements link the Great Mosque of Kairouan with earlier and contemporary Islamic religious structures and pre-Islamic buildings. They also show the joint religious and secular importance of the Great Mosque of Kairouan. Like other hypostyle mosques, such as the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque in Medina, the mosque of Kairouan is roughly rectangular. Wider aisles leading to the mihrab and along the qibla wall give it a T-plan. The sanctuary roof and courtyard porticos are supported by repurposed Roman and Byzantine columns and capitals.</span></p>\n"

"<p>Since it was used for Friday prayer, the mosque has a ninth-century minbar, a narrow wooden pulpit where the weekly sermon was delivered. It is said to be the oldest surviving wooden minbar. Like Christian pulpits, the minbar made the prayer leader more visible and audible. Because a ruler&rsquo;s legitimacy could rest upon the mention of his name during the sermon, the minbar served both religious and secular purposes. The minbar is made from teak imported from Asia, an expensive material exemplifying Kairouan&rsquo;s commercial reach. The side of the minbar closest to the mihrab is composed of elaborately carved latticework with vegetal, floral, and geometric designs evocative of those used in Byzantine and Umayyad architecture.</p>\n"

Perhaps inspired by Roman lighthouses, the massive square Kairouan minaret is about thirty two meters tall, over one hundred feet, making it one of the highest structures around. So in addition to functioning as a place to call for prayer, the minaret identifies the mosque&rsquo;s presence and location in the city while helping to define the city&rsquo;s religious identity. As it was placed just off the mihrab axis, it also affirmed the mihrab&rsquo;s importance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mosque continued to be modified after the Aghlabids, showing that it remained religiously and socially significant even as Kairouan fell into decline. A Zirid, al-Mu&lsquo;izz ibn Badis (ruled 1016-62 CE), commissioned a wooden maqsura, an enclosed space within a mosque that was reserved for the ruler and his associates. The maqsura is assembled from cutwork wooden screens topped with bands of carved abstracted vegetal motifs set into geometric frames, kufic-style script inscriptions, and merlons, which look like the crenellations a top a fortress wall. Maqsuras are said to indicate political instability in a society. They remove a ruler from the rest of the worshippers. So, the enclosure, along with its inscription, protected the lives and affirmed the status of persons allowed inside.</p>\n"

In 1294, Caliph al-Mustansir restored the courtyard and added monumental portals, such as Bab al-Ma on the east and the domed Bab Lalla Rejana on the west. Additional gates were constructed in later centuries.

"<h3>An intellectual center</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Great Mosque was literally and figuratively at the center of Kairouan activity, growth, and prestige. Though the mosque is now near the northwest city ramparts established in the eleventh century, when Sidi Okba founded Kairouan, it was probably closer to the center of town, near what was the governor&rsquo;s residence and the main thoroughfare, a symbolically prominent and physical visible part of the city. By the mid-tenth century, Kairouan became a thriving settlement with marketplaces, agriculture imported from surrounding towns, cisterns supplying water, and textile and ceramic manufacturing areas. It was a political capital, a pilgrimage city, and intellectual center, particularly for the Maliki school of Sunni Islam and the sciences. The Great Mosque had fifteen thoroughfares leading from it into a city that may have had a circular layout like Baghdad, the capital of the Islamic empire during Kairouan&rsquo;s heyday. As a Friday Mosque, it was one of if not the largest buildings in town.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Even today, the Great Mosque of Kairouan reflects the time and place in which it was built.</p>\n"

The stone dome is constructed of twenty four ribs that each have a small corbel at their base, so the dome looks like a cut cantaloupe, according to the architectural historian K. A. C.

"<p>Since it was used for Friday prayer, the mosque has a ninth-century minbar, a narrow wooden pulpit where the weekly sermon was delivered. It is said to be the oldest surviving wooden minbar. Like Christian pulpits, the minbar made the prayer leader more visible and audible. Because a ruler&rsquo;s legitimacy could rest upon the mention of his name during the sermon, the minbar served both religious and secular purposes. The minbar is made from teak imported from Asia, an expensive material exemplifying Kairouan&rsquo;s commercial reach. The side of the minbar closest to the mihrab is composed of elaborately carved latticework with vegetal, floral, and geometric designs evocative of those used in Byzantine and Umayyad architecture.</p>\n"

Perhaps inspired by Roman lighthouses, the massive square Kairouan minaret is about thirty two meters tall, over one hundred feet, making it one of the highest structures around. So in addition to functioning as a place to call for prayer, the minaret identifies the mosque&rsquo;s presence and location in the city while helping to define the city&rsquo;s religious identity. As it was placed just off the mihrab axis, it also affirmed the mihrab&rsquo;s importance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mosque continued to be modified after the Aghlabids, showing that it remained religiously and socially significant even as Kairouan fell into decline. A Zirid, al-Mu&lsquo;izz ibn Badis (ruled 1016-62 CE), commissioned a wooden maqsura, an enclosed space within a mosque that was reserved for the ruler and his associates. The maqsura is assembled from cutwork wooden screens topped with bands of carved abstracted vegetal motifs set into geometric frames, kufic-style script inscriptions, and merlons, which look like the crenellations a top a fortress wall. Maqsuras are said to indicate political instability in a society. They remove a ruler from the rest of the worshippers. So, the enclosure, along with its inscription, protected the lives and affirmed the status of persons allowed inside.</p>\n"

Additional gates were constructed in later centuries.

"<h3>An intellectual center</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Great Mosque was literally and figuratively at the center of Kairouan activity, growth, and prestige. Though the mosque is now near the northwest city ramparts established in the eleventh century, when Sidi Okba founded Kairouan, it was probably closer to the center of town, near what was the governor&rsquo;s residence and the main thoroughfare, a symbolically prominent and physical visible part of the city. By the mid-tenth century, Kairouan became a thriving settlement with marketplaces, agriculture imported from surrounding towns, cisterns supplying water, and textile and ceramic manufacturing areas. It was a political capital, a pilgrimage city, and intellectual center, particularly for the Maliki school of Sunni Islam and the sciences. The Great Mosque had fifteen thoroughfares leading from it into a city that may have had a circular layout like Baghdad, the capital of the Islamic empire during Kairouan&rsquo;s heyday. As a Friday Mosque, it was one of if not the largest buildings in town.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Even today, the Great Mosque of Kairouan reflects the time and place in which it was built.</p>\n"

"<p>We are used to having multiple books open at the same time when looking things up at home or writing an essay for class. Whether PDFs, e-books or good-old-fashioned paper volumes, switching between books in a smooth movement is something we don&rsquo;t often think about. This was very different in medieval times. In those days, books tended to resist when you tried to move them: they were as heavy as a brick and easily twice that size. A related problem was one of space. The average medieval book has a wingspan of at least half a meter wide when open. Consequently, comfortably placing two books in front of you was a stretch, let alone multiple volumes. In an early-sixteenth-century depiction of Erasmus, the scholar cannot even place a single book on his desk as he is writing a letter (above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Interestingly, the challenges of medieval book consultation stands in stark contrast with what we know about reading and studying in the period. We know that readers were&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in learning different points of view with respect to their topic of inquiry, and so&nbsp;browsed through a great number of volumes at the same time. Sparked by this contradiction, this article explores medieval desktops. How many books are being consulted at the same time in medieval depictions of reading? How are the objects laid out across the available space? In short, how are we to understand the logistics behind the devouring of knowledge in the last four centuries of the Middle Ages? As will become clear, the answers to these questions vary greatly depending on why an individual handled multiple books at the same time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Scribes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first group of individuals who had to manage multiple books were scribes. By definition, a scribe had to have at least two books on his desk: the one he was making (a growing pile of quires, which remained unbound until the very end) and the one he was copying from (called the &ldquo;exemplar&rdquo;). While keeping track of the loose quires may have been challenging, of the groups discussed here scribes had it the easiest. After all, the individual was only technically reading one book&mdash;the one he was copying from. This explains why their deskspace was of limited size, at least judging from surviving depictions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Buonaccorso of Pistoia, of true nobility Debate, Jean Le Tavernier, illuminator, Jean Miélot in his study, after 1450, Brussels, KBR, ms. 9278-80 f. 10\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b899b9fbb99460fd47bbe8e20e0d342194a2aba5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Jean Le Tavernier (illuminator), Jean Mi&eacute;lot in his study, after 1450, Buonaccorso of Pistoia,&nbsp;Brussels, Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, MS 9278-80, fol. 10r</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In most cases their working space was erect rather than flat. The&nbsp;famous image of Jean Mi&eacute;lot at work (above) shows how the desktop of the scribe had a 45-degree angle, resulting in an almost erect surface. Clearly visible is also a vertical orientation in the line-up of the books: one was placed above the other. In fact, the desktop in this image is split in half, with the lower half containing the book under production, as well as the scribe&rsquo;s tools (ink pots and pens), while the upper half holds the exemplar. Mi&eacute;lot obviously needed to go shopping for a larger desk, because we see books laying around on the ground and on a bench.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Miniature of the translator, Simon de Hesdin, at work in his study, Valerius Maximus, translated by Simon de Hesdin and Nicholas de Gonesse, Facta et dicta memorabilia, 1479, London, British Library, Royal 18 E III, f. 24 \n"

Although the books are out of sight, the desk clearly provides room for two books. However, they placed next to one another. This may be specially done for the task of a translator, who needed to carefully read the source text and subsequently scribbling down the translation in loose quires or on loose sheets. This way, both books would be right before him: there was no need to look up at a high book platform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Readers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is easy to find images of scribes with a desk full of books, it is less common to encounter readers in similar situations. That is to say: there are very few medieval scenes in which someone is reading but not writing&mdash;where books are present but pens are not. In part, this has to do with medieval study practices. Readers would usually have a pen nearby even when they were just reading. After all, remarks and critiques needed to be added to the margin at the spur of the moment. &ldquo;Penless&rdquo; images, while rare, often show a crowded desktop. The image&nbsp;below&nbsp;shows Christine de Pisan (a late medieval author) browsing multiple books at a big desk.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Brussels, Bibliothèque, Royale, MS 9009-11\n"

"\n"
"<p>The absence of the pen may result from an urge to depict Christine as an avid reader. This is emphasized, I think, by the various volumes that lay open&mdash;note how some open books are facing down, the way we still do today! From the late medieval period a special tool was available for readers who did not like the clutter shown on Christine&rsquo;s desk: the book carousel.</p>\n"
"\n"

"<p>These carousels allowed readers to consult multiple manuscripts in a very convenient fashion, by spinning (slowly!) the top part, which moved.

The answer to this question is perhaps one of the most intriguing pieces of book furniture that survive from the past: the book wheel.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The image at left&nbsp;shows the book wheel invented by the Renaissance engineer Agostino Ramelli, whose concept was based on medieval designs. The upside to the carousel is obvious: there was space for a lot of books. This practice is not unlike deciding to hook up a second monitor to your computer, except that the individual is actually watching twelve monitors at the same time&mdash;like a trader on Wall Street. I have sat behind one from the 17th century myself and it is truly a majestic feeling to spin the wheel. The click-click sound of the gears hidden inside the device is simply mesmerizing.</p>\n"

They were used, for example, by noblemen or secretaries drafting documents and letters while&nbsp;on the road.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The portable desktop was generally&nbsp;a box with a slightly angled surface, inside which the writing materials were stored, including sheets, ink and pens. Interestingly, this practice&mdash;and tool&mdash;goes back to at least the twelfth century (see image, left). The device contained&nbsp;a hole for the ink pot and inside may well have been blank sheets&mdash;in parallel to the portable kits from the Renaissance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Apart from the fact that the actual desk space was more limited than what we are used to, the medieval desktop was not so different from ours, including how messy it was. They contained books, both open and closed, as well as writing tools. However, more so than in our present time, desktops were a necessary tool, whether they were packed (as in Christine&rsquo;s case) or with only one or two books in place (as with most scribes). The medieval quill, after all, needed a stable and even surface. While desktops may seem trivial objects to us, they were crucially important to both medieval scribes and readers.</p>\n"

"<p>We are used to having multiple books open at the same time when looking things up at home or writing an essay for class. Whether PDFs, e-books or good-old-fashioned paper volumes, switching between books in a smooth movement is something we don&rsquo;t often think about. This was very different in medieval times. In those days, books tended to resist when you tried to move them: they were as heavy as a brick and easily twice that size. A related problem was one of space. The average medieval book has a wingspan of at least half a meter wide when open. Consequently, comfortably placing two books in front of you was a stretch, let alone multiple volumes. In an early-sixteenth-century depiction of Erasmus, the scholar cannot even place a single book on his desk as he is writing a letter (above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Interestingly, the challenges of medieval book consultation stands in stark contrast with what we know about reading and studying in the period. We know that readers were&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in learning different points of view with respect to their topic of inquiry, and so&nbsp;browsed through a great number of volumes at the same time. Sparked by this contradiction, this article explores medieval desktops. How many books are being consulted at the same time in medieval depictions of reading? How are the objects laid out across the available space? In short, how are we to understand the logistics behind the devouring of knowledge in the last four centuries of the Middle Ages? As will become clear, the answers to these questions vary greatly depending on why an individual handled multiple books at the same time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Scribes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first group of individuals who had to manage multiple books were scribes. By definition, a scribe had to have at least two books on his desk: the one he was making (a growing pile of quires, which remained unbound until the very end) and the one he was copying from (called the &ldquo;exemplar&rdquo;). While keeping track of the loose quires may have been challenging, of the groups discussed here scribes had it the easiest. After all, the individual was only technically reading one book&mdash;the one he was copying from. This explains why their deskspace was of limited size, at least judging from surviving depictions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Buonaccorso of Pistoia, of true nobility Debate, Jean Le Tavernier, illuminator, Jean Miélot in his study, after 1450, Brussels, KBR, ms. 9278-80 f. 10\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b899b9fbb99460fd47bbe8e20e0d342194a2aba5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Jean Le Tavernier (illuminator), Jean Mi&eacute;lot in his study, after 1450, Buonaccorso of Pistoia,&nbsp;Brussels, Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, MS 9278-80, fol. 10r</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In most cases their working space was erect rather than flat. The&nbsp;famous image of Jean Mi&eacute;lot at work (above) shows how the desktop of the scribe had a 45-degree angle, resulting in an almost erect surface. Clearly visible is also a vertical orientation in the line-up of the books: one was placed above the other. In fact, the desktop in this image is split in half, with the lower half containing the book under production, as well as the scribe&rsquo;s tools (ink pots and pens), while the upper half holds the exemplar. Mi&eacute;lot obviously needed to go shopping for a larger desk, because we see books laying around on the ground and on a bench.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\" \n"

III, fol. 24r</span></span>Interestingly, there are also desks with a horizontal orientation. The image at the left shows the translator Simon de Hesdin at work. Although the books are out of sight, the desk clearly provides room for two books. However, they placed next to one another. This may be specially done for the task of a translator, who needed to carefully read the source text and subsequently scribbling down the translation in loose quires or on loose sheets. This way, both books would be right before him: there was no need to look up at a high book platform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Readers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is easy to find images of scribes with a desk full of books, it is less common to encounter readers in similar situations. That is to say: there are very few medieval scenes in which someone is reading but not writing&mdash;where books are present but pens are not. In part, this has to do with medieval study practices. Readers would usually have a pen nearby even when they were just reading. After all, remarks and critiques needed to be added to the margin at the spur of the moment. &ldquo;Penless&rdquo; images, while rare, often show a crowded desktop. The image&nbsp;below&nbsp;shows Christine de Pisan (a late medieval author) browsing multiple books at a big desk.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Brussels, Bibliothèque, Royale, MS 9009-11\n"

"\n"
"<p>The absence of the pen may result from an urge to depict Christine as an avid reader. This is emphasized, I think, by the various volumes that lay open&mdash;note how some open books are facing down, the way we still do today! From the late medieval period a special tool was available for readers who did not like the clutter shown on Christine&rsquo;s desk: the book carousel.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Roman de la Rose, probably 2nd half of 15th century, Yale, Bodleian Library, MS Douce 195, f. 1r\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/06ed67ec21a9c89f9a3e5e6b14a1e80c3666bad1.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Roman de la Rose, probably 2nd half of 15th century, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Douce MS&nbsp;195, fol. 1r</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These carousels allowed readers to consult multiple manuscripts in a very convenient fashion, by spinning (slowly!) the top part, which moved. The oldest one I could find dates from the fourteenth century (<a href=\"http://erikkwakkel.tumblr.com/post/61664937976/medieval-book-gadget-this-image-shows-the-famous\">here</a>), but it is possible they were in use even earlier. It is striking that these two scenes (above and below)&nbsp;show readers&mdash;scholars&mdash;without pens, even though the second seems to hold an invisible one.</p>\n"

However, what if you need even more real estate than the turning desktop could offer? The answer to this question is perhaps one of the most intriguing pieces of book furniture that survive from the past: the book wheel.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The image at left&nbsp;shows the book wheel invented by the Renaissance engineer Agostino Ramelli, whose concept was based on medieval designs. The upside to the carousel is obvious: there was space for a lot of books. This practice is not unlike deciding to hook up a second monitor to your computer, except that the individual is actually watching twelve monitors at the same time&mdash;like a trader on Wall Street. I have sat behind one from the 17th century myself and it is truly a majestic feeling to spin the wheel. The click-click sound of the gears hidden inside the device is simply mesmerizing.</p>\n"

They were used, for example, by noblemen or secretaries drafting documents and letters while&nbsp;on the road.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The portable desktop was generally&nbsp;a box with a slightly angled surface, inside which the writing materials were stored, including sheets, ink and pens. Interestingly, this practice&mdash;and tool&mdash;goes back to at least the twelfth century (see image, left). The device contained&nbsp;a hole for the ink pot and inside may well have been blank sheets&mdash;in parallel to the portable kits from the Renaissance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Apart from the fact that the actual desk space was more limited than what we are used to, the medieval desktop was not so different from ours, including how messy it was. They contained books, both open and closed, as well as writing tools. However, more so than in our present time, desktops were a necessary tool, whether they were packed (as in Christine&rsquo;s case) or with only one or two books in place (as with most scribes). The medieval quill, after all, needed a stable and even surface. While desktops may seem trivial objects to us, they were crucially important to both medieval scribes and readers.</p>\n"

"<h3>Carpet weaving in the Islamic world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are woven works of art that were produced at every level of society in the Islamic world. Women have been weaving for centuries in villages and nomadic encampments all over the Middle East, Anatolia, and Central Asia, each woman passing down her techniques and designs to her daughters. These women created carpets both for sale and for their own personal use, and this tradition continues today.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Carpets were also made in the royal courts of the Islamic world. These carpets were not just functional floor coverings, they were ornate works of art that indicated the status and wealth of their owners. Court carpets were used on the floors in reception halls, audience chambers, and at court-supported religious institutions. They were also presented as impressive gifts to other rulers. Manuscript paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries suggest smaller rugs were often layered on top of larger carpets and also show that many carpets were used in outdoor pleasure pavilions and palatial parks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rulers had access to expensive materials, such as silk and metal-wrapped threads, and employed the most highly skilled designers and weavers in their empires to create enormous and luxurious carpets. Because of their quality, design, and skilled execution, court carpets are among the finest examples of art from the Islamic world. Court carpets are often very different from the carpets made in commercial workshops or villages. Rather than solely utilizing centuries-old traditional motifs, court carpets often share designs found on a range of media, such as bookbinding and manuscript painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although carpets were made in many royal courts, the Ottoman (1281&ndash;1924), the Safavid (1501&ndash;1732), and the Mughal (1526&ndash;1858) Empires provide some of the richest examples of royally produced carpets.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Ottoman Empire originated in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), and was one of the largest and longest lived in the Islamic world. It controlling territories that reached from North Africa to Eastern Europe from 1299 until 1923. Anatolia has a long tradition of carpet weaving, but from the 16th century onward Ottoman court carpets utilized a set of specific designs created by the artists of the Ottoman court workshops, designs that were also used on the court ceramics, paintings, bookbindings, and textiles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the most popular of these was the &ldquo;saz&nbsp;style,&rdquo; which is characterized by long sinuous leaves, and stylized flowers (see below). Court artists also developed the &ldquo;floral style,&rdquo; where we see more naturalistic depictions of flowers such as tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths, among others. The floral and&nbsp;saz&nbsp;styles were sometimes used alone and sometimes used together, along with other motifs like the cintamani pattern (usually a combination of pearl-like circles accompanied by wavy lines sometimes called &quot;tiger stripes&quot;), on a huge variety of objects designed by the court, including ceramics, silks, carpets, and manuscripts.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Both the&nbsp;saz&nbsp;and floral styles appear on this rare Ottoman court prayer rug. The jagged-edged&nbsp;saz&nbsp;leaves gracefully undulate in the border amongst carnations, tulips, and other flowers. The arch at the center of the carpet identifies this as a prayer rug, and symbolizes both amihrab&nbsp;(from mosque architecture) and a gateway to paradise. Such rugs were, and are, used by Muslims during the five daily prayers prescribed in Islam. Though one can go to mosque during the prayer times, prayer can take place anywhere so long as there is a clean surface (provided by the rug) and water for ritual cleansing. A luxurious prayer rug like this would have belonged to a very wealthy court patron.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of this remarkable carpet, the prototype for later designs, may be based on the slender-columned architecture of Muslim Spain. When Muslims and Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, many exiles settled in the Ottoman Empire, bringing with them their own visual culture, which, in turn, influenced Ottoman art. This dual-columned design spawned an entire genre of architecturally-inspired prayer rugs across Anatolia.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Ottoman court carpets is their unusual structure. Unlike all other Turkish carpets, Ottoman court carpets use S-spun wool, which is typical only of carpets woven in Egypt. Scholars attribute this unusual feature to the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, after which the Ottoman court commissioned carpets from Egyptian workshops and had Egyptian weavers and Egyptian wool sent to Turkey for their own use.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Contemporaneous manuscript illustrations shed light on how carpets were used at the court. Though we must remember that paintings are not photographs, and that artists may have invented much in their scenes, paintings like this can nevertheless tell us about the status of carpets in the court. In this painting, ordered by Sultan Murad III, a Safavid dignitary is presented to the Ottoman sultan against the backdrop of a magnificent red and blue Ushak medallion carpet. The painting shows how carpets were used as decorative and symbolic backdrops to Ottoman court rituals. Not only does the carpet provide a sumptuous setting for the ceremony, it also sends a message to the Safavids (political rivals of the Ottomans) about the wealth of the Ottoman court. We can imagine how such a carpet was used to demonstrate to visitors the power, culture, and artistic accomplishments of the Ottomans.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>Safavid court carpets</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Safavids ruled Greater Iran from the early 16th to the 18th century and were avid patrons of the arts. Safavid court carpets are noted for their detailed precision, sumptuous materials, and ornate designs.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Carpets intended for religious settings, like the Ardabil carpet, display non-figural decoration such as scrolling vines, flower motifs, calligraphy, and&nbsp;shamsas(sunbursts). Carpets made for secular settings, like the court&rsquo;s palaces and pleasure pavilions, display a wider range of motifs, encompassing the designs found on carpets like the Ardabil, but also sometimes including animals, hunting scenes, human figures, and even angels.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The carpet left is a remarkable example of a secular Safavid court carpet. It was woven entirely of silk, and its bright field is filled with animals&mdash;some real, like lions and rams, and others entirely fantastical. The animals, some of which are engaged in intense combat, are set amoungst a lush backdrop of stylized flowers and trees.

"<h3>Carpet weaving in the Islamic world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are woven works of art that were produced at every level of society in the Islamic world. Women have been weaving for centuries in villages and nomadic encampments all over the Middle East, Anatolia, and Central Asia, each woman passing down her techniques and designs to her daughters. These women created carpets both for sale and for their own personal use, and this tradition continues today.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Carpets were also made in the royal courts of the Islamic world. These carpets were not just functional floor coverings, they were ornate works of art that indicated the status and wealth of their owners. Court carpets were used on the floors in reception halls, audience chambers, and at court-supported religious institutions. They were also presented as impressive gifts to other rulers. Manuscript paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries suggest smaller rugs were often layered on top of larger carpets and also show that many carpets were used in outdoor pleasure pavilions and palatial parks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rulers had access to expensive materials, such as silk and metal-wrapped threads, and employed the most highly skilled designers and weavers in their empires to create enormous and luxurious carpets. Because of their quality, design, and skilled execution, court carpets are among the finest examples of art from the Islamic world. Court carpets are often very different from the carpets made in commercial workshops or villages. Rather than solely utilizing centuries-old traditional motifs, court carpets often share designs found on a range of media, such as bookbinding and manuscript painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although carpets were made in many royal courts, the Ottoman (1281&ndash;1924), the Safavid (1501&ndash;1732), and the Mughal (1526&ndash;1858) Empires provide some of the richest examples of royally produced carpets.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Ottoman Empire originated in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), and was one of the largest and longest lived in the Islamic world. It controlling territories that reached from North Africa to Eastern Europe from 1299 until 1923. Anatolia has a long tradition of carpet weaving, but from the 16th century onward Ottoman court carpets utilized a set of specific designs created by the artists of the Ottoman court workshops, designs that were also used on the court ceramics, paintings, bookbindings, and textiles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the most popular of these was the &ldquo;saz&nbsp;style,&rdquo; which is characterized by long sinuous leaves, and stylized flowers (see below). Court artists also developed the &ldquo;floral style,&rdquo; where we see more naturalistic depictions of flowers such as tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths, among others. The floral and&nbsp;saz&nbsp;styles were sometimes used alone and sometimes used together, along with other motifs like the cintamani pattern (usually a combination of pearl-like circles accompanied by wavy lines sometimes called &quot;tiger stripes&quot;), on a huge variety of objects designed by the court, including ceramics, silks, carpets, and manuscripts.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Both the&nbsp;saz&nbsp;and floral styles appear on this rare Ottoman court prayer rug. The jagged-edged&nbsp;saz&nbsp;leaves gracefully undulate in the border amongst carnations, tulips, and other flowers. The arch at the center of the carpet identifies this as a prayer rug, and symbolizes both amihrab&nbsp;(from mosque architecture) and a gateway to paradise. Such rugs were, and are, used by Muslims during the five daily prayers prescribed in Islam. Though one can go to mosque during the prayer times, prayer can take place anywhere so long as there is a clean surface (provided by the rug) and water for ritual cleansing. A luxurious prayer rug like this would have belonged to a very wealthy court patron.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of this remarkable carpet, the prototype for later designs, may be based on the slender-columned architecture of Muslim Spain. When Muslims and Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, many exiles settled in the Ottoman Empire, bringing with them their own visual culture, which, in turn, influenced Ottoman art. This dual-columned design spawned an entire genre of architecturally-inspired prayer rugs across Anatolia.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Ottoman court carpets is their unusual structure. Unlike all other Turkish carpets, Ottoman court carpets use S-spun wool, which is typical only of carpets woven in Egypt. Scholars attribute this unusual feature to the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, after which the Ottoman court commissioned carpets from Egyptian workshops and had Egyptian weavers and Egyptian wool sent to Turkey for their own use.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Contemporaneous manuscript illustrations shed light on how carpets were used at the court. Though we must remember that paintings are not photographs, and that artists may have invented much in their scenes, paintings like this can nevertheless tell us about the status of carpets in the court. In this painting, ordered by Sultan Murad III, a Safavid dignitary is presented to the Ottoman sultan against the backdrop of a magnificent red and blue Ushak medallion carpet. The painting shows how carpets were used as decorative and symbolic backdrops to Ottoman court rituals. Not only does the carpet provide a sumptuous setting for the ceremony, it also sends a message to the Safavids (political rivals of the Ottomans) about the wealth of the Ottoman court. We can imagine how such a carpet was used to demonstrate to visitors the power, culture, and artistic accomplishments of the Ottomans.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>Safavid court carpets</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Safavids ruled Greater Iran from the early 16th to the 18th century and were avid patrons of the arts. Safavid court carpets are noted for their detailed precision, sumptuous materials, and ornate designs.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Carpet (Safavid), 16th century, Iran, probably Kashan (depicts animals, some invented and of Chinese origin), silk, 94-7/8 x 70 inches (Metropolitan Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/00eff992e3b4bc9e48126dba20aefe0a4041bdfd.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Carpet (Safavid), 16th century, Iran, probably Kashan (depicts animals, some invented and of Chinese origin), silk, 94-7/8 x 70 inches (Metropolitan Museum of Art)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Carpets intended for religious settings, like the Ardabil carpet, display non-figural decoration such as scrolling vines, flower motifs, calligraphy, and&nbsp;shamsas(sunbursts). Carpets made for secular settings, like the court&rsquo;s palaces and pleasure pavilions, display a wider range of motifs, encompassing the designs found on carpets like the Ardabil, but also sometimes including animals, hunting scenes, human figures, and even angels.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The carpet left is a remarkable example of a secular Safavid court carpet. It was woven entirely of silk, and its bright field is filled with animals&mdash;some real, like lions and rams, and others entirely fantastical. The animals, some of which are engaged in intense combat, are set amoungst a lush backdrop of stylized flowers and trees. The popularity of animal and hunting scenes was well established in Iran; hunting was considered a princely pastime in Iran even before the advent of Islam, and continued as a widely used subject in Safavid art.</p>\n"

"<p>As with Ottoman paintings, Safavid manuscript illustrations provide insight into the use of carpets at court.

"<p>Iranian metal bowls have a variety of shapes, decoration themes, and uses during the Safavid period (1501-1736). The Iranian <em>Divination Bowl with Inscriptions and Zodiac Signs</em> today in the Brooklyn Museum&nbsp;is decorated with unusual themes&mdash;a blend of religious, superstitious, and Persian historical motifs.&nbsp;The practice of <em>fāl</em> (divination, or&nbsp;seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by supernatural means) during the Safavid period&nbsp;was facilitated by the use of divine text but it was also influenced by ancient Greek astrology.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

This&nbsp;figure resembles the historical Persian symbol of <em>&Scaron;iro Xor&scaron;id</em>, &quot;the Lion and the Sun,&quot;&nbsp;which&nbsp;eventually became an national emblem and represents, among other things,&nbsp;the ancient history of Persia.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Lion and the Sun symbol was&nbsp;represented on Iranian metalwork in earlier centuries. Scholars suggest that the reason for using this symbol on some Iranian metalwork is to illustrate the triumph of the light over darkness. One can also see the <em>&Scaron;iro Xor&scaron;id</em> as a combination of&nbsp;this&nbsp;traditional Persian symbol and&nbsp;contemporary Shiite religious inclinations. In other words, the lion could be interpreted in relation to the Shiite tradition of representing Imam &lsquo;Ali as a lion since he was historically called <em>Assaduallah</em> (The Lion of God)&nbsp;(Imam &lsquo;Ali is&nbsp;believed by Shia to be Muhammad&#39;s successor in the Caliphate).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Scholars have proposed that zodiac sings were used on Iranian metalwork as early as the second half of the twelfth century and became popular in Islamic art in&nbsp;the thirteenth century. However, some of the images developed by the Greek astronomers were transformed&nbsp;in the Islamic world, bringing them closer&nbsp;to Iranian Shiite culture and&nbsp;theology. For example, there is an association between the twelve zodiac figures and the twelve Shiite Imams.&nbsp;Shiite thought and culture also&nbsp;associates the number twelve with holiness&mdash;as there are twelve months of the year and twelve zodiac&nbsp;signs, there are twelve Imams.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Around the convex hemispherical boss in the bottom of the&nbsp;interior&nbsp;(above), there are three verses from the Qur&rsquo;an. These are divided with circular panels that also include zodiac signs. These verses are from <em>Surat An-NaS </em>(Chapter 110) of the Qura&rsquo;n, verses one, two, and three.&nbsp;These Qur&rsquo;an verses are usually interpreted as God talking to Muhammad, promising him&nbsp;victory over&nbsp;his enemies, the people of Quraish. God is also promising Muhammad that he will conquer Mecca and the city&rsquo;s disbelieving inhabitants will convert to Islam. The content and the revelatory&nbsp;occasion of these verses is a prophecy of victory and glory. Reciting these verses in a prayer or divination practice could be a channel to seeking victory, glory, and a happy life. We might assume that these are the reasons why these verses are inscribed on the bowl (if it was in fact used for divination).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The other two verses from the Qur&rsquo;an inscribed on the bowl are inside the bottom ring on the exterior. These are verses 87 and 88 from <em>Surat Al-&Agrave;nby&acirc;</em> (Chapter 21). However, both of these verses are quoted only partially. The verses are often interpreted as the miraculous story of a believer, <em>Yūnus</em> (Jonah), &nbsp;who was saved by God for&nbsp;his true faith. These verses were likely inscribed on the bowl because it was believed that they have supernatural power. It is still widely believed among Muslims (both Sunnis and Shiites), that reciting certain verses&nbsp;or making some <em>du&lsquo;aā</em> (prayer) will help guide you to the right path and help you seek God&rsquo;s support.</p>\n"

"<p>Iranian metal bowls have a variety of shapes, decoration themes, and uses during the Safavid period (1501-1736). The Iranian <em>Divination Bowl with Inscriptions and Zodiac Signs</em> today in the Brooklyn Museum&nbsp;is decorated with unusual themes&mdash;a blend of religious, superstitious, and Persian historical motifs.&nbsp;The practice of <em>fāl</em> (divination, or&nbsp;seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by supernatural means) during the Safavid period&nbsp;was facilitated by the use of divine text but it was also influenced by ancient Greek astrology.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ancient symbols made new</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The exterior of the divination bowl is covered with both inscriptions and signs of the&nbsp;zodiac. Some of the zodiac signs&nbsp;are represented with&nbsp;traditional figures, but others&nbsp;are more unusual.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7b2cbdec8fdb0074dc1a27eaca0470ce2a7d48a1.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Leo the Lion, <em>Divination Bowl with Inscriptions and Zodiac Signs</em>, mid 16th century, copper alloy (brass), engraved with repouss&eacute; center, 3 3/4 x 8 1/2 x 8 1/2in. / 9.5 x 21.6 x 21.6cm (The Brooklyn Museum)</span></span></p>\n"

This&nbsp;figure resembles the historical Persian symbol of <em>&Scaron;iro Xor&scaron;id</em>, &quot;the Lion and the Sun,&quot;&nbsp;which&nbsp;eventually became an national emblem and represents, among other things,&nbsp;the ancient history of Persia.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Lion and the Sun symbol was&nbsp;represented on Iranian metalwork in earlier centuries. Scholars suggest that the reason for using this symbol on some Iranian metalwork is to illustrate the triumph of the light over darkness. One can also see the <em>&Scaron;iro Xor&scaron;id</em> as a combination of&nbsp;this&nbsp;traditional Persian symbol and&nbsp;contemporary Shiite religious inclinations. In other words, the lion could be interpreted in relation to the Shiite tradition of representing Imam &lsquo;Ali as a lion since he was historically called <em>Assaduallah</em> (The Lion of God)&nbsp;(Imam &lsquo;Ali is&nbsp;believed by Shia to be Muhammad&#39;s successor in the Caliphate).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Scholars have proposed that zodiac sings were used on Iranian metalwork as early as the second half of the twelfth century and became popular in Islamic art in&nbsp;the thirteenth century. However, some of the images developed by the Greek astronomers were transformed&nbsp;in the Islamic world, bringing them closer&nbsp;to Iranian Shiite culture and&nbsp;theology. For example, there is an association between the twelve zodiac figures and the twelve Shiite Imams.&nbsp;Shiite thought and culture also&nbsp;associates the number twelve with holiness&mdash;as there are twelve months of the year and twelve zodiac&nbsp;signs, there are twelve Imams.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/dfff25a721b616059683680068d20a8d6cf24a92.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Interior (detail), <em>Divination Bowl with Inscriptions and Zodiac Signs</em>, mid 16th century, copper alloy (brass), engraved with repouss&eacute; center, 3 3/4 x 8 1/2 x 8 1/2in. / 9.5 x 21.6 x 21.6cm (The Brooklyn Museum)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Around the convex hemispherical boss in the bottom of the&nbsp;interior&nbsp;(above), there are three verses from the Qur&rsquo;an. These are divided with circular panels that also include zodiac signs. These verses are from <em>Surat An-NaS </em>(Chapter 110) of the Qura&rsquo;n, verses one, two, and three.&nbsp;These Qur&rsquo;an verses are usually interpreted as God talking to Muhammad, promising him&nbsp;victory over&nbsp;his enemies, the people of Quraish. God is also promising Muhammad that he will conquer Mecca and the city&rsquo;s disbelieving inhabitants will convert to Islam. The content and the revelatory&nbsp;occasion of these verses is a prophecy of victory and glory. Reciting these verses in a prayer or divination practice could be a channel to seeking victory, glory, and a happy life. We might assume that these are the reasons why these verses are inscribed on the bowl (if it was in fact used for divination).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The other two verses from the Qur&rsquo;an inscribed on the bowl are inside the bottom ring on the exterior. These are verses 87 and 88 from <em>Surat Al-&Agrave;nby&acirc;</em> (Chapter 21). However, both of these verses are quoted only partially. The verses are often interpreted as the miraculous story of a believer, <em>Yūnus</em> (Jonah), &nbsp;who was saved by God for&nbsp;his true faith. These verses were likely inscribed on the bowl because it was believed that they have supernatural power. It is still widely believed among Muslims (both Sunnis and Shiites), that reciting certain verses&nbsp;or making some <em>du&lsquo;aā</em> (prayer) will help guide you to the right path and help you seek God&rsquo;s support.</p>\n"

"<p>When you think of Hell, what images fill your imagination? &nbsp;Your mind might first conjure up a monstrous satanic figure, and then you may further fill in the picture with other beastly devils that roam around torturing damned sinners, who in turn cry out with pain and regret.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>And how about the better parts of the Christian&nbsp;afterlife; how do you imagine them? Perhaps the saved are singing songs of joy, angels are fluttering about, and throngs of holy men and women converse and worship God. &nbsp;To some degree, such imaginings have their origins in the Bible. However, in the Christian West, conceptions of the afterlife evolved quite a bit over the centuries. One important late medieval figure who played a key role in shaping the cultural concepts of life after death&mdash;even to the present day&mdash;is Dante Alighieri, the Florentine poet who was born in the 1260s and died in 1321.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his epic poem known as the<em> Divine Comedy</em>, Dante creates a fictional version of himself who&nbsp;travels through the farthest reaches of&nbsp;hell <em>(Inferno)</em>, purgatory<em> (Purgatorio)</em>&nbsp;and paradise<em> (Paradiso)</em>. Many details that he describes along this journey have left a lasting impression on the Western imagination for more than half a millennium. &nbsp;In fact, the rather stereotypical images of the afterlife I described earlier are all represented in his work. But Dante also&nbsp;found novel ways to portray already well-formed concepts, thus further solidifying them while also reshaping them into new guises that would become&nbsp;familiar to countless generations that followed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Because of Dante&#39;s image-driven descriptions, many artists have sought to illustrate his text through a wide variety of media. &nbsp;Almost immediately after his work was completed, illuminators created images to accompany manuscripts of his masterpiece. More than forty illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em> were created before the advent of the printing press (in the late 15th century). &nbsp;When the potential&nbsp;for faster reproductions of books&mdash;including illustrated books&mdash;became a reality, Dante&#39;s imagination, sometimes intertwined with the imagination of an artist rendering a visual interpretation of his words, reached an even larger audience than before. &nbsp;We will look here at two outstanding examples of how Dante&#39;s words fed the creative imagination of visual artists before and shortly after the invention of the printing press. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The influence of art on Dante&#39;s world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before looking at Dante&#39;s influence on the visual arts, however, we need take a little step back in time. &nbsp;The relationship between Dante and the arts was a reciprocal one; images he had seen also greatly influenced his literary vision. Were there any sights, sounds or works of art you saw as a child that you can still easily call to mind today? If you were writing a fictional story that relied heavily on your own imagination, could you see yourself drawing from these vivid sensorial experiences and making them a part of that story? This was the case for Dante.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mosaic (detail) of the Last Judgment on the ceiling of the Florence Baptistry\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2bf68a41eaecac45d3a31838d3daa261f8b7a675.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Mosaic (detail) of the Satan in the Last Judgment on the ceiling of the Florence Baptistry (13th century)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Florence was full of artistic marvels well before the Renaissance. &nbsp;Incredible works of art and architecture filled the city well before Dante&#39;s birth in late medieval times. The Florence Baptistery (illustrated above), which Dante fondly referred to in his <em>Comedy</em> as his &quot;bel (beautiful) San Giovanni,&quot;&nbsp;is one such example, which the poet would have known well, even from the days of his youth. The ceiling inside the baptistery is covered with mosaic images that still dazzle visitors today. There are many indications that Dante too was dazzled by the sight. Quite a few correspondences can be discerned between certain descriptions in the <em>Comedy</em> and particular images within this baptistery&mdash;indeed, too many to be mere coincidence. &nbsp;For example, at the end of the <em>Inferno</em>, when Dante&#39;s fictional self&nbsp;reaches the deepest part of Hell and encounters &quot;the emperor of the dolorous kingdom&quot; (Satan),&nbsp;&nbsp;Dante&rsquo;s description is strikingly specific. &nbsp;Satan has three mouths, and &quot;In each of his mouths he was breaking a sinner/&nbsp;with his teeth in the manner of a scutch, so that he made the three suffer at once&quot;&nbsp;(translation by Durling and Martinez)&mdash;just like the image of Satan inside the Florence Baptistery. &nbsp;The link to this mosaic image is just one example of how the visual arts passed from Dante&rsquo;s memory through his imagination and onto the pages of his epic poem.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After a childhood and adolescence no doubt filled with sights of Florentine artistic wonders, Dante&rsquo;s familiarity with the visual arts matured. &nbsp;In <em>Purgatorio </em>XI his understanding of various forms of visual arts and artists is especially evident. &nbsp;Through a conversation between his fictional self and the manuscript illuminator Oderisi da Gubbio, Dante discusses the fading glory of artists, always eclipsed by another&rsquo;s&nbsp;greatness. &nbsp;He writes that just as Franco Bolognese surpassed his master Oderisi in illumination, and Giotto surpassed Cimabue in painting&mdash;in poetry, a certain unnamed poet (that is, Dante) just may have outdone Guido Cavalcanti and Guido Guinizelli.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Dante implies that there are similarities between the written word and the painted picture, as he directly associates these mediums and their practitioners with one another. Certainly, poets like Dante learned from and were influenced by artists, and as we will now see, visual artists were also greatly affected by poets such as this great Florentine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Yates-Thompson Codex</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the dozens of illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, one of the most outstanding is known as the Yates-Thompson Codex, which is located in the British Library.&nbsp;It was originally carried out for Alfonso V, the king of Aragon, Naples and Sicily, either as a gift or under his commission. &nbsp;The manuscript was produced in Siena in the 1440s, and two illuminators&nbsp;worked&nbsp;on the 112 framed miniatures. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>In the&nbsp;illumination from the fifth canto (in epic poetry,&nbsp;a canto is a division&nbsp;similar to a chapter) of the <em>Inferno</em> pictured here, Dante (in blue) and his guide, the ancient Roman poet Virgil (in red), pass through the circle of the lustful. The artist captures three distinct moments from this canto in one image. The first moment is shown in the upper left corner in the form of the snarling beast. This is Minos, who determines where in Hell a sinner will be sent, and who briefly impedes Dante&rsquo;s journey until Virgil rebukes him and the two move onward. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Next, just to the right of Minos, Virgil explains the mysterious group of people who are tossed about by a whirlwind, and he identifies individual figures among them. Third, on the far right,&nbsp;a couple facing&nbsp;left&nbsp;converses&nbsp;with the Dante and Virgil. &nbsp;They are there as a visual reference to the extended dialogue between Dante and one pair of lustful sinners, Paolo and Francesca. &nbsp;At the end of the canto Dante faints with pity, and in the center of this image he is shown on his knee&mdash;preparing, it seems, to fully lose consciousness.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In a number of illustrated accompaniments to the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, there are no images to complement Paradiso, and for understandable reasons. While <em>Inferno</em> and <em>Purgatorio </em>describe physically tangible experiences, the <em>Paradiso</em> is elusive and philosophical. The very spaces through which Dante and his paradisiacal guide Beatrice travel defy physical properties.&nbsp;The illuminator for these scenes,&nbsp;Giovanni di Paolo, however, was well up for this task and executed a masterful set of images to accompany this most difficult part of the <em>Comedy</em>. Rejecting natural physical laws, Dante and Beatrice are shown throughout these illustrations as if they are hovering above the ground, as they are in this&nbsp;image, which illustrates the second canto.</p>\n"

"<p>When you think of Hell, what images fill your imagination? &nbsp;Your mind might first conjure up a monstrous satanic figure, and then you may further fill in the picture with other beastly devils that roam around torturing damned sinners, who in turn cry out with pain and regret.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>And how about the better parts of the Christian&nbsp;afterlife; how do you imagine them? Perhaps the saved are singing songs of joy, angels are fluttering about, and throngs of holy men and women converse and worship God. &nbsp;To some degree, such imaginings have their origins in the Bible. However, in the Christian West, conceptions of the afterlife evolved quite a bit over the centuries. One important late medieval figure who played a key role in shaping the cultural concepts of life after death&mdash;even to the present day&mdash;is Dante Alighieri, the Florentine poet who was born in the 1260s and died in 1321.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his epic poem known as the<em> Divine Comedy</em>, Dante creates a fictional version of himself who&nbsp;travels through the farthest reaches of&nbsp;hell <em>(Inferno)</em>, purgatory<em> (Purgatorio)</em>&nbsp;and paradise<em> (Paradiso)</em>. Many details that he describes along this journey have left a lasting impression on the Western imagination for more than half a millennium. &nbsp;In fact, the rather stereotypical images of the afterlife I described earlier are all represented in his work. But Dante also&nbsp;found novel ways to portray already well-formed concepts, thus further solidifying them while also reshaping them into new guises that would become&nbsp;familiar to countless generations that followed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Because of Dante&#39;s image-driven descriptions, many artists have sought to illustrate his text through a wide variety of media. &nbsp;Almost immediately after his work was completed, illuminators created images to accompany manuscripts of his masterpiece. More than forty illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em> were created before the advent of the printing press (in the late 15th century). &nbsp;When the potential&nbsp;for faster reproductions of books&mdash;including illustrated books&mdash;became a reality, Dante&#39;s imagination, sometimes intertwined with the imagination of an artist rendering a visual interpretation of his words, reached an even larger audience than before. &nbsp;We will look here at two outstanding examples of how Dante&#39;s words fed the creative imagination of visual artists before and shortly after the invention of the printing press. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The influence of art on Dante&#39;s world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before looking at Dante&#39;s influence on the visual arts, however, we need take a little step back in time. &nbsp;The relationship between Dante and the arts was a reciprocal one; images he had seen also greatly influenced his literary vision. Were there any sights, sounds or works of art you saw as a child that you can still easily call to mind today? If you were writing a fictional story that relied heavily on your own imagination, could you see yourself drawing from these vivid sensorial experiences and making them a part of that story? This was the case for Dante.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mosaic (detail) of the Last Judgment on the ceiling of the Florence Baptistry\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2bf68a41eaecac45d3a31838d3daa261f8b7a675.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Mosaic (detail) of the Satan in the Last Judgment on the ceiling of the Florence Baptistry (13th century)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Florence was full of artistic marvels well before the Renaissance. &nbsp;Incredible works of art and architecture filled the city well before Dante&#39;s birth in late medieval times. The Florence Baptistery (illustrated above), which Dante fondly referred to in his <em>Comedy</em> as his &quot;bel (beautiful) San Giovanni,&quot;&nbsp;is one such example, which the poet would have known well, even from the days of his youth. The ceiling inside the baptistery is covered with mosaic images that still dazzle visitors today. There are many indications that Dante too was dazzled by the sight. Quite a few correspondences can be discerned between certain descriptions in the <em>Comedy</em> and particular images within this baptistery&mdash;indeed, too many to be mere coincidence. &nbsp;For example, at the end of the <em>Inferno</em>, when Dante&#39;s fictional self&nbsp;reaches the deepest part of Hell and encounters &quot;the emperor of the dolorous kingdom&quot; (Satan),&nbsp;&nbsp;Dante&rsquo;s description is strikingly specific. &nbsp;Satan has three mouths, and &quot;In each of his mouths he was breaking a sinner/&nbsp;with his teeth in the manner of a scutch, so that he made the three suffer at once&quot;&nbsp;(translation by Durling and Martinez)&mdash;just like the image of Satan inside the Florence Baptistery. &nbsp;The link to this mosaic image is just one example of how the visual arts passed from Dante&rsquo;s memory through his imagination and onto the pages of his epic poem.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After a childhood and adolescence no doubt filled with sights of Florentine artistic wonders, Dante&rsquo;s familiarity with the visual arts matured. &nbsp;In <em>Purgatorio </em>XI his understanding of various forms of visual arts and artists is especially evident. &nbsp;Through a conversation between his fictional self and the manuscript illuminator Oderisi da Gubbio, Dante discusses the fading glory of artists, always eclipsed by another&rsquo;s&nbsp;greatness. &nbsp;He writes that just as Franco Bolognese surpassed his master Oderisi in illumination, and Giotto surpassed Cimabue in painting&mdash;in poetry, a certain unnamed poet (that is, Dante) just may have outdone Guido Cavalcanti and Guido Guinizelli.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Dante implies that there are similarities between the written word and the painted picture, as he directly associates these mediums and their practitioners with one another. Certainly, poets like Dante learned from and were influenced by artists, and as we will now see, visual artists were also greatly affected by poets such as this great Florentine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Yates-Thompson Codex</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the dozens of illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, one of the most outstanding is known as the Yates-Thompson Codex, which is located in the British Library.&nbsp;It was originally carried out for Alfonso V, the king of Aragon, Naples and Sicily, either as a gift or under his commission. &nbsp;The manuscript was produced in Siena in the 1440s, and two illuminators&nbsp;worked&nbsp;on the 112 framed miniatures. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In the&nbsp;illumination from the fifth canto (in epic poetry,&nbsp;a canto is a division&nbsp;similar to a chapter) of the <em>Inferno</em> pictured here, Dante (in blue) and his guide, the ancient Roman poet Virgil (in red), pass through the circle of the lustful. The artist captures three distinct moments from this canto in one image. The first moment is shown in the upper left corner in the form of the snarling beast. This is Minos, who determines where in Hell a sinner will be sent, and who briefly impedes Dante&rsquo;s journey until Virgil rebukes him and the two move onward. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Detail of a miniature of Virgil addressing Paolo and Francesca, as Dante swoons in horror, in illustration of Canto V, Yates Thompson 36, f. 10\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0dad27949edf97e1d2885a8eb1b35584036d3ccc.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Detail of a miniature of the lustful being carried about by a wind with Paolo and Francesca on the far right, in illustration of Canto V, Yates Thompson 36, f. 10,&nbsp;&nbsp;1444-c. 1450 (The British Museum)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Next, just to the right of Minos, Virgil explains the mysterious group of people who are tossed about by a whirlwind, and he identifies individual figures among them. Third, on the far right,&nbsp;a couple facing&nbsp;left&nbsp;converses&nbsp;with the Dante and Virgil. &nbsp;They are there as a visual reference to the extended dialogue between Dante and one pair of lustful sinners, Paolo and Francesca. &nbsp;At the end of the canto Dante faints with pity, and in the center of this image he is shown on his knee&mdash;preparing, it seems, to fully lose consciousness.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In a number of illustrated accompaniments to the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, there are no images to complement Paradiso, and for understandable reasons. While <em>Inferno</em> and <em>Purgatorio </em>describe physically tangible experiences, the <em>Paradiso</em> is elusive and philosophical. The very spaces through which Dante and his paradisiacal guide Beatrice travel defy physical properties.&nbsp;The illuminator for these scenes,&nbsp;Giovanni di Paolo, however, was well up for this task and executed a masterful set of images to accompany this most difficult part of the <em>Comedy</em>. Rejecting natural physical laws, Dante and Beatrice are shown throughout these illustrations as if they are hovering above the ground, as they are in this&nbsp;image, which illustrates the second canto.</p>\n"

"<p><span>In ancient Rome equestrian statues of emperors would not have been uncommon sights in the city&mdash;late antique sources suggest that at least 22 of these &ldquo;great horses&rdquo; (<em>equi magni</em>) were to be seen&mdash;as they were official devices for honoring the emperor for singular military and civic achievements. The statues themselves were, in turn, copied in other media, including coins, for even wider distribution. Few examples of these equestrian statues survive from antiquity, however, making the <em>Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius</em> a singular artifact of Roman antiquity, one that has borne quiet witness to the ebb and flow of the city of Rome for nearly 1,900 years. A gilded bronze monument of the 170s C.E. that was originally dedicated to the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, referred to commonly as Marcus Aurelius (reigned 161-180 C.E.), the statue is an important object not only for the study of official Roman portraiture, but also for the consideration of monumental dedications. Further, the&nbsp;use of the statue&nbsp;in the Medieval, Renaissance, modern, and post-modern city of Rome has important implications for the connectivity that exists between the past and the present.</span></p>\n"

The horse&rsquo;s body&mdash;in particular its musculature&mdash;has been modeled very carefully by the artist, resulting in a powerful rendering.

The interpretation of these portraits relies on various key elements, especially the reading of hairstyle and the examination of facial physiognomy. In the case of the equestrian statue, the portrait typology offers the best means of assigning an approximate date to the object since it does not otherwise offer another means of dating.&nbsp;The earliest portrait of Marcus Aurelius dates to c. 140 C.E. and is best represented by the Capitoline Galleria 28 type, where&nbsp;the youth wears a cloak fastened at the shoulder (<em>paludamentum</em>); this portrait was widely circulated, with approximately&nbsp;25 known copies (above, left).</p>\n"

"<h3>Interpretation and chronology</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The interpretation and chronology of the equestrian statue must rely on the statue itself, as no ancient literary testimony or other evidence survives to aid in the interpretation. It is obvious that the statue is part of an elaborate public monument, no doubt commissioned to mark an important occasion in the emperor&rsquo;s reign. With that said, however, it must also be noted that scholars continue to debate its precise dating, the occasion for its creation, and its likely original location in the city of Rome.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Starting with the portrait typology it is possible to determine a range of likely dates for the statue&rsquo;s creation. The portrait is clearly an adult type of the emperor, meaning the statue must have been created after 161 C.E., the year of Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; accession and the creation of his third portrait type. This provides a <em>terminus post quem</em>&nbsp;(the limit after which) for the equestrian statue. Art historians have debated whether the portrait head most resembles the Type III or the Type IV portrait. Recent scholarly thinking, based on the work of Klaus Fittschen, holds that the equestrian portrait represents a unique variant of the standard Type III portrait, created as an improvisation by the artist who was commissioned to create the equestrian statue. In the end the precise chronology of the portrait head&mdash;and indeed the typology&mdash;remains a matter of scholarly debate.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The original location of the equestrian monument also remains debated, with some supporting a location on the Caelian Hill near the barracks of the imperial cavalry (equites singulares), while others favor the Campus Martius &nbsp;(a low-lying alluvial plain of the Tiber River)&nbsp;&nbsp;as a possible location. A text known as the <em>Liber Pontificalis</em> that dates to the middle of the tenth century C.E. mentions the equestrian monument, referring to it as &ldquo;<em>caballus Constantini</em>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;horse of Constantine.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to&nbsp;the text, the urban prefect of Rome was condemned following an uprising against Pope John XII and, as punishment, was hung by the hair from the equestrian monument. At this time the equestrian statue was located in the Lateran quarter of the city of Rome near the Lateran Palace, where it may have been since at least the eighth century C.E. Popular theories at the time held that the bearded emperor was in fact Constantine I, thus sparing the statue from being melted down.</p>\n"

It has borne witness to the city&rsquo;s imperial glory, post-imperial decline,&nbsp;its Renaissance resurgence, and even its quotidian experience in the twenty-first century. In so doing it reminds us about the role of public art in creating and reinforcing cultural identity as it relates to specific events and locations. In the ancient world the equestrian statue would have evoked powerful memories from the viewer, not only reinforcing the identity and appearance of the emperor but also calling to mind the key events, achievements, and celebrations of his administration. The statue is, like the city, eternal, as reflected by the Romanesco&nbsp;poet Giuseppe Belli who reflects in his sonnet <em>Campidojjo</em> (1830) that the gilded statue is directly linked to the long sweep of Rome&rsquo;s history.</p>\n"

"<p><span>In ancient Rome equestrian statues of emperors would not have been uncommon sights in the city&mdash;late antique sources suggest that at least 22 of these &ldquo;great horses&rdquo; (<em>equi magni</em>) were to be seen&mdash;as they were official devices for honoring the emperor for singular military and civic achievements. The statues themselves were, in turn, copied in other media, including coins, for even wider distribution. Few examples of these equestrian statues survive from antiquity, however, making the <em>Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius</em> a singular artifact of Roman antiquity, one that has borne quiet witness to the ebb and flow of the city of Rome for nearly 1,900 years. A gilded bronze monument of the 170s C.E. that was originally dedicated to the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, referred to commonly as Marcus Aurelius (reigned 161-180 C.E.), the statue is an important object not only for the study of official Roman portraiture, but also for the consideration of monumental dedications. Further, the&nbsp;use of the statue&nbsp;in the Medieval, Renaissance, modern, and post-modern city of Rome has important implications for the connectivity that exists between the past and the present.</span></p>\n"

"<p>The statue is an over life-size depiction of the emperor elegantly mounted atop his horse while participating in a public ritual or ceremony; the statue stands approximately 4.24 meters tall. A gilded&nbsp;bronze statue, the piece was originally cast using the lost-wax technique, with horse and rider cast in multiple pieces and then soldered together after casting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The horse, caught in motion, raises its right foreleg at the knee while planting its left foreleg on the ground, its motion checked by the application of reins, which the emperor originally held in his left hand. The horse&rsquo;s body&mdash;in particular its musculature&mdash;has been modeled very carefully by the artist, resulting in a powerful rendering. In keeping with the motion of the horse&rsquo;s body, its head turns to its right, with its mouth opened slightly. The horse wears a harness, some elements of which have not survived. The horse is saddled with a Persian-style saddlecloth of several layers, as opposed to a rigid saddle. It should be noted that the horse is an important and expressive element of the overall composition.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In the Roman world it was standard practice to create official portrait types of high-ranking officials, such as emperors that would then circulate in various media, notably sculpture in the round and coin portraits. These portrait types are vital in several respects, especially for determining the chronology of monuments and coins, since the portrait types can usually be placed in a fairly accurate and legible chronological order. The interpretation of these portraits relies on various key elements, especially the reading of hairstyle and the examination of facial physiognomy. In the case of the equestrian statue, the portrait typology offers the best means of assigning an approximate date to the object since it does not otherwise offer another means of dating.&nbsp;The earliest portrait of Marcus Aurelius dates to c. 140 C.E. and is best represented by the Capitoline Galleria 28 type, where&nbsp;the youth wears a cloak fastened at the shoulder (<em>paludamentum</em>); this portrait was widely circulated, with approximately&nbsp;25 known copies (above, left).</p>\n"

In the ancient world the equestrian statue would have evoked powerful memories from the viewer, not only reinforcing the identity and appearance of the emperor but also calling to mind the key events, achievements, and celebrations of his administration. The statue is, like the city, eternal, as reflected by the Romanesco&nbsp;poet Giuseppe Belli who reflects in his sonnet <em>Campidojjo</em> (1830) that the gilded statue is directly linked to the long sweep of Rome&rsquo;s history.</p>\n"

Highsmith Archive, Library of Congress #LC-DIG-highsm-04261)</span></span><span>Perched above a mountain cataract on a rocky hillside deep in the rugged forest of Southwestern Pennsylvania, some 90 minutes from Pittsburgh, is America&rsquo;s most famous house. The commission for Fallingwater was a personal milestone for the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, since it&nbsp;clearly marked a turning point in his career. After this late-career triumph, the sixty-seven year old would go on to create a series of highly original designs that would validate his claim as &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s greatest architect.&rdquo;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;the greatest architect of the&nbsp;nineteenth-century&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&mdash;Philip Johnson</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mid-1930s were among the darkest years for architecture and architects in American history; the country&rsquo;s financial system had collapsed with the failure of hundreds of banks. Almost no private homes were built. Many of the architectural projects started during the boom of the late 1920s were halted for lack of funds. Now in his sixties, Wright and his new wife Olgivanna were struggling to keep Taliesin, his Wisconsin home and studio, out of foreclosure. Worse still, his peers were beginning to regard Wright as an irrelevant anachronism whose time had passed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1932 Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson opened the &quot;Modern Architecture:&nbsp;International Exhibition&quot; at the newly founded Museum of Modern Art in New York and simultaneously&nbsp;published the book&nbsp;<em>International Style</em>. This was, perhaps, the most influential architectural exhibit ever mounted in the United States and the book became a manifesto for modern architecture and would profoundly affect almost every major architectural project worldwide for the next 30 years. It focused on the work of four great &ldquo;European functionalists&rdquo;&quot;&nbsp;Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and J.J.P. Oud. Wright was largely snubbed.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Hitchcock had praise for his early work, for its &ldquo;many innovations,&quot;&nbsp;but he condemned Wright for a&nbsp;&ldquo;[l]ack of continuity in his development and his unwillingness to absorb the innovations of his contemporaries and his juniors in Europe.&rdquo; Hitchcock insulted Wright further by characterizing him as &ldquo;a rebel by temperament&hellip; [who] refused even the discipline of his own theories.&rdquo; The catalogue calls Wright a &ldquo;half-modern&rdquo; throwback, one of the &ldquo;last representatives of Romanticism.&rdquo;&nbsp;Wright responded by denigrating European Modernism as an &ldquo;evil crusade,&rdquo; a manifestation of &ldquo;totalitarianism.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A fellowship and a commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Wrights devised an architectural apprenticeship program that came to be known as the &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; And among the first candidates was Edgar Kaufmann Jr. who&nbsp;became enamored with Wright after reading his biography. Kaufmann was the son of Pittsburgh department store tycoon Edgar Kaufmann Sr.; whose thirteen story downtown Pittsburgh emporium was reported to be the largest in the world. Kaufmann senior was no stranger to architectural pursuits&mdash;he was&nbsp;involved in numerous public projects and&nbsp;built several stores and homes. Kaufmann&nbsp;let&nbsp;Wright know that he had several civic architectural projects in mind for him. He and his wife Liliane were invited to Taliesin and were duly impressed.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>There are varying accounts regarding the circumstances that brought Kaufmann to offer Wright a chance to design a &ldquo;weekend home&rdquo; in the country; but we know that Wright made his first trip to the site on Bear Run, Pennsylvania in December, 1934. Wright&rsquo;s apprentice Donald Hoppen has spoken of Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;uncanny sense&nbsp;of...genius loci&rdquo;1 (Latin for &quot;spirit of the place&quot;) and from the very beginning, the architect rejected a site that presented a conventional view of the waterfall; instead, he audaciously offered to make the house part of it, stating that the &ldquo;visit to the waterfall in the woods stays with me and a domicile takes shape in my mind to the music of the stream.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>The South-southeast orientation gives the illusion that the stream flows, not alongside the house, but through it.</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Fastest draw in the Midwest</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the most famous tale to come out of the lore of Fallingwater is the improbable story that Wright, after receiving the commission procrastinated for nine months until he was forced to draw up the complete plans while his patron was driving&nbsp;the 140 miles from Milwaukee to Taliesin. However, the essential story is validated by several witnesses. Apprentice Edgar Taffel recalled that after talking with Kaufmann on the phone, Wright &ldquo;briskly emerged from his office...sat down at the table set with the plot plan and started to draw&hellip;The design just poured out of him. &#39;Liliane and E.J. will have tea on the balcony&hellip;they&rsquo;ll cross the bridge to walk in the woods&hellip;&#39;&nbsp;Pencils being used up as fast as we could sharpen them....Erasures, overdrawing, modifying. Flipping sheets back and forth. Then, the bold title across the bottom &lsquo;Fallingwater.&rsquo; A house has to have a name.&rdquo;2&nbsp;There seems to be agreement that the whole process took about two hours.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Organic architecture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Edgar Kaufmann Jr. pointed&nbsp;out that Wright&rsquo;s famous concept of &ldquo;Organic Architecture&rdquo; stems from his Transcendentalist background. The belief that human life is part of nature. Wright even incorporated a rock outcropping that projected above the living room floor into his massive central hearth,&nbsp;further uniting the house with the earth. &ldquo;Can you say&rdquo; Wright challenged his apprentices &ldquo;when your building is&nbsp;<span>complete, that the landscape is more beautiful than it was before?&rdquo;3</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his book, <em>Fallingwater Rising: Frank Lloyd Wright, E. J. Kaufmann, and America&#39;s Most Extraordinary House</em>, Franklin Toker wrote that,&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>this delicate synthesis of nature and the built environment probably counts as the main reason why Fallingwater is such a well-loved work. The contouring of the house into cantilevered ledges responds so sympathetically to the rock strata of the stream banks that it does make Bear Run a more wondrous landscape than it had been before.4</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Frank Lloyd Wright, Fallingwater (Edgar Kauffmann House), Bear Run, Pennsylvannia, 1937 (photo: Lykantrop) http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Frank_Lloyd_Wright_-_Fallingwater_interior_2.JPG \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b7db38d3dee718368051e0047d0ee3a573421508.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Frank Lloyd Wright, Fallingwater (Edgar J.

This provides elongated vistas leading the eye out to the horizon and the woods. Vincent Scully has pointed out that this reflects &ldquo;an image of Modern man caught up in constant change and flow, holding on&hellip;to whatever seems solid&nbsp;but no&nbsp;longer regarding&nbsp;himself as the center of the world.&rdquo;5&nbsp;The architect&rsquo;s creative use of &ldquo;corner turning windows&rdquo; without mullions causes&nbsp;corners to vanish. Wright even bows to nature by bending a trellis beam to accommodate a pre-existing tree.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Influences</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although he denied it, Wright&nbsp;was influenced by every conceivable architectural style, but Fallingwater owes little to his previous designs (the only exceptions being perhaps&nbsp;the use of irregular stones that are also found on Taliesin and his interest in strong horizontal lines). At Fallingwater, he appears to be more concerned with responding to the European Modernist design that he had in part inspired&mdash;but that had since eclipsed him. In effect, he set out to beat the Europeans at their own game, using elements of their idiom.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Fallingwater&nbsp;falling down?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Kaufmanns loved Wright&rsquo;s radical proposal to literally suspend the house over the waterfall. But Edgar Kaufmann Sr., ever the pragmatic business man&nbsp;(who had also studied engineering for a year at Yale) prudently sent a copy of Wright&rsquo;s blueprints to his engineer; who found the ground unstable and did not recommend that he proceed with the house. Wright was not happy with his client&rsquo;s lack of faith, but permitted an increase in the number and diameter of the structure&#39;s steel reinforcements&mdash;Kaufmann agreed to proceed. Its worth noting that the engineer&rsquo;s warnings later proved valid, an issue that &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; Wright for the rest of his life.<br />\n"

"<p>Wright is famous for pushing the architectural envelope for dramatic effect. We see this is in the vast cantilevered wooden roof of Robie House in Chicago.

The commission for Fallingwater was a personal milestone for the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, since it&nbsp;clearly marked a turning point in his career. After this late-career triumph, the sixty-seven year old would go on to create a series of highly original designs that would validate his claim as &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s greatest architect.&rdquo;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;the greatest architect of the&nbsp;nineteenth-century&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&mdash;Philip Johnson</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mid-1930s were among the darkest years for architecture and architects in American history; the country&rsquo;s financial system had collapsed with the failure of hundreds of banks. Almost no private homes were built. Many of the architectural projects started during the boom of the late 1920s were halted for lack of funds. Now in his sixties, Wright and his new wife Olgivanna were struggling to keep Taliesin, his Wisconsin home and studio, out of foreclosure. Worse still, his peers were beginning to regard Wright as an irrelevant anachronism whose time had passed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1932 Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson opened the &quot;Modern Architecture:&nbsp;International Exhibition&quot; at the newly founded Museum of Modern Art in New York and simultaneously&nbsp;published the book&nbsp;<em>International Style</em>. This was, perhaps, the most influential architectural exhibit ever mounted in the United States and the book became a manifesto for modern architecture and would profoundly affect almost every major architectural project worldwide for the next 30 years. It focused on the work of four great &ldquo;European functionalists&rdquo;&quot;&nbsp;Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and J.J.P. Oud. Wright was largely snubbed.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Hitchcock had praise for his early work, for its &ldquo;many innovations,&quot;&nbsp;but he condemned Wright for a&nbsp;&ldquo;[l]ack of continuity in his development and his unwillingness to absorb the innovations of his contemporaries and his juniors in Europe.&rdquo; Hitchcock insulted Wright further by characterizing him as &ldquo;a rebel by temperament&hellip; [who] refused even the discipline of his own theories.&rdquo; The catalogue calls Wright a &ldquo;half-modern&rdquo; throwback, one of the &ldquo;last representatives of Romanticism.&rdquo;&nbsp;Wright responded by denigrating European Modernism as an &ldquo;evil crusade,&rdquo; a manifestation of &ldquo;totalitarianism.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A fellowship and a commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Wrights devised an architectural apprenticeship program that came to be known as the &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; And among the first candidates was Edgar Kaufmann Jr. who&nbsp;became enamored with Wright after reading his biography. Kaufmann was the son of Pittsburgh department store tycoon Edgar Kaufmann Sr.; whose thirteen story downtown Pittsburgh emporium was reported to be the largest in the world. Kaufmann senior was no stranger to architectural pursuits&mdash;he was&nbsp;involved in numerous public projects and&nbsp;built several stores and homes. Kaufmann&nbsp;let&nbsp;Wright know that he had several civic architectural projects in mind for him. He and his wife Liliane were invited to Taliesin and were duly impressed.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>There are varying accounts regarding the circumstances that brought Kaufmann to offer Wright a chance to design a &ldquo;weekend home&rdquo; in the country; but we know that Wright made his first trip to the site on Bear Run, Pennsylvania in December, 1934. Wright&rsquo;s apprentice Donald Hoppen has spoken of his Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;uncanny sense&nbsp;of...genius loci&rdquo;1 (Latin for &quot;spirit of the place&quot;) and from the very beginning, the architect rejected a site that presented a conventional view of the waterfall; instead, he audaciously offered to make the house part of it, stating that the &ldquo;visit to the waterfall in the woods stays with me and a domicile takes shape in my mind to the music of the stream.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>The South-southeast orientation gives the illusion that the stream flows, not alongside the house, but through it.</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Fastest draw in the Midwest</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the most famous tale to come out of the lore of Fallingwater is the improbable story that Wright, after receiving the commission procrastinated for nine months until he was forced to draw up the complete plans while his patron was driving&nbsp;the 140 miles from Milwaukee to Taliesin. However, the essential story is validated by several witnesses. Apprentice Edgar Taffel recalled that after talking with Kaufmann on the phone, Wright &ldquo;briskly emerged from his office...sat down at the table set with the plot plan and started to draw&hellip;The design just poured out of him. &#39;Liliane and E.J. will have tea on the balcony&hellip;they&rsquo;ll cross the bridge to walk in the woods&hellip;&#39;&nbsp;Pencils being used up as fast as we could sharpen them....Erasures, overdrawing, modifying. Flipping sheets back and forth. Then, the bold title across the bottom &lsquo;Fallingwater.&rsquo; A house has to have a name.&rdquo;2&nbsp;There seems to be agreement that the whole process took about two hours.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Organic architecture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Edgar Kaufmann Jr. pointed&nbsp;out that Wright&rsquo;s famous concept of &ldquo;Organic Architecture&rdquo; stems from his Transcendentalist background. The belief that human life is part of nature. Wright even incorporated a rock outcropping that projected above the living room floor into his massive central hearth,&nbsp;further uniting the house with the earth. &ldquo;Can you say&rdquo; Wright challenged his apprentices &ldquo;when your building is&nbsp;<span>complete, that the landscape is more beautiful than it was before?&rdquo;3</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his book, <em>Fallingwater Rising: Frank Lloyd Wright, E. J. Kaufmann, and America&#39;s Most Extraordinary House</em>, Franklin Toker wrote that,&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>this delicate synthesis of nature and the built environment probably counts as the main reason why Fallingwater is such a well-loved work. The contouring of the house into cantilevered ledges responds so sympathetically to the rock strata of the stream banks that it does make Bear Run a more wondrous landscape than it had been before.4</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Frank Lloyd Wright, Fallingwater (Edgar Kauffmann House), Bear Run, Pennsylvannia, 1937 (photo: Lykantrop) http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Frank_Lloyd_Wright_-_Fallingwater_interior_2.JPG \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b7db38d3dee718368051e0047d0ee3a573421508.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Frank Lloyd Wright, Fallingwater (Edgar J.

This provides elongated vistas leading the eye out to the horizon and the woods. Vincent Scully has pointed out that this reflects &ldquo;an image of Modern man caught up in constant change and flow, holding on&hellip;to whatever seems solid&nbsp;but no&nbsp;longer regarding&nbsp;himself as the center of the world.&rdquo;5&nbsp;The architect&rsquo;s creative use of &ldquo;corner turning windows&rdquo; without mullions causes&nbsp;corners to vanish. Wright even bows to nature by bending a trellis beam to accommodate a pre-existing tree.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Influences</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although he denied it, Wright&nbsp;was influenced by every conceivable architectural style, but Fallingwater owes little to his previous designs (the only exceptions being perhaps&nbsp;the use of irregular stones that are also found on Taliesin and his interest in strong horizontal lines). At Fallingwater, he appears to be more concerned with responding to the European Modernist design that he had in part inspired&mdash;but that had since eclipsed him. In effect, he set out to beat the Europeans at their own game, using elements of their idiom.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Fallingwater&nbsp;falling down?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Kaufmanns loved Wright&rsquo;s radical proposal to literally suspend the house over the waterfall. But Edgar Kaufmann Sr., ever the pragmatic business man&nbsp;(who had also studied engineering for a year at Yale) prudently sent a copy of Wright&rsquo;s blueprints to his engineer; who found the ground unstable and did not recommend that he proceed with the house. Wright was not happy with his client&rsquo;s lack of faith, but permitted an increase in the number and diameter of the structure&#39;s steel reinforcements&mdash;Kaufmann agreed to proceed. Its worth noting that the engineer&rsquo;s warnings later proved valid, an issue that &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; Wright for the rest of his life.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Minotaur myth</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>The Minotaur</em> belongs to his later, symbolic works and illustrates a scene from the famous ancient Greek myth.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After her defeat by the Cretans, the story goes, the city of Athens was forced every nine years to send as tribute seven youths and seven maidens. A ship, bearing a black sail, ferried the victims across the Aegean Sea to the land of their subjugators. Once on shore they were sent to the fabled Labyrinth of Daedalus, an impossibly complex maze-like structure, as large as a town. It was here the Minotaur lived; half-human and half-bull, conceived through the preternatural coupling of Pasipha&euml;, the wife of King Minos, and the Cretan Bull.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One by one the beast would pick them off, wandering, half-starved and utterly disorientated, searching desperately for a way out, only to meet their gruesome end with a savage business of goring, pummeling and devouring.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Pablo Picasso, Dying Minotaur, Plate from The Vollard Suite, etching, 1933\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ee99585abffd0c696ebc8c6c3b1e5134737be6ae.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pablo Picasso, <em>Dying Minotaur,</em> Plate from the <em>Vollard Suite</em>, etching, 1933</span></span>A monstrous aberration of nature in western art and literature, the Minotaur came to embody the violent, bestial impulses of man. In the twentieth century however, in Picasso&rsquo;s etchings and the writings of Jorge Luis Borges, for example, the creature has been viewed more sympathetically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Borges, he is a prisoner, painfully unaware of the crime he has committed, who longs for nothing but to be killed. For Picasso, the Minotaur is a tragic figure, dying a pitiful death in his <em>Vollard Suite</em>. For the Victorians, though, the Minotaur was just plain evil, the embodiment of violence and depravity, an association that was dramatically exploited in one of the most effective journalistic campaigns of the nineteenth century.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&rdquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1885 the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> published a series of articles by William Thomas Stead that proved a milestone in the history of modern journalism. At the time Parliament was delaying pushing through a bill that would raise the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen. In a bid to force through this piece of legislation, Stead&rsquo;s articles set about exposing the widespread practice of child prostitution, particularly in London. The analogy with the Minotaur myth, comparing these young girls with Athenian virgins, was a powerful trope, but far more compelling were Stead&rsquo;s investigative journalistic tactics, the most controversial involving the purchase for &pound;5 of a thirteen year-old girl, bought from her own parents.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The articles were instrumental in pushing the bill through, ensuring the age of consent was raised, as well as making it a criminal offence to procure girls for prostitution by the administering of drugs, intimidation or fraud. Not all the reforms were progressive, though. Equating child abuse with other forms of sexual behavior, the new laws also criminalized acts of homosexuality, now punishable with a two-year prison sentence, with or without hard labor. Over the months that followed, however, many cases of child abuse were successfully brought to trial, thanks in no small part to Stead&rsquo;s widely circulated articles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Reading them prompted Watts to take up his brush, &quot;to hold up to detestation the bestial and brutal,&rdquo; as he put it, and paint <em>The Minotaur</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beast</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Viewed obliquely, his neck twisted, his face in <em>profil perdu</em> (the figure is viewed from behind, with the face only partially visible), the Minotaur stands on the ramparts of the Labyrinth, gazing, almost longingly, out to sea. On closer inspection one sees to the left the white sail of the ship bearing the seven fair youths and seven maidens from Athens. It is this that has caught his eye. Gripped by destructive impulses he crushes a small bird in his hand. The sail lies on the orthogonal created by his arm emphasizing the fact that they are heading towards a similar fate as the bird&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Painted with startling rapidity in a single morning, Watts rejects the academic finish of his Victorian counterparts, applying the paint with agitated brushstrokes. The form of the figure is built up with layers of red and yellow creating expressive muscular striations, bringing to mind Turner&rsquo;s incarnadine sunsets or perhaps the industrial processes&mdash;the steelworks and blast furnaces&mdash;that have forged this modern Babylon, London.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The angle of the body rhymes visually with the masonry that constrains it, creating a dynamic interplay of curve and line, of raw animal energy set against the geometric exactitude of Daedalus&rsquo;s structure. The frame, too, constrains the figure, emphasizing the verticality of the composition and suggesting at first glance that he is standing on two legs and not four. We soon realize, though, following the musculature of the neck, the curvature of the back and the modeling of the lower-half of the body that it is a bull-headed, centaur-like creature that we are looking at, the human torso emerging from the bulk of a bull&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Blake&#39;s The Minotaur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"William Blake, The Minotaur (Canto XII), Illustrations to Dante’s Divine Comedy, 1826, watercolor, black ink, graphite and black chalk on paper, 37 x 52 cm, (Fogg Museum, Cambridge, Mass.)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/428577264387fce46cbd6258ebe067fcf957dded.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Blake,<em> The Minotaur (Canto XII)</em>, Illustrations to Dante&rsquo;s <em>Divine Comedy</em>, 1826, watercolor, black ink, graphite and black chalk on paper, 37 x 52 cm&nbsp;(Fogg Museum, Cambridge, Mass.)</span></span>This rather unusual amalgamation of parts can also be found in Blake&rsquo;s 1826 illustration of Dante&#39;s <em>Inferno</em>, where, both bull-headed and quadrupedal, a Minotaur rampant signals Dante and Virgil&rsquo;s descent into the Seventh Circle of Hell.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A more likely visual source, however, given Watts&rsquo;s training as a sculptor, are those famous scenes from the Centauromachy, the battle between the Centaurs and the Lapiths, illustrated on the metopes from the Parthenon, works which profoundly informed his early training as a sculptor.</p>\n"

"<h3>Dream/painting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One way of tackling the problem is to look at the immediate context of its production. As mentioned, the painting&nbsp;was executed swiftly, Watts&#39;s friend Mrs Russell Barrington recording how it was composed early one morning in response to &ldquo;a painful subject&rdquo; that &ldquo;had filled one of the evening papers.&rdquo; The earliness, the urgency and the likelihood that he had read Stead&rsquo;s article the previous evening are all interesting clues, leading one to the possible conclusion that it is not the text that Watts is illustrating, but the dream he had dreamt after reading it.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is certainly a dreamlike quality to the painting, the symbols used all being highly charged with meaning: the sail, the labyrinth, the Minotaur, the crushed bird, the looping tail. If only Freud were around, we may be tempted to say. But then, of course, he was around and in the years following <em>The Minotaur</em>, was busy penning <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> (1900), in which he proposed that the unconscious mind is structured like a language, the mechanisms of which serve to hide from the dreamer their disturbing thoughts. With this in mind, while the symbolism of the dream/painting purports to illustrate Watts&rsquo;s support for Stead&rsquo;s campaign, the visual contradictions of the image seem out of step with the moral certitudes of the articles, allowing a reading of the painting as a sort of dream displacement in which, while borrowing the symbols of Stead, who himself had borrowed them from the ancient Greeks, Watts is actually saying something entirely different and entirely personal. Whatever meanings or interpretations the painting generates are for the individual viewer to construct. The art historian, Andrew Graham-Dixon, suggests this is a characteristic feature of Watts&rsquo;s later works which whether consciously or otherwise anticipate Modernism, giving form to &ldquo;the troubled subjectivity and anxious relativism of a new era.&rdquo;*</p>\n"

"<h3>The Minotaur myth</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>The Minotaur</em> belongs to his later, symbolic works and illustrates a scene from the famous ancient Greek myth.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After her defeat by the Cretans, the story goes, the city of Athens was forced every nine years to send as tribute seven youths and seven maidens. A ship, bearing a black sail, ferried the victims across the Aegean Sea to the land of their subjugators. Once on shore they were sent to the fabled Labyrinth of Daedalus, an impossibly complex maze-like structure, as large as a town. It was here the Minotaur lived; half-human and half-bull, conceived through the preternatural coupling of Pasipha&euml;, the wife of King Minos, and the Cretan Bull.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One by one the beast would pick them off, wandering, half-starved and utterly disorientated, searching desperately for a way out, only to meet their gruesome end with a savage business of goring, pummeling and devouring.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Pablo Picasso, Dying Minotaur, Plate from The Vollard Suite, etching, 1933\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ee99585abffd0c696ebc8c6c3b1e5134737be6ae.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pablo Picasso, <em>Dying Minotaur,</em> Plate from the <em>Vollard Suite</em>, etching, 1933</span></span>A monstrous aberration of nature in western art and literature, the Minotaur came to embody the violent, bestial impulses of man. In the twentieth century however, in Picasso&rsquo;s etchings and the writings of Jorge Luis Borges, for example, the creature has been viewed more sympathetically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Borges, he is a prisoner, painfully unaware of the crime he has committed, who longs for nothing but to be killed. For Picasso, the Minotaur is a tragic figure, dying a pitiful death in his <em>Vollard Suite</em>. For the Victorians, though, the Minotaur was just plain evil, the embodiment of violence and depravity, an association that was dramatically exploited in one of the most effective journalistic campaigns of the nineteenth century.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&rdquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1885 the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> published a series of articles by William Thomas Stead that proved a milestone in the history of modern journalism. At the time Parliament was delaying pushing through a bill that would raise the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen. In a bid to force through this piece of legislation, Stead&rsquo;s articles set about exposing the widespread practice of child prostitution, particularly in London. The analogy with the Minotaur myth, comparing these young girls with Athenian virgins, was a powerful trope, but far more compelling were Stead&rsquo;s investigative journalistic tactics, the most controversial involving the purchase for &pound;5 of a thirteen year-old girl, bought from her own parents.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The articles were instrumental in pushing the bill through, ensuring the age of consent was raised, as well as making it a criminal offence to procure girls for prostitution by the administering of drugs, intimidation or fraud. Not all the reforms were progressive, though. Equating child abuse with other forms of sexual behavior, the new laws also criminalized acts of homosexuality, now punishable with a two-year prison sentence, with or without hard labor. Over the months that followed, however, many cases of child abuse were successfully brought to trial, thanks in no small part to Stead&rsquo;s widely circulated articles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Reading them prompted Watts to take up his brush, &quot;to hold up to detestation the bestial and brutal,&rdquo; as he put it, and paint <em>The Minotaur</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beast</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Viewed obliquely, his neck twisted, his face in <em>profil perdu</em> (the figure is viewed from behind, with the face only partially visible), the Minotaur stands on the ramparts of the Labyrinth, gazing, almost longingly, out to sea. On closer inspection one sees to the left the white sail of the ship bearing the seven fair youths and seven maidens from Athens. It is this that has caught his eye. Gripped by destructive impulses he crushes a small bird in his hand. The sail lies on the orthogonal created by his arm emphasizing the fact that they are heading towards a similar fate as the bird&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Painted with startling rapidity in a single morning, Watts rejects the academic finish of his Victorian counterparts, applying the paint with agitated brushstrokes. The form of the figure is built up with layers of red and yellow creating expressive muscular striations, bringing to mind Turner&rsquo;s incarnadine sunsets or perhaps the industrial processes&mdash;the steelworks and blast furnaces&mdash;that have forged this modern Babylon, London.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The angle of the body rhymes visually with the masonry that constrains it, creating a dynamic interplay of curve and line, of raw animal energy set against the geometric exactitude of Daedalus&rsquo;s structure. The frame, too, constrains the figure, emphasizing the verticality of the composition and suggesting at first glance that he is standing on two legs and not four. We soon realize, though, following the musculature of the neck, the curvature of the back and the modeling of the lower-half of the body that it is a bull-headed, centaur-like creature that we are looking at, the human torso emerging from the bulk of a bull&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Shocked, titillated, and frightened</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Working during the height of the Enlightenment, the so-called &ldquo;Age of Reason,&rdquo; the Swiss-English painter Henry Fuseli (born Johann Heinrich F&uuml;ssli) instead chose to depict darker, irrational forces in his famous painting&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare.</em>&nbsp;In Fuseli&rsquo;s startling composition, a woman bathed in white light stretches across a bed, her arms, neck, and head hanging off the end of the mattress. An apelike figure crouches on her chest while a horse with glowing eyes and flared nostrils emerges from the shadowy background.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting was first displayed at the annual Royal Academy exhibition in London in 1782, where it shocked, titillated, and frightened exhibition visitors and critics. Unlike many of the paintings that were then popular and successful at the Royal Academy exhibitions, Fuseli&rsquo;s <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Nightmare</em>&nbsp;has no moralizing subject. The scene is an invented one, a product of Fuseli&rsquo;s imagination. It certainly has a literary character and the various figures demonstrate Fuseli&rsquo;s broad knowledge of art history, but&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;subject is not drawn from history, the Bible, or literature. The painting&nbsp;has yielded many interpretations and is seen as prefiguring late nineteenth-century psychoanalytic theories regarding dreams and the unconscious&nbsp;(Sigmund Freud allegedly kept a reproduction of the painting on the wall of his apartment in Vienna).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Incubus or&nbsp;mara</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figure that sits upon the woman&rsquo;s chest is often described as an imp or an incubus, a type of spirit said to lie atop people in their sleep or even to have sexual intercourse with sleeping women. Fuseli&rsquo;s painting is suggestive but not explicit, leaving open the possibility that the woman is simply dreaming. Yet, her dream appears to take frightening, physical form in the shapes of the incubus and the horse. According to Fuseli&rsquo;s friend and biographer John Knowles, who saw the first drawing Fuseli made for the composition in 1781, the horse was not present in the drawing but added to the painting later.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Henry Fuseli, The Nightmare (detail), 1781, oil on canvas, 180 × 250 cm (Detroit Institute of Arts)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8a42141a2c1f4466bf81ad3d46f1ec0528456b69.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Incubus (detail),&nbsp;Henry Fuseli, <em>The Nightmare</em>, 1781, oil on canvas, 180 &times; 250 cm (Detroit Institute of Arts</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although it is tempting to understand the painting&rsquo;s title as a punning reference to the horse, the word &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; does not refer to horses. Rather, in the now obsolete definition of the term, a mare is an evil spirit that tortures humans while they sleep. As Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>A Dictionary of the English Language</em>&nbsp;(1755) defined it, a mare or &ldquo;mara, [is] a spirit that, in heathen mythology, was related to torment or to suffocate sleepers. A morbid oppression in the night resembling the pressure of weight upon the breast.&rdquo; Thus, Fuseli&rsquo;s painting may in fact be understood as embodying the physical experience of chest pressure felt during a dream-state.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dark themes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Through his use of composition and chiaroscuro &ndash; the strategic juxtaposition of sharply contrasting light and shadow&mdash;Fuseli heightened the drama and uncertainty of his scene. However, unlike the slightly earlier painting by Joseph Wright of Derby,&nbsp;<em>A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery</em>, which utilized chiaroscuro to symbolize the enlightening power of rational observation, Fuseli&rsquo;s <em>The Nightmare</em>&nbsp;instead shows the futility of light to penetrate or explain the darker realms of the unconscious.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>In <em>The Nightmare</em>, the single light source coming in from the right, the curtains and tassels in the background, and the shortened, stage-like foreground also add to the work&rsquo;s theatricality. The red drapery falling off the edge of the bed even suggests a river of blood as it might be symbolically enacted on stage in a play or an opera, adding morbid undertones to the painting&rsquo;s already dark themes. Throughout his career, Fuseli painted and illustrated scenes from Shakespeare and Milton, and his art has a consistent sense of literary, at times even erudite drama that reveals his classical education (after completing his studies, Fuseli had been ordained as a pastor in the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church before his political activities in Z&uuml;rich effectively forced him into exile in 1761).<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p><em>The&nbsp;Nightmare&rsquo;s&nbsp;</em>stark mixture of horror, sexuality, and morbidity has insured its enduring notoriety. In January 1783,&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare</em>&nbsp;was engraved by Thomas Burke and distributed by the publisher John Raphael Smith. The relatively low price of this reproduction following on the heels of the attention the work received at the Royal Academy helped to distribute the image to a wider audience. Fuseli later painted at least three more variations with the same title and subject.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>The Nightmare</em>&nbsp;became an icon of Romanticism and a defining image of Gothic horror, inspiring the poet Erasmus Darwin (Charles Darwin&rsquo;s grandfather) and the writers Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe among many others. From the start, caricaturists also adopted Fuseli&rsquo;s composition, and political figures from Napoleon Bonaparte to President George W.

A morbid oppression in the night resembling the pressure of weight upon the breast.&rdquo; Thus, Fuseli&rsquo;s painting may in fact be understood as embodying the physical experience of chest pressure felt during a dream-state.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dark themes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Through his use of composition and chiaroscuro &ndash; the strategic juxtaposition of sharply contrasting light and shadow&mdash;Fuseli heightened the drama and uncertainty of his scene. However, unlike the slightly earlier painting by Joseph Wright of Derby,&nbsp;<em>A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery</em>, which utilized chiaroscuro to symbolize the enlightening power of rational observation, Fuseli&rsquo;s <em>The Nightmare</em>&nbsp;instead shows the futility of light to penetrate or explain the darker realms of the unconscious.&nbsp;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1d17c733f10579092256abc13f06fbe4ee09b14f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Joseph Wright of Derby, <em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery (in which a lamp is put in place of the sun)</em>, c. 1763-65, oil on canvas, 4&#39; 10&quot; x 6&#39; 8&quot; (Derby Museums and Art Gallery, Derby)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In <em>The Nightmare</em>, the single light source coming in from the right, the curtains and tassels in the background, and the shortened, stage-like foreground also add to the work&rsquo;s theatricality. The red drapery falling off the edge of the bed even suggests a river of blood as it might be symbolically enacted on stage in a play or an opera, adding morbid undertones to the painting&rsquo;s already dark themes. Throughout his career, Fuseli painted and illustrated scenes from Shakespeare and Milton, and his art has a consistent sense of literary, at times even erudite drama that reveals his classical education (after completing his studies, Fuseli had been ordained as a pastor in the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church before his political activities in Z&uuml;rich effectively forced him into exile in 1761).<br />\n"

"<p><em>The&nbsp;Nightmare&rsquo;s&nbsp;</em>stark mixture of horror, sexuality, and morbidity has insured its enduring notoriety. In January 1783,&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare</em>&nbsp;was engraved by Thomas Burke and distributed by the publisher John Raphael Smith. The relatively low price of this reproduction following on the heels of the attention the work received at the Royal Academy helped to distribute the image to a wider audience. Fuseli later painted at least three more variations with the same title and subject.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>The Nightmare</em>&nbsp;became an icon of Romanticism and a defining image of Gothic horror, inspiring the poet Erasmus Darwin (Charles Darwin&rsquo;s grandfather) and the writers Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe among many others. From the start, caricaturists also adopted Fuseli&rsquo;s composition, and political figures from Napoleon Bonaparte to President George W. Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have all been lampooned in satirical versions of Fuseli&rsquo;s painting.</p>\n"

By 1910, New York produced 70% of women&rsquo;s clothing and 40% of men&rsquo;s ready-made clothing. That meant that the knee-pants and garments made by the workers captured in&nbsp;this Ludlow Street sweatshop were shipped across the nation.

"<h3>The Progressive Era</h3>\n"

"<p>Riis&rsquo; photographs are part of a larger reform effort undertaken during the Progressive Era,&nbsp;that sought to address the problems of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Progressives&nbsp;worked under the premise that if one studies and documents a problem and proposes and tests&nbsp;solutions, difficulties can ultimately be solved, improving the welfare of society as a whole. Progressives&nbsp;like Riis, Lewis Hine, and Jessie Tarbox Beals pioneered the tradition of documentary&nbsp;photography, using the tool to record and publicize working and housing conditions and a&nbsp;renewed call for reform. These efforts ultimately led to government regulation and the passage&nbsp;of the 1901 Tenement House Law, which mandated new construction and sanitation regulations&nbsp;that improved the access to air, light, and water in all tenement buildings.<br />\n"

"<p>They are likely conversing in Yiddish and share&nbsp;some type of familial or neighborly connection. Some of the workers depicted might have lived in a neighboring New&nbsp;York City apartment or next door back in the old country. Home life, family relations and business relations, are intertwined. Just as it is impossible to know the names of the people captured in Riis&rsquo; image, and what Riis actually thought of them, one also cannot know their own&nbsp;impressions of the workplace, or their hopes and day-to-day challenges.</p>\n"

Had sworn certificate he was 16&mdash;owned under cross-examination to being 12. His teeth corresponded with that age</em>,&quot; c. 1890, 7 x 6 inches, from <em>How the Other Half Lives: Studies Among the Tenements of New York</em>, Charles Scribner&#39;s Sons: New York, 1890&nbsp;(<a href=\"http://collections.mcny.org/Explore/Highlights/Jacob%20A.%20Riis/\">The Museum of the City of New York</a>)</span></span>The work performed in tenements like these throughout the Lower East Side made New York&nbsp;City the largest producer of clothing in the United States. Under the contracting system, the&nbsp;tenement shop would be responsible for assembling the garments, which made up the bulk&nbsp;of the work. By 1910, New York produced 70% of women&rsquo;s clothing and 40% of men&rsquo;s ready-made clothing. That meant that the knee-pants and garments made by the workers captured in&nbsp;this Ludlow Street sweatshop were shipped across the nation. Riis&rsquo; photographs&nbsp;helped make the sweatshop a subject of a national debate and the center of a struggle between&nbsp;workers, owners, consumers, politicians, and social reformers.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Progressive Era</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Riis&rsquo; photographs are part of a larger reform effort undertaken during the Progressive Era,&nbsp;that sought to address the problems of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Progressives&nbsp;worked under the premise that if one studies and documents a problem and proposes and tests&nbsp;solutions, difficulties can ultimately be solved, improving the welfare of society as a whole. Progressives&nbsp;like Riis, Lewis Hine, and Jessie Tarbox Beals pioneered the tradition of documentary&nbsp;photography, using the tool to record and publicize working and housing conditions and a&nbsp;renewed call for reform. These efforts ultimately led to government regulation and the passage&nbsp;of the 1901 Tenement House Law, which mandated new construction and sanitation regulations&nbsp;that improved the access to air, light, and water in all tenement buildings.<br />\n"

"<h3>Neolithic Liangzhu culture</h3>\n"

"<p>A group of Neolithic peoples grouped today as the Liangzhu culture lived in the Jiangsu province of China during the third millennium B.C.E. Their jades, ceramics and stone tools were highly sophisticated.</p>\n"

"<p>Stone rings were being made by the peoples of eastern China as early as the fifth millennium B.C.E. Jade discs have been found carefully laid on the bodies of the dead in tombs of the Hongshan culture (about 3800-2700 B.C.E.), a practice which was continued by later Neolithic cultures. Large and heavy jade discs such as this example, appear to have been an innovation of the Liangzhu culture (about 3000-2000 B.C.E.), although they are not found in all major Liangzhu tombs. The term bi is applied to wide discs with proportionately small central holes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most finely carved discs or bi of the best stone (like the example above) were placed in prominent positions, often near the stomach and the chest of the deceased. Other bi were aligned with the body.

"\n"
"<p>We do not know what the true significance of these discs was, but they must have had an important ritual function as part of the burial. This is an exceptionally fine example, with the two faces very highly polished.</p>\n"

"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/491f7dd71b76ea2b3ed7dc60e3f7eface23bf0a7.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing</em>, From Pictorial Cycle of Eight Poetic Subjects, mid 18th century, oil on canvas, 91.4 x 88.9 cm, Shiraz, Iran (Brooklyn Museum)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>On the bank of a cool spring in a lush meadow, a beautiful princess swoons at the sight of a young prince who has stumbled upon her bathing. To an eighteenth century audience, the pair would have been immediately recognizable as Shirin and Khusraw, two of the most famous lovers in the history of Persian literature. Although rendered in oils with a palette indebted to the European&nbsp;Renaissance, the canvas immediately betrays its Islamic origin in its carefully rounded top&mdash;it was&nbsp;designed to fit into the window-shaped niches common in Persian architecture of the period. Putatively titled <em>Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing</em>, the work emerges from a cycle of eight paintings that share a similar style and scale, depicting scenes of hunt as well as events drawn from biblical, Qur&rsquo;anic, and poetic narratives.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>For the love of images</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The content of the painting derives from Nizami&rsquo;s <em>Khamsa</em>, an immensely popular quintet of poems compiled in the thirteenth century. Of the stories recounted, the tale of the love shared between Shirin, a Lebanese princess, and Khusraw, a Sasanian prince, was most celebrated for its romantic appeal and poetic rendering. Nizami&rsquo;s telling of the story emphasizes the power of words and images to inflame the passions of the two lovers. The story is set in motion when Khusraw, aroused by the vivid description of Shirin&rsquo;s beauty by his court painter, Shapur, sends the artist off to lure the princess into his kingdom.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Upon arriving in Lebanon, Shapur baits the princess by planting paintings of Khusraw in her path over the course of three days. At first Shirin&rsquo;s handmaidens destroy Khusraw&rsquo;s image and burn rue (an herb) to break the painting&rsquo;s spell. However, on the third day, Shirin falls in love with the man in the painting and learns of his identity from Shapur. A tremendously popular subject for illustration, Shirin&rsquo;s enchantment by the image of Khusraw underscores the esteemed position held by figural imagery in Persian culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Setting the seen</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Heart aflutter and with the aid of Shabdiz, her aunt&rsquo;s famously fast horse, Shirin abandons her companions at the next day&rsquo;s hunt and departs for Persia. Meanwhile, because of conspiring adversaries, Khusraw is forced to flee his palace in disguise and sets a course for Armenia to find Shirin.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What follows is Nizami&rsquo;s account of the fated meeting of the lovers depicted in the present painting:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>For fourteen days and fourteen nights she [Shirin] traveled. Then she came upon an emerald field in which there gleamed a gentle pool&hellip; When she had satisfied herself that she was quite alone, she tethered Shabdiz and prepared to bathe. Beautiful was the whiteness of her skin against the blueness of the water. She loosed her braids and washed her long black hair, and the moon-like reflection of her face was caught in the shallows of the pool (Chelkowski, 25).</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Khusraw&rsquo;s rapid departure from his palace brings him into the vicinity of the princess.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>[H]e ordered his attendants to feed their horses while he rode on alone. Suddenly, he came upon the pool in the emerald field and saw Shirin sitting in the water like a lily. At the sight of her his heart caught fire and burned; he trembled with desire in every limb. Softly he rode toward her and whispered to himself how he would like to have such a beautiful maiden and such a black horse as hers&hellip;Suddenly, Shirin looked up. Startled, she gathered her black hair about her like a cloak, emerged from the pool, dressed, and mounted her horse. At the touch of her heel, Shabdiz carried her off into the shadows of the late afternoon (Chelkowski, 26).</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Narrative infidelities</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beyond the inclusion of Khusraw in the vicinity of the bathing Shirin, very little of the painting corresponds to Nizami&rsquo;s telling of the event. Khusraw appears in royal attire, undisguised, while the queen&rsquo;s famous black horse is rendered in silver and brown. &nbsp;While these minor contradictions to the text perpetuate errors&nbsp;common in earlier miniatures, the &nbsp;addition of three extraneous figures &nbsp;complicates a story that hinges upon the intimacy established by the isolation of the characters from their retinue.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Shirin and her attendant appear to notice Khusraw&rsquo;s approach before he sets his sight on the princess. Both women look up toward the prince, guiding the viewer&rsquo;s attention toward his presence in the center of the canvas. Khusraw and his companion appear unaware of the princess and her attendant. Khusraw, gesturing to his face and looking to the sky, appears in a state of distracted reverie. A contrary reading of the painting might interpret the rosy cheeks of Khusraw and his partner as indicating their awareness of the bathing Shirin. Khusraw&rsquo;s gesture transforms into the coy reaction of a voyeur who has been caught looking.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Blending traditions</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Persian painting prior to the introduction of European oil on canvas techniques survive primarily&nbsp;as wall murals or as manuscript miniatures. Consequently, the aesthetic appreciation of a painted narrative was either extremely intimate or communally shared. Easel painting, the dominant mode operating in Europe in the 18th century, offered a productive middle ground. Painting on canvas permitted greater flexibility in size and portability while loosening the physical connection of images to textual description.</p>\n"

Nevertheless, the absence of perspectival space and subsequent flattening of figures in the painting are indebted to the Persian manuscript tradition. The artist&rsquo;s contact with European art was likely one of technical innovation rather than pictorial convention. Such superficial integration of foreign aesthetics by Persian artists is characteristic of a broader, global blending of regional styles due to increased trade contacts and political conflict during this period. It would not be until the early nineteenth century that Persian painters were sent to Europe to be trained in this mode.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The installation of arch-topped canvases within architectural niches extended the tradition of mural painting on walls of palaces into a broader social sphere. Historical records confirm that earlier mural paintings depicting scenes from Nizami&rsquo;s poetry were supplemented by panels of explanatory text. Such an addition would certainly temper the artistic liberties taken by the painting&rsquo;s creator.&nbsp;The subjects depicted in the cycle from which the present painting comes suggest that the paintings were hung in a room used for entertaining guests either in a home or pavilion. Here, the paintings would serve to stimulate conversation among educated visitors.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>On the bank of a cool spring in a lush meadow, a beautiful princess swoons at the sight of a young prince who has stumbled upon her bathing. To an eighteenth century audience, the pair would have been immediately recognizable as Shirin and Khusraw, two of the most famous lovers in the history of Persian literature. Although rendered in oils with a palette indebted to the European&nbsp;Renaissance, the canvas immediately betrays its Islamic origin in its carefully rounded top&mdash;it was&nbsp;designed to fit into the window-shaped niches common in Persian architecture of the period. Putatively titled <em>Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing</em>, the work emerges from a cycle of eight paintings that share a similar style and scale, depicting scenes of hunt as well as events drawn from biblical, Qur&rsquo;anic, and poetic narratives.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>For the love of images</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The content of the painting derives from Nizami&rsquo;s <em>Khamsa</em>, an immensely popular quintet of poems compiled in the thirteenth century. Of the stories recounted, the tale of the love shared between Shirin, a Lebanese princess, and Khusraw, a Sasanian prince, was most celebrated for its romantic appeal and poetic rendering. Nizami&rsquo;s telling of the story emphasizes the power of words and images to inflame the passions of the two lovers. The story is set in motion when Khusraw, aroused by the vivid description of Shirin&rsquo;s beauty by his court painter, Shapur, sends the artist off to lure the princess into his kingdom.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Upon arriving in Lebanon, Shapur baits the princess by planting paintings of Khusraw in her path over the course of three days. At first Shirin&rsquo;s handmaidens destroy Khusraw&rsquo;s image and burn rue (an herb) to break the painting&rsquo;s spell. However, on the third day, Shirin falls in love with the man in the painting and learns of his identity from Shapur. A tremendously popular subject for illustration, Shirin&rsquo;s enchantment by the image of Khusraw underscores the esteemed position held by figural imagery in Persian culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Setting the seen</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Heart aflutter and with the aid of Shabdiz, her aunt&rsquo;s famously fast horse, Shirin abandons her companions at the next day&rsquo;s hunt and departs for Persia. Meanwhile, because of conspiring adversaries, Khusraw is forced to flee his palace in disguise and sets a course for Armenia to find Shirin.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What follows is Nizami&rsquo;s account of the fated meeting of the lovers depicted in the present painting:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>For fourteen days and fourteen nights she [Shirin] traveled. Then she came upon an emerald field in which there gleamed a gentle pool&hellip; When she had satisfied herself that she was quite alone, she tethered Shabdiz and prepared to bathe. Beautiful was the whiteness of her skin against the blueness of the water. She loosed her braids and washed her long black hair, and the moon-like reflection of her face was caught in the shallows of the pool (Chelkowski, 25).</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Khusraw&rsquo;s rapid departure from his palace brings him into the vicinity of the princess.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>[H]e ordered his attendants to feed their horses while he rode on alone. Suddenly, he came upon the pool in the emerald field and saw Shirin sitting in the water like a lily. At the sight of her his heart caught fire and burned; he trembled with desire in every limb. Softly he rode toward her and whispered to himself how he would like to have such a beautiful maiden and such a black horse as hers&hellip;Suddenly, Shirin looked up. Startled, she gathered her black hair about her like a cloak, emerged from the pool, dressed, and mounted her horse. At the touch of her heel, Shabdiz carried her off into the shadows of the late afternoon (Chelkowski, 26).</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Narrative infidelities</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beyond the inclusion of Khusraw in the vicinity of the bathing Shirin, very little of the painting corresponds to Nizami&rsquo;s telling of the event. Khusraw appears in royal attire, undisguised, while the queen&rsquo;s famous black horse is rendered in silver and brown. &nbsp;While these minor contradictions to the text perpetuate errors&nbsp;common in earlier miniatures, the &nbsp;addition of three extraneous figures &nbsp;complicates a story that hinges upon the intimacy established by the isolation of the characters from their retinue.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Shirin and her attendant appear to notice Khusraw&rsquo;s approach before he sets his sight on the princess. Both women look up toward the prince, guiding the viewer&rsquo;s attention toward his presence in the center of the canvas. Khusraw and his companion appear unaware of the princess and her attendant. Khusraw, gesturing to his face and looking to the sky, appears in a state of distracted reverie. A contrary reading of the painting might interpret the rosy cheeks of Khusraw and his partner as indicating their awareness of the bathing Shirin. Khusraw&rsquo;s gesture transforms into the coy reaction of a voyeur who has been caught looking.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Blending traditions</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Persian painting prior to the introduction of European oil on canvas techniques survive primarily&nbsp;as wall murals or as manuscript miniatures. Consequently, the aesthetic appreciation of a painted narrative was either extremely intimate or communally shared. Easel painting, the dominant mode operating in Europe in the 18th century, offered a productive middle ground. Painting on canvas permitted greater flexibility in size and portability while loosening the physical connection of images to textual description.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\" \n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bf1a5d36f1e500685c1748da7fd7381081c19c9b.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Shaikh Zada, <em>Khusrau Catches Sight of Shirin Bathing</em>, Folio from a Khamsa (Quintet) of Nizami, c. 1524-25, ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper, page: 32.1 x 22.2 cm (Metropolitan Museum of Art) </span></span>The muted palette and chiaroscuro used by the painter of <em>Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing</em> shows the influence of European conventions. Nevertheless, the absence of perspectival space and subsequent flattening of figures in the painting are indebted to the Persian manuscript tradition. The artist&rsquo;s contact with European art was likely one of technical innovation rather than pictorial convention. Such superficial integration of foreign aesthetics by Persian artists is characteristic of a broader, global blending of regional styles due to increased trade contacts and political conflict during this period. It would not be until the early nineteenth century that Persian painters were sent to Europe to be trained in this mode.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The installation of arch-topped canvases within architectural niches extended the tradition of mural painting on walls of palaces into a broader social sphere. Historical records confirm that earlier mural paintings depicting scenes from Nizami&rsquo;s poetry were supplemented by panels of explanatory text. Such an addition would certainly temper the artistic liberties taken by the painting&rsquo;s creator.&nbsp;The subjects depicted in the cycle from which the present painting comes suggest that the paintings were hung in a room used for entertaining guests either in a home or pavilion. Here, the paintings would serve to stimulate conversation among educated visitors.</p>\n"

So, here Masaccio imagines God as a man. Not a force or a power, or something abstract, but as a man. A man who stands -- his feet are foreshortened, and he weighs something and is capable of walking! In medieval art, God was often represented by a hand, just a hand, as though God was an abstract force or power in our lives, but here he seems so much like a flesh and blood man. This is a good indication of Humanism in the Renaissance.</p>\n"

"<p>Worship and power struggles, enlightenment and suicide&mdash;the 2300 caves and niches filled with Buddhist art at&nbsp;Longmen in China has witnessed it all.

"\n"
"<p>In the images of&nbsp;arhats (worthy monks who have advanced very far in their quest of Enlightenment),&nbsp;who line the walls,&nbsp;the carver sought to create intense realism. Although they are still mortal, arhats&nbsp;are capable of extraordinary deeds both physical and spiritual (they can move at free will through space, can understand the thoughts in people&#39;s minds, and hear the voices of far away speakers). Twenty-nine monks form a procession around the cave perimeter, linking the subject matter to the rising interest in Chan Buddhism (the Meditation School) fostered at court by the empress herself. These&nbsp;portraits record&nbsp;the lineage of the great patriarchs who transmitted the Buddhist doctrine.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Sovereignty and iconography</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Foreign rulers of the Northern Wei, yearning for assimilation and control, made use of Buddhist images for authority and power. Tang dynasty leaders thrived during China&rsquo;s golden age, asserting their sovereignty with the assistance of Buddhist iconography. Today you can visit the stunning limestone remains in Luoyang, New York City, and Kansas City.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Imperial Patronage</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Worship and power struggles, enlightenment and suicide&mdash;the 2300 caves and niches filled with Buddhist art at&nbsp;Longmen in China has witnessed it all. The&nbsp;steep limestone cliffs extend for almost a mile and contain approximately 110,000 Buddhist stone statues, 60 stupas (hemispherical structures containing Buddhist relics) and 2,800 inscriptions carved on steles (vertical stone markers).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Buddhism, born in India, was transmitted to China intermittently and haphazardly. Starting as early as the 1st century C.E., Buddhism brought to China new images, texts, ideas about&nbsp;life and death, and new opportunities to assert authority. The Longmen cave-temple complex, located on both sides of the Yi River (south of the ancient capital of Luoyang), is an excellent site for understanding how rulers wielded this foreign religion to affirm assimilation and superiority.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Wei dynasty was founded by Tuoba tribesmen (nomads from the frontiers of northern China) who&nbsp;were considered to be barbaric foreigners by the Han Chinese. Northern Wei Emperor Xiao Wen decided to move the capital south to Luoyang in 494 C.E., a region considered the cradle of Chinese civilization. Many of the Tuoba elite opposed the move and disapproved of Xiao Wen&rsquo;s eager adoption of Chinese culture. Even his own son disapproved and was forced to end his own life. At first, Emperor Xiao Wen and rich citizens focused&nbsp;on building the city&rsquo;s administrative and court quarters&mdash;only later did they shift their energies and wealth into the construction of monasteries and temples. With all the efforts expended on the city, the court barely managed to complete one cave temple at Longmen&mdash;the Central Binyang Cave.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In the images of&nbsp;arhats (worthy monks who have advanced very far in their quest of Enlightenment),&nbsp;who line the walls,&nbsp;the carver sought to create intense realism. Although they are still mortal, arhats&nbsp;are capable of extraordinary deeds both physical and spiritual (they can move at free will through space, can understand the thoughts in people&#39;s minds, and hear the voices of far away speakers). Twenty-nine monks form a procession around the cave perimeter, linking the subject matter to the rising interest in Chan Buddhism (the Meditation School) fostered at court by the empress herself. These&nbsp;portraits record&nbsp;the lineage of the great patriarchs who transmitted the Buddhist doctrine.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Sovereignty and iconography</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Foreign rulers of the Northern Wei, yearning for assimilation and control, made use of Buddhist images for authority and power. Tang dynasty leaders thrived during China&rsquo;s golden age, asserting their sovereignty with the assistance of Buddhist iconography. Today you can visit the stunning limestone remains in Luoyang, New York City, and Kansas City.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>As the viewer, we are placed at a slight leftward angle from the woman in the chair so that we see her through her reflection in the mirror while she is looking away from it. The downward gaze ia&nbsp;similar to that of the model in the Utamaro, is done partly in homage to the modesty of the female subject in the <em>ukiyo-e</em> prints (artists were always aware that their works were made for a male-dominated market and designed them to be enticing) and partly as a study of shape and line,&nbsp;so that the viewer, realizing that he or she is not looking at a psychological portrait, could focus more intently on the compositional elements of the work.&nbsp;The prints provided artists with an opportunity to showcase their skill in concision&mdash;using no more than is necessary to convey an idea&mdash;the way a haiku poet showcases similar skill within the three lines and seventeen syllables of the poem</p>\n"

"<p>The curve of the woman&rsquo;s sloping back and neck echoes the curves of the chair which stand in contrast to the vertical lines of the mirror&mdash;a compositional counterpoint that further enhances the tension within the tight composition. The limited color palette of shades of rose, brown, and white, enables us to focus&nbsp;closely on the form and clarity of line. It also mimics the quality of pastels, which Cassatt, like her friend Edgar Degas, often liked to use. Through the process of the drypoint and aquatint etching, <em>La Coiffure</em> combines Cassatt&rsquo;s propensity for hazy shading and soft tones with a bold sharpness in line allowing the artist to integrate the qualities of two disparate media.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Her desire to emulate the haziness, sensual, and&nbsp;suggestive possibilities of pastels is what motivated Cassatt not to use woodblock printing but intaglio. First, Cassatt carved her designs onto a smooth copper plate with a fine metal needle.&nbsp;Then the plate would be dusted with a powdered resin and heated until the resin melted in tiny mounds that hardened as they cooled. Acid was then added on to the metal plate biting the channels along the resin droplets. The deeper penetration of acid produced richer, darker tones, while a lighter application of acid produced lighter shades of color and a variety of nuanced gradients could be generated within a single print. Once Cassatt had replicated a certain number of images from a plate, she would incise the plate with a needle so that no one could use the same image again.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Cassatt was inspired in part by some of Degas&rsquo; pastels of women grooming. In Cassatt&rsquo;s prints, the time-honored boudoir scenes we see in Titian and Bellini become de-eroticized and re-appropriated as skilled exercises in form, shading, and line. In the spirit of <em>ukiyo-e</em> and Impressionism, these prints capture fugitive, fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Cassatt&rsquo;s motivation in making the prints was to make her art more accessible for a large audience. She believed that everyone, regardless of income or social position, should be able to experience art and to own works they enjoy:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>I believe [nothing] will inspire a taste for art more than the possibility of having it in the home. I should like to feel that amateurs in America could have an example of my work, a print or an etching, for a few dollars. That is what they do in France. It is not left to the rich alone to buy art; the people&mdash;even the poor&mdash;have taste and buy according to their means, and here they can always find something they can afford. [2]</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This philosophy of art for the masses wasn&rsquo;t always popular with Mary Cassatt&rsquo;s contemporaries, like John Singer Sargent and the art historian Vernon Lee (Violet Paget), who viewed Cassatt&rsquo;s printmaking as a dilution of her precious talent. Yet Cassatt understood that as the world was changing with the twentieth century&rsquo;s new industries and technology, more and more people would have the income, education, and ability to experience art in ways they hadn&rsquo;t been able to before.&nbsp;The proliferative possibilities of the print and its evocative potential to convey so much in such a small space was just the art form to reach a wider&nbsp;audience.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Through the process of the drypoint and aquatint etching, <em>La Coiffure</em> combines Cassatt&rsquo;s propensity for hazy shading and soft tones with a bold sharpness in line allowing the artist to integrate the qualities of two disparate media.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Her desire to emulate the haziness, sensual, and&nbsp;suggestive possibilities of pastels is what motivated Cassatt not to use woodblock printing but intaglio. First, Cassatt carved her designs onto a smooth copper plate with a fine metal needle.&nbsp;Then the plate would be dusted with a powdered resin and heated until the resin melted in tiny mounds that hardened as they cooled. Acid was then added on to the metal plate biting the channels along the resin droplets. The deeper penetration of acid produced richer, darker tones, while a lighter application of acid produced lighter shades of color and a variety of nuanced gradients could be generated within a single print. Once Cassatt had replicated a certain number of images from a plate, she would incise the plate with a needle so that no one could use the same image again.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Cassatt was inspired in part by some of Degas&rsquo; pastels of women grooming. In Cassatt&rsquo;s prints, the time-honored boudoir scenes we see in Titian and Bellini become de-eroticized and re-appropriated as skilled exercises in form, shading, and line. In the spirit of <em>ukiyo-e</em> and Impressionism, these prints capture fugitive, fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Cassatt&rsquo;s motivation in making the prints was to make her art more accessible for a large audience. She believed that everyone, regardless of income or social position, should be able to experience art and to own works they enjoy:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>I believe [nothing] will inspire a taste for art more than the possibility of having it in the home. I should like to feel that amateurs in America could have an example of my work, a print or an etching, for a few dollars. That is what they do in France. It is not left to the rich alone to buy art; the people&mdash;even the poor&mdash;have taste and buy according to their means, and here they can always find something they can afford. [2]</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This philosophy of art for the masses wasn&rsquo;t always popular with Mary Cassatt&rsquo;s contemporaries, like John Singer Sargent and the art historian Vernon Lee (Violet Paget), who viewed Cassatt&rsquo;s printmaking as a dilution of her precious talent. Yet Cassatt understood that as the world was changing with the twentieth century&rsquo;s new industries and technology, more and more people would have the income, education, and ability to experience art in ways they hadn&rsquo;t been able to before.&nbsp;The proliferative possibilities of the print and its evocative potential to convey so much in such a small space was just the art form to reach a wider&nbsp;audience.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>A Luncheon with Fur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The story behind the creation of <em>Object</em>, an ordinary cup, spoon, and saucer wrapped evocatively in gazelle fur, has been told so many times its importance in modernist history transcends the fact it might be apocryphal (of dubious authenticity). The twenty-two year old Basel-born artist, Meret Oppenheim, had been in Paris for four years when, one day, she was at a caf&eacute; with Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar. Oppenheim was wearing a brass bracelet covered in fur when Picasso and Maar, who were admiring it, proclaimed, &ldquo;Almost anything can be covered in fur!&rdquo; As Oppenheim&rsquo;s tea grew cold, she jokingly asked the waiter for &ldquo;more fur.&rdquo; Inspiration struck&mdash;Oppenheim is said to have gone straight from the caf&eacute; to a store where she purchased the cup, saucer, and spoon used in this piece. This amusing story belies the importance of Object and the critical acclaim and public fascination that has elevated it to point where it has become the definitive surrealist object...ultimately to Oppenheim&rsquo;s dismay.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What Is a Surrealist Object?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Oppenheim&rsquo;s <em>Object</em> was created at a moment when sculpted objects and assemblages had become prominent features of Surrealist art practice. In 1937, British art critic Herbert Read emphasized that all Surrealist objects were representative of an idea and Salvador Dal&iacute; described some of them as &ldquo;objects with symbolic function.&rdquo; In other words, how might an otherwise typical, functional object be modified so it represents something deeply personal and poetic? How might it, in Freudian terms, resonate as a sublimation of internal desire and aspiration? Such physical manifestations of our internal psyches were indicative of a <em>surreality</em>, or the point in which external and internal realities united, as described by Andr&eacute; Breton (one of Surrealism&rsquo;s founders and theorists) in his first <em>Manifesto of Surrealism</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Visceral Responses</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What, then, do we make of this set of be-furred tableware? Interpretations vary wildly. The art historian Whitney Chadwick has described it as linked to the Surrealist&rsquo;s love of alchemical transformation by turning cool, smooth ceramic and metal into something warm and bristley, while many scholars have noted the fetishistic qualities of the fur-lined set&mdash;as the fur imbues these functional, hand-held objects with sexual connotations. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In a 1936 issue of the <em>New Yorker Magazine</em>, it was reported that a woman fainted &ldquo;right in front of the fur-bearing cup and saucer [while it was on exhibit at MoMA]. &ldquo;She left no name with the attendants who revived her - only a vague feeling of apprehension.&rdquo;* Such visceral reactions to Oppenheim&rsquo;s sculpture come closest, perhaps, to what were likely the artist&rsquo;s aspirations. In an interview later in life, Oppenheim described her creations as &ldquo;not an illustration of an idea, but the thing itself.&rdquo;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Unlike Read and Dal&iacute;, Oppenheim stresses the physicality of <em>Object</em>, reinforcing the way we can readily imagine the feeling of the fur while drinking from the cup, and using the saucer and spoon. The frisson we experience when china is unexpectedly wrapped in fur is based on our familiarity with both, and the fur requires us to extend our sensory experiences to fully appreciate the work. <em>Object</em> insists we imagine what sipping warm tea from this cup feels like, how the bristles would feel upon our lips. &nbsp;With Oppenheim&rsquo;s elegant creation, how we understand those visceral memories, how we create metaphors and symbols out of this act of tactile extension, is entirely open to interpretation by each individual, which is, in many ways, the whole point of Surrealism itself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Presentation Problems</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In spite of our individual response, the interpretation of <em>Object</em> has been complicated by the ways it was assigned meaning by others. When <em>Object</em> was finished, Oppenheim submitted it to Breton for an exhibition of Surrealist objects at the Charles Ratton Gallery in Paris in 1936. &nbsp;However, while Oppenheim preferred a non-descriptive title, Breton took the liberty of titling the piece <em>Le D&eacute;jeneur en fourrure</em>, or <em>Luncheon in Fur</em>. &nbsp;This title is a play on two nineteenth-century works: &Eacute;douard Manet&rsquo;s infamous modernist painting <em>Luncheon on the Grass (Le D&eacute;jeneur sur l&rsquo;herbe)</em> and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch&rsquo;s erotic novel <em>Venus in Furs</em>. With these two references, Breton forces an explicit sexualized meaning onto <em>Object</em>. Recall that the original inspiration for this work was implicitly practical: when Oppenheim asked the waiter for more fur for her cooling teacup, it was suggested as a way to keep her tea warm, and not necessarily as overtly sexual.<br />\n"

The title and&nbsp;laced shoes together suggest the potential act of undressing and a fascination with exposing the female body. However, when Oppenheim later described <em>Das Paar</em> (with the laces untied), she stated it was an &ldquo;odd unisexual pair: two shoes, unobserved at night, doing &lsquo;forbidden&rsquo; things.&rdquo; She expressly assigned no gender, and suggests the &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; acts already taking place between anthropomorphized shoes. She takes a more literal approach, the shoes as expressive things in themselves, rather than symbolically resonant of something else.</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Dangerous Success</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Yet, the early acclaim for the fur-covered <em>Object</em> had a negative effect on Oppenheim&rsquo;s early career. &nbsp;When it was purchased by The Museum of Modern Art and featured in their influential 1936-37 exhibition &quot;Fantastic Art, Dada, and Surrealism&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;visitors &nbsp;declared it the &ldquo;quintessential&rdquo; Surrealist object.

It was only later when she re-emerged, and began publicly showing new paintings and objects with renewed vigor and confidence, that she began reclaiming some of the intent of her work. When she was given an award for her work by the City of Basel, she touched upon this in her acceptance speech: &ldquo;I think it is the duty of a woman to lead a life that expresses her disbelief in the validity of the taboos that have been imposed upon her kind for thousands of years.

Other European nations followed throughout the 19th century. National communities distanced themselves from old forms of Christianity, and they tolerated Jews, albeit with reservations.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Hung in well-appointed parlors....they...provided a connection to Jewish heritage by linking the world of cosmopolitan Vienna to a traditional lifestyle that endured outside the capital.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/man-with-fur-hat/ZAHnngZnzTGp6A?projectId=art-project\">Source</a></span></span>But there was another answer to the paradox posed by modernity.&nbsp;Inspired by Mendelssohn, Jewish questioners throughout German-speaking lands in the early nineteenth century developed the Reform movement.&nbsp;These reformers believed that their mission was to bring Judaism in line with modern thought; they also promoted the idea that prayers should be chanted in the local language rather than in Hebrew.&nbsp;They encouraged rabbis to look beyond the Talmud and Torah for guidance. Reformers spurned the idea that the past could dictate a way of life in an increasingly secular and&nbsp;industrial&nbsp;context.&nbsp;They modeled many of their religious practices after German Christians&nbsp;encouraging&nbsp;&ldquo;decorum&rdquo; in synagogue, introducing&nbsp;music similar to that heard in churches, and many even wanted to switch the Sabbath to Sunday. They wanted to remain Jews, while highlighting Judaism&rsquo;s similarities with Christianity.</p>\n"

"<h3>Orthodox movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These efforts infuriated traditionalists, who then reacted with steadfast conservatism.&nbsp; Some traditional rabbis had long opposed emancipation, but in response to the Reformers, a group of adherents to <em>Halakhah </em>codified the new Orthodox movement.&nbsp;They opposed many of the secular cultural forms that Judaism took in the coming decades: the Yiddishist movement, Zionism, and any other divergences from strict Halakhah. Some insisted that established customs not grounded in Jewish law should take on the weight of <em>Halakhah</em>&mdash;this is why some groups continue to dress and speak like their ancestors from a century ago or more.&nbsp; These extreme forms of observance are as much a product of modernity as Reform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Hasidic Judaism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Eastern Europe, another religious movement, called Hasidism, gained traction parallel to Reform and Orthodoxy.&nbsp;Founded in the eighteenth century by a rabbi and mystic who called himself Israel Baal Shem Tov, Hasidic Judaism grew out of a populist reaction to the elitism of the traditional Talmudic academy. Hasidic Judaism focuses on mystical interpretations of holy texts and the potential for uneducated Jews to experience holiness. The movement spread rapidly across Eastern and Central Europe. Hasidism&nbsp;gave rise to opposition from at least two sides: the traditional rabbinic legal structures that revolved around organized Torah study, and the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; Jews intent on both escaping the oppressive framework of the traditional Jewish family and acculturating into European society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In spite of Hasidic Judaism&rsquo;s strained history with what came to be known as Orthodoxy, it has become harder to distinguish stringent Orthodox Jews from their Hasidic counterparts. As Reform Judaism gained popularity, the two groups joined forces in support of Halakhah and in opposition to radical reform. Known for their distinctive dress (beards, fur hats, sidelocks, and caftans for men), Hasidim are among the most visible Jewish groups.</p>\n"

From Russia to Damascus, and Danzig to Algiers, Jews were attacked as infiltrators and blamed for a wide range of&nbsp;social and economic problems.&nbsp;Accusations and rumors led to riots and <em>pogroms</em> (a&nbsp;Russian word that means&nbsp;to violently destroy,&nbsp;used to describe the riots&nbsp;in Eastern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries&nbsp;that resulted&nbsp;in the rape and&nbsp;murder of Jews and the theft and&nbsp;destruction of their property).</p>\n"

"<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Zionism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Several events from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries proved that Jews were not welcomed as equals. In Russia, violent pogroms and economic instability pushed over two million people to emigrate&nbsp;in the 1880s. The vast majority fled to North America, and a small fraction of pioneers traveled to Palestine, the site of ancient Judaism&rsquo;s origins. Some Jewish leaders, responding to the growing nationalism and antisemitism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, followed Theodor Herzl&nbsp;who advocated for a type of&nbsp;secular Jewish nationalism, a return to the biblical homeland of the Jewish people.&nbsp;Religious Jews had prayed facing Jerusalem and called for a Messianic return to the Land of Israel since the Second Temple was destroyed. But the modern political movement, known as Zionism, united the religious impulse to &ldquo;return&rdquo; with&nbsp;secular ideas about constructing a European-style nation for Jews.&nbsp;It is important to note that Zionism was but one form of Jewish nationalism that took hold in the nineteenth century. Some Jews fought for territorial and political autonomy on different parts of the globe, others fought for cultural autonomy in the nations where they lived. These Diaspora nationalist movements mostly disappeared in 1948 when Israel became an&nbsp;independent state.</p>\n"

"<h3>Holocaust</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;The antisemite creates the Jew,&rdquo; wrote the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; Antisemitism had generated a false image of what a Jew is, making Jews seem like a social danger for the majority of Europeans. After World War I, liberal democracies everywhere appeared to be failing.&nbsp;The idea that Jews were responsible for social and economic crises convinced many&nbsp;to use race and ethnicity as a test to determine who&nbsp;belonged and who&nbsp;ought to be excluded.&nbsp;It was in this climate that the Nazi party was elected to power in 1933.&nbsp;Combining their expansionist vision with&nbsp;spurious theories of racial purity, the Germans quickly came to control most of central and eastern Europe.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Genocide became an everyday phenomenon&mdash;the Nuremburg Laws forced Jews to identify themselves with a badge, and criminalized sexual intimacy between Jews and gentiles. Laws were passed across Europe and the Mediterranean that excluded Jews from certain professions and the right to attend school.&nbsp;Citizenship was revoked and many people were&nbsp;forced&nbsp;from their homes into overcrowded wards.&nbsp;Inspired by the medieval ghetto, the Nazis went further&mdash;killing Jews by restricting food and medicine, packing thousands into spaces fit for far fewer, and, eventually, forbidding Jews to leave at all. Working in collaboration with governments across Europe, Nazi officials enacted a &ldquo;Final Solution&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Jewish Question&rdquo; in early 1942.&nbsp;Jews were forcibly&nbsp;gathered and shipped to local concentration camps and to death camps in Poland and Russia.&nbsp;Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.<br />\n"

"<p>The emancipation of European&nbsp;Jews from ghettos became a benchmark of sorts indicating&nbsp;a nation&rsquo;s transformation from the medieval to the modern.&nbsp;Upon the formation of a secular nation, French Jews received civil rights in 1791 and 1792. Other European nations followed throughout the 19th century. National communities distanced themselves from old forms of Christianity, and they tolerated Jews, albeit with reservations.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish enlightenment (<em>Haskalah</em>)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Germany, which did not become a&nbsp;unified nation until 1871, Jews were not granted full equality. Rights depended on local municipalities and in some places, Jews were awarded rights only to have them taken away soon after. It is no coincidence that Germany was the birthplace of Reform Judaism.&nbsp;Progressive thinkers sought to transform Judaism from within when they could not stem prejudice against Jews from without.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Moses Mendelssohn &nbsp;pioneered the Jewish Enlightenment, or <em>Haskalah</em>, which advocated many of the same ideas about freedom and equal rights as those that&nbsp;Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant explored.&nbsp;Mendelssohn openly discussed the ways that Jews could live in a multi-religious society. &ldquo;Adopt the mores and constitution of the country in which you find yourself,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but be steadfast in upholding the religion of your fathers, too.&rdquo;*&nbsp;In subsequent generations, many Jews&mdash;among them, Karl Marx&rsquo;s parents&mdash;found it easier simply to convert to Christianity and live publicly as Christians in order to access jobs, property, and other basic rights.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Reform movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Isador Kaufmann, Man with Fur Hat, c. 1910, Vienna (The Jewish Museum, New York). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/47cb3f02e63fb844d162d5eb84bf5f935caddc99.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Isador Kaufmann, <em>Man with Fur Hat</em>, c. 1910, Vienna (The Jewish Museum, New York).&nbsp;&ldquo;Kaufmann&rsquo;s portraits of religiously devout Jews conveyed aspects of Jewish tradition that his audience of acculturated Jews and non-Jews would understand. Here, the sitters orthodoxy is indicated by his fur-trimmed shtraymel (hat) and black kapote (coat). Hung in well-appointed parlors....they...provided a connection to Jewish heritage by linking the world of cosmopolitan Vienna to a traditional lifestyle that endured outside the capital.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/man-with-fur-hat/ZAHnngZnzTGp6A?projectId=art-project\">Source</a></span></span>But there was another answer to the paradox posed by modernity.&nbsp;Inspired by Mendelssohn, Jewish questioners throughout German-speaking lands in the early nineteenth century developed the Reform movement.&nbsp;These reformers believed that their mission was to bring Judaism in line with modern thought; they also promoted the idea that prayers should be chanted in the local language rather than in Hebrew.&nbsp;They encouraged rabbis to look beyond the Talmud and Torah for guidance. Reformers spurned the idea that the past could dictate a way of life in an increasingly secular and&nbsp;industrial&nbsp;context.&nbsp;They modeled many of their religious practices after German Christians&nbsp;encouraging&nbsp;&ldquo;decorum&rdquo; in synagogue, introducing&nbsp;music similar to that heard in churches, and many even wanted to switch the Sabbath to Sunday. They wanted to remain Jews, while highlighting Judaism&rsquo;s similarities with Christianity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Orthodox movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These efforts infuriated traditionalists, who then reacted with steadfast conservatism.&nbsp; Some traditional rabbis had long opposed emancipation, but in response to the Reformers, a group of adherents to <em>Halakhah </em>codified the new Orthodox movement.&nbsp;They opposed many of the secular cultural forms that Judaism took in the coming decades: the Yiddishist movement, Zionism, and any other divergences from strict Halakhah. Some insisted that established customs not grounded in Jewish law should take on the weight of <em>Halakhah</em>&mdash;this is why some groups continue to dress and speak like their ancestors from a century ago or more.&nbsp; These extreme forms of observance are as much a product of modernity as Reform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Hasidic Judaism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Eastern Europe, another religious movement, called Hasidism, gained traction parallel to Reform and Orthodoxy.&nbsp;Founded in the eighteenth century by a rabbi and mystic who called himself Israel Baal Shem Tov, Hasidic Judaism grew out of a populist reaction to the elitism of the traditional Talmudic academy. Hasidic Judaism focuses on mystical interpretations of holy texts and the potential for uneducated Jews to experience holiness. The movement spread rapidly across Eastern and Central Europe. Hasidism&nbsp;gave rise to opposition from at least two sides: the traditional rabbinic legal structures that revolved around organized Torah study, and the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; Jews intent on both escaping the oppressive framework of the traditional Jewish family and acculturating into European society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In spite of Hasidic Judaism&rsquo;s strained history with what came to be known as Orthodoxy, it has become harder to distinguish stringent Orthodox Jews from their Hasidic counterparts. As Reform Judaism gained popularity, the two groups joined forces in support of Halakhah and in opposition to radical reform. Known for their distinctive dress (beards, fur hats, sidelocks, and caftans for men), Hasidim are among the most visible Jewish groups.</p>\n"

In 1939, it was sent to the Jewish Theological seminary in New York for safekeeping when the Nazis&#39; rise to power forced the Danzig Jewish community to disband.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/torah-crown/6gEqUFJXD4DlKw?projectId=art-project\">Source</a></span></span>Amidst political and economic turmoil in Western and Central Europe, nationalism&nbsp;became a rallying cry and pseudo-scientific&nbsp;ideas about&nbsp;race proliferated.&nbsp; A wave of antisemitism affected Jews within Europe and throughout the world in European&nbsp;colonies.

"\n"
"<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Zionism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Several events from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries proved that Jews were not welcomed as equals. In Russia, violent pogroms and economic instability pushed over two million people to emigrate&nbsp;in the 1880s. The vast majority fled to North America, and a small fraction of pioneers traveled to Palestine, the site of ancient Judaism&rsquo;s origins. Some Jewish leaders, responding to the growing nationalism and antisemitism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, followed Theodor Herzl&nbsp;who advocated for a type of&nbsp;secular Jewish nationalism, a return to the biblical homeland of the Jewish people.&nbsp;Religious Jews had prayed facing Jerusalem and called for a Messianic return to the Land of Israel since the Second Temple was destroyed. But the modern political movement, known as Zionism, united the religious impulse to &ldquo;return&rdquo; with&nbsp;secular ideas about constructing a European-style nation for Jews.&nbsp;It is important to note that Zionism was but one form of Jewish nationalism that took hold in the nineteenth century. Some Jews fought for territorial and political autonomy on different parts of the globe, others fought for cultural autonomy in the nations where they lived. These Diaspora nationalist movements mostly disappeared in 1948 when Israel became an&nbsp;independent state.</p>\n"

"<h3>Holocaust</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;The antisemite creates the Jew,&rdquo; wrote the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; Antisemitism had generated a false image of what a Jew is, making Jews seem like a social danger for the majority of Europeans. After World War I, liberal democracies everywhere appeared to be failing.&nbsp;The idea that Jews were responsible for social and economic crises convinced many&nbsp;to use race and ethnicity as a test to determine who&nbsp;belonged and who&nbsp;ought to be excluded.&nbsp;It was in this climate that the Nazi party was elected to power in 1933.&nbsp;Combining their expansionist vision with&nbsp;spurious theories of racial purity, the Germans quickly came to control most of central and eastern Europe.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Genocide became an everyday phenomenon&mdash;the Nuremburg Laws forced Jews to identify themselves with a badge, and criminalized sexual intimacy between Jews and gentiles. Laws were passed across Europe and the Mediterranean that excluded Jews from certain professions and the right to attend school.&nbsp;Citizenship was revoked and many people were&nbsp;forced&nbsp;from their homes into overcrowded wards.&nbsp;Inspired by the medieval ghetto, the Nazis went further&mdash;killing Jews by restricting food and medicine, packing thousands into spaces fit for far fewer, and, eventually, forbidding Jews to leave at all. Working in collaboration with governments across Europe, Nazi officials enacted a &ldquo;Final Solution&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Jewish Question&rdquo; in early 1942.&nbsp;Jews were forcibly&nbsp;gathered and shipped to local concentration camps and to death camps in Poland and Russia.&nbsp;Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.<br />\n"

"<h3><span>Going p</span><span>ublic</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Oldenburg had been designing large-scale, vinyl versions of household objects since his Green Gallery exhibition in 1962. He had created collages and drawings that played with the notion of massive domestic objects in public places, but <em>Lipstick</em> was his first large-scale public artwork. Oldenburg went on to make several other&nbsp;public sculptures that enlarged&nbsp;everyday domestic items to&nbsp;monumental dimensions.&nbsp;For example, he rendered a clothespin on the scale of an ancient Egyptian obelisk in a 1976 sculpture for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (below).<br />\n"

In doing so, it upheld Oldenburg&rsquo;s 1961 declaration that &ldquo;I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum [&hellip;]&nbsp;I am for an art that imitates the human, that is comic, if necessary, or violent, or whatever is necessary [&hellip;].&rdquo;[1]</p>\n"

"<p>Oldenburg had been designing large-scale, vinyl versions of household objects since his Green Gallery exhibition in 1962. He had created collages and drawings that played with the notion of massive domestic objects in public places, but <em>Lipstick</em> was his first large-scale public artwork. Oldenburg went on to make several other&nbsp;public sculptures that enlarged&nbsp;everyday domestic items to&nbsp;monumental dimensions.&nbsp;For example, he rendered a clothespin on the scale of an ancient Egyptian obelisk in a 1976 sculpture for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (below).<br />\n"

"<h3>Vitally important, but difficult to interpret</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some artifacts are of such vital importance to our understanding of ancient cultures that they are truly unique and utterly irreplaceable. The gold mask of Tutankhamun was allowed to leave Egypt for display overseas; the <em>Narmer Palette</em>, on the other hand, is so valuable that it has never been permitted to leave the country.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Discovered among a group of sacred implements ritually buried in a deposit within an early temple of the falcon god Horus at the site of Hierakonpolis (the capital of Egypt during the pre-dynastic period), this large ceremonial object is one of the most important artifacts from the dawn of Egyptian civilization. The beautifully carved palette, 63.5 cm (more than 2 feet) in height and made of smooth greyish-green siltstone, is decorated on both faces with detailed low relief. These scenes show a king, identified by name as Narmer, and a series of ambiguous scenes that have been difficult to interpret and have resulted in a number of theories regarding their meaning.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The high quality of the workmanship, its original function as a ritual object dedicated to a god, and the complexity of the imagery clearly indicate that this was a significant object, but a satisfactory interpretation of the scenes has been elusive.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What was the palette used for?&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The object itself is a monumental version of a type of daily use item commonly found in the predynastic period&mdash;palettes were generally flat, minimally decorated stone objects used for grinding and mixing minerals for cosmetics. Dark eyeliner was an essential aspect of life in the sun-drenched region; like the dark streaks placed under the eyes of modern athletes, black cosmetic around the eyes served to reduce glare. Basic cosmetic palettes were among the typical grave goods found during this early era.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to these simple, purely functional, palettes however, there were also a number of larger, far more elaborate palettes created in this period. These objects still served the function of being a ground for grinding and mixing cosmetics, but they were also carefully carved with relief sculpture. Many of the earlier palettes display animals &mdash;some real, some fantastic&mdash;while later examples, like the Narmer palette, focus on human actions. Research suggests that these decorated palettes were used in temple ceremonies, perhaps to grind or mix makeup to be ritually applied to the image of the god. Later temple ritual included elaborate daily ceremonies involving the anointing and dressing of divine images; these palettes likely indicate an early incarnation of this process.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A ceremonial object, ritually buried&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The&nbsp;<em>Palette of Narmer</em>&nbsp;was discovered in 1898 by James Quibell and Frederick Green. It was found with a collection of other objects that had been used for ceremonial purposes and then ritually buried within the temple at Hierakonpolis.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Temple caches of this type are not uncommon. There was a great deal of focus on ritual and votive objects (offerings to the God) in temples. Every ruler, elite individual, and anyone else who could afford it, donated items to the temple to show their piety and increase their connection to the deity. After a period of time, the temple would be full of these objects and space would need to be cleared for new votive donations. However, since they had been dedicated to a temple and sanctified, the old items that needed to be cleared out could not simply be thrown away or sold. Instead, the general practice was to bury them in a pit under the temple floor. Often, these caches include objects from a range of dates and a mix of types, from royal statuary to furniture.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Conventions that remain the same for thousands of years</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are several reasons the&nbsp;<em>Narmer Palette</em>&nbsp;is considered to be of such importance. First, it is one of very few such palettes discovered in a controlled excavation. Second, there are a number of formal and iconographic characteristics appearing on the Narmer palette that remain conventional in Egyptian two-dimensional art for the following three millennia. These include the way the figures are represented, the scenes being organized in regular horizontal zones known as registers, and the use of hierarchical scale to indicate relative importance of the individuals. &nbsp;In addition, much of the regalia worn by the king, such as the crowns, kilts, royal beard, and bull tail, as well as other visual elements, such as the pose Narmer takes on one of the faces where he grasps an enemy by the hair and prepares to smash his skull with a mace, continue to be utilized from this time all the way through the Roman era. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagram of the Palette of Narmer\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/27bf72277f66037a77361248ad891229e17c12e3.jpeg\" /></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What we see on the palette</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The king is represented twice in human form, once on each face, followed by his sandal-bearer. He may also be represented as a powerful bull, destroying a walled city with his massive horns, in a mode that again becomes conventional&mdash;pharaoh is regularly referred to as &quot;Strong Bull.&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to the primary scenes, the palette includes a pair of fantastic creatures, known as serpopards&mdash;leopards with long, snaky necks&mdash;who are collared and controlled by a pair of attendants. Their necks entwine and define the recess where the makeup preparation took place. The lowest register on both sides include images of dead foes, while both uppermost registers display hybrid human-bull heads and the name of the king. The frontal bull heads are likely connected to a sky goddess known as Bat and are related to heaven and the horizon. The name of the king, written hieroglyphically as a catfish and a chisel, is contained within a squared element that represents a palace facade.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Possible interpretation: unification of Upper and Lower Egypt</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As mentioned above, there have been a number of theories related to the scenes carved on this palette. Some have interpreted the battle scenes as a historical narrative record of the initial unification of Egypt under one ruler, supported by the general timing (as this is the period of the unification) and the fact that Narmer sports the crown connected to Upper Egypt on one face of the palette and the crown of Lower Egypt on the other&mdash;this is the first preserved example where both crowns are used by the same ruler. Other theories suggest that, rather than an actual historical representation, these scenes were purely ceremonial and related to the concept of unification in general.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Another interpretation: the sun and the king</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More recent research on the decorative program has connected the imagery to the careful balance of order and chaos (known as ma&rsquo;at and isfet) that was a fundamental element of the Egyptian idea of the cosmos. It may also be related to the daily journey of the sun god that becomes a central aspect in the Egyptian religion in the subsequent centuries.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The scene showing Narmer wearing the Lower Egyptian Red Crown (with its distinctive curl)* depicts him processing towards the decapitated bodies of his foes. The two rows of prone bodies are placed below an image of a high-prowed boat preparing to pass through an open gate. This may be an early reference to the journey of the sun god in his boat. In later texts, the Red Crown is connected with bloody battles fought by the sun god just before the rosy-fingered dawn on his daily journey and this scene may well be related to this. It is interesting to note that the foes are shown as not only executed, but rendered completely impotent&mdash;their castrated penises have been placed atop their severed heads.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On the other face, Narmer wears the Upper Egyptian White Crown* (which looks rather like a bowling pin) as he grasps an inert foe by the hair and prepares to crush his skull. The White Crown is related to the dazzling brilliance of the full midday sun at its zenith as well as the luminous nocturnal light of the stars and moon. By wearing both crowns, Narmer may not only be ceremonially expressing his dominance over the unified Egypt, but also the early importance of the solar cycle and the king&rsquo;s role in this daily process.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This fascinating object is an incredible example of early Egyptian art. The imagery preserved on this palette provides a peek ahead to the richness of both the visual aspects and religious concepts that develop in the ensuing periods. It is a vitally important artifact of extreme significance for our understanding of the development of Egyptian culture on multiple levels.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>*The Red Crown of Lower Egypt and the White Crown of Upper Egypt were the earliest crowns worn by the king and are closely connected with the unification of the country that sparks full-blown Egyptian civilization. The earliest representation of them worn by the same ruler is on the&nbsp;<em>Narmer Palette</em>, signifying that the king was ruling over both areas of the country. Soon after the unification, the fifth ruler of the First Dynasty is shown wearing the two crowns simultaneously, combined into one. This crown, often referred to as the Double Crown, remains a primary crown worn by pharaoh throughout Egyptian history. The separate Red and White crowns, however, continue to be worn as well and retain their geographic connections. There are a number of Egyptian words used for these crowns (nine for the White and 11 for the Red), but the most common&mdash;deshret and hedjet&mdash;refer to the colors red and white, respectively. It is from these identifying terms that we take their modern name. Early texts make it clear that these crowns were believed to be imbued with divine power and were personified as goddesses.</p>\n"

"<h3>The subject of the Flagellation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s <em>Flagellation of Christ</em> is proof that, sometimes, good things really do come in small packages. Despite the panel&rsquo;s size (only 58.4&nbsp;cm &times;&nbsp;81.5&nbsp;cm), the painting has been a mainstay in the last century in discussions of Quattrocento (fifteenth century) painting. An early example of the use of oil paint&mdash;though Piero used both tempera and oil in its execution&mdash;the work depicts the moment in Christ&rsquo;s Passion when he was whipped before Pontius Pilate. Though the New Testament says very little about this moment, mentioning only that Pilate ordered Christ to be flogged, later Christian writers wrote much about the event, and even speculated about the number of lashes Christ received. Though the New Testament does not say that Christ was tied to a column while being whipped, during the fifteenth century this became a convention in depictions of the scene, which Piero here follows. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A masterpiece of the Early Renaissance</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This painting is a masterpiece of the early Renaissance. The figures are expressive; especially noteworthy is the face of the bearded man in the foreground. They are also given real volume through the use of modeling (the passage from light to dark over the surface of an object). True to Humanism, the painting shows a preoccupation with the Classical world, as seen especially in the architecture and inclusion of the golden statue in the background. Above all, Piero&rsquo;s obsession with perspective (the naturalistic recession in to space), is evident. In fact, the artist was the author of a treatise on perspective, entitled <em>De Perspectiva Pingendi</em> (<em>On the Perspective of Painting</em>) and was also known as a mathematician and geometer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Three men in foreground (detail), Piero della Francesca, Flagellation of Christ, c. 1455-65, oil and tempera on wood, 58.4 × 81.5 cm (Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, Urbino)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e3c76033ca4efa0e8d046d4cdf0752751c86eb73.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Three men in foreground (detail), Piero della Francesca, <em>Flagellation of Christ</em>, c. 1455-65, oil and tempera on wood, 58.4 &times; 81.5 cm (Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, Urbino)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Who are the men in the foreground?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s picture is also highly unusual. The flagellation, which is the gruesome main event, takes place in the background, while three extraneous men are painted prominently in the foreground. Piero uses two main devices to further emphasize the division of subjects. The first is setting. While the flagellation takes place inside of a covered courtyard with dramatic black and white checked tiles, the men are outdoors standing on the reddish tiles that pervade the scene. The second is the use of the orthogonal lines of the perspective, which divide the painting in half, and also delineate the interior and exterior space.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Not only is the painting strange because Piero marginalized the primary subject, relegating it to the back of the painting, but also because art historians cannot agree on who the three men in the foreground are. Theories abound. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The traditional identification of these three men is that the young man in the center is Oddantanio da Montefeltro, ruler of Urbino, flanked on either side by his advisors. &nbsp;All three of these men were killed in a conspiracy. In this case, it is suggested that the patron of the painting was Federigo da Montefeltro (who was later immortalized in a famous diptych by Piero) to commemorate his brother&rsquo;s death and compare his innocence to that of Christ. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historian Marilyn Lavin offered another notable interpretation of the painting. She suggested that the two older men are Ludovico Gonzaga and a friend, who had both recently lost their sons, symbolized by the young man in the center. The painting in this case would compare the pain that the two fathers felt to that of Christ during his Passion. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other art historians have suggested that the painting is an allegory for the suffering of Constantinople after its fall to the Muslims in 1453. In this view, the two men watching the flagellation are Murad II (the Islamic sultan who waged a decades-long war against Christianity), and Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (against whom that war was waged). The emperor had gone to the 1438 Council of Florence to ask for protection from the Muslims, but received no aid. The three enigmatic men, then, represent nobles who stood by and let the Christian nation be destroyed. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Still another interpretation suggests that the key to understanding the painting lay in the lost inscription on the frame, which putatively said, &ldquo;Convenerunt in unum,&rdquo; or &ldquo;They come into one.&rdquo; This is a line from the Bible that was traditionally read each year on Good Friday, the day that commemorates Christ&rsquo;s Passion. &quot;They&rdquo; would refer then to the Sanhedrinists, or councilmen of Israel, who were present during Christ&rsquo;s suffering. In this way of looking at the panel, Piero did not include a contemporary political message, but rather painted a narrative that is true to the text, and depicts exactly what it purports to, the flagellation of Christ.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>No definitive interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The enigmatic nature of Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s <em>Flagellation</em> underscores the fact that works of art, regardless of their age, continue to engender interesting art historical research. In the case of this painting, it is unlikely that a definitive interpretation will ever be accepted, as there is little documentation to support a single argument. Perhaps this ambiguity is partially why the painting continues to intrigue, and, almost 600 years later, grants multiple entry points to the viewer, drawing him into Piero&rsquo;s fictional world.</p>\n"

"<p>The underground terracotta army found in the First Emperor&rsquo;s burial complex is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable and mysterious discoveries from the ancient world.&nbsp;A sprawling citadel has been unearthed, complete with gardens and stables, bronze ritual vessels, jade jewelry, and a wealth of gold and silver ornaments.</p>\n"

"<h3>Innovation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The First Emperor<span>&nbsp;known for stunning innovations that consolidated his rule through modernization. During his reign, he introduced the standardization of currency, writing, measurements and more. He connected cities and states with advanced systems of roads and canals.

"<h3><span>The First Emperor</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Qin Shihuang (259-210 B.C.E.) conquered much in this life, but his driving purpose was even greater;&nbsp;he sought to conquer death.&nbsp;In order to achieve immortality, he built himself a tomb&mdash;a vast underground city guarded by a life-size terracotta army including warriors, infantrymen, horses, chariots and all their attendant armor and weaponry.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The underground terracotta army found in the First Emperor&rsquo;s burial complex is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable and mysterious discoveries from the ancient world.&nbsp;A sprawling citadel has been unearthed, complete with gardens and stables, bronze ritual vessels, jade jewelry, and a wealth of gold and silver ornaments.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Besides revealing much about an ancient way of life, observing the physical construction of the underground complex and the methodical production of the figures reveals a set of themes from which we gain a window of insight to the First Emperor&rsquo;s worldview and enduring influence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Innovation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The First Emperor<span>&nbsp;known for stunning innovations that consolidated his rule through modernization. During his reign, he introduced the standardization of currency, writing, measurements and more. He connected cities and states with advanced systems of roads and canals. He is also credited with continuing the construction of the Great Wall, which is perhaps the most widely-known symbol still associated with China to this day.</span><br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>He is regarded as a military genius, and while his methods included massacre and destruction, some claim that his ultimate success at bringing the states together justifies the violence, a necessary cost of nation-building. We also see&nbsp;the first assembly-line style production in the creation of his terracotta warriors, horses and chariots.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Immortality</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the burial complex is what it suggests about the young Emperor&rsquo;s obsession with immortality.&nbsp;Driven to conquer death itself, the eventual First Emperor ascended to the throne of the Qin state at age of 13 and immediately began to plan his burial, and more importantly, his underground palace, a mausoleum attended by&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>According to Han-dynasty historian Sima Qian, the First Emperor lined his burial complex with a treasury of riches and piles of precious gemstones said to represent the stars, sun and moon. He was deeply concerned with the universe and looked to the cosmos as a guide for crossing over to an immortal existence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Excavation also revealed other mysterious findings, like strangely high levels of mercury and evidence that the poisonous substance coursed through an intricate system of underground troughs, replicating the topography of the actual rivers and seas carving the surrounding landscape. Some suggest that the emperor believed mercury had life-giving power and so surrounded himself with the toxic element, believing it was yet another way he might live forever.</p>\n"

"<h3>Boom times in Florence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The city-state of Florence in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries was a city on the rise. Urbanization was experienced by all Italian cities at this time and Florence&rsquo;s population doubled in size. But more than almost any other town, Florence saw an explosion in international trade and innovations in finance. A new class of bankers and merchants replaced the old noble families as the center of power, developing a complex, barely democratic social structure that hung in a careful balance.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"View of Palazzo della Signoria, 1299-1310, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ed62d6c1d186e237b36c66eb2f3d38bda01ce547.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">View of Palazzo della Signoria, 1299-1310, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art and architecture helped define the relationships between individuals and the bewildering array of civic, professional, and religious institutions that made up the fabric of Florentine society. Thanks to the city&rsquo;s newfound wealth, impressive communal building projects were undertaken, like the building of a new seat of government, the Palazzo della Signoria.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Church and state&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During this building boom, church and state were anything but separate. Public funds were used to erect many of the religious centers, including the cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. Subsidies were even given over to the large new churches needed to accommodate growing audiences for the sermons of the mendicant orders (monks that had forsaken worldly possessions and that lived and preached in the cities). The largest of these mendicant behemoths were the Franciscan church of Santa Croce and the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Guilds and private patrons too&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Happily, the decoration of buildings throughout the city fell to a widening range of patrons. Professional guilds (somewhat like our trade unions) were often in charge of decorating public spaces with painting and, increasingly, architectural sculpture. Groups of priests, nuns, and confraternities (organizations of laypeople that gathered to perform acts of charity or sing hymns) hired artists to create devotional images and lavish books of hymns. For the first time, wealthy individuals and families could even purchase the rights to use and decorate chapels within a church.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A more personal spirituality</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But art was not all about public displays of wealth or works of communal beautification. Faith and spirituality became more deeply personal even as they became more public. More than in previous centuries, images played an important role in focusing a person&rsquo;s devotion to Christ, Mary and the saints&mdash;in imagining their lives or picturing how they might appear in all their heavenly glory. In fact, images didn&rsquo;t just maintain relationships within Florentine society, they built imagined relationships between viewers and the sacred figures they portrayed. This affected more than just the amount of art people needed; it affected what they wanted it to look like. And in the course of the fourteenth century, what they wanted it to look like would change dramatically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Italo-Byzantine style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Coppo di Marcovaldo and his son Salerno, Crucifixion, 1274 (Pistoia Cathedral)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d47dafe9fd25ad5ca42d1bf43040ea05c76af576.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coppo di Marcovaldo and his son Salerno, <em>Crucifixion</em>, 1274 (Pistoia Cathedral)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like the art of most Italian cities at the time, thirteenth-century art in Florence was heavily influenced by Byzantine art (the art of the Byzantine Empire). Images from this period are in fact often described as &ldquo;Italo-Byzantine,&rdquo; a label that reflects how artists such as Coppo di Marcovaldo (and many more artists whose names we don&rsquo;t know) adapted the foreign style into something altogether Italian.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In painting, this meant emulating the way figures were strongly outlined against glittering gold backgrounds like those seen in Byzantine icons and mosaics. These ornate images seem to directly engage the viewer by pressing whatever is being depicted by the artist to the surface of the painting or mosaic. Figures are formed out of abstract but expressive shapes designed to identify various body parts or items of clothing while creating beautiful patterns. In narrative images, each story plays out across the field of representation instead of within it, eliminating the need for a sense of depth.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Cimabue, Santa Trinita Madonna (Madonna and Child Enthroned), 1280-90 tempera on panel (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/337136f84864b1990f529261ce815399bcae209e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Cimabue,<em> Santa Trinita Madonna (Madonna and Child Enthroned)</em>, 1280-90 tempera on panel (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>A new style emerges&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the late thirteenth century, artists in a handful of Italian cities began to move away from the Italo-Byzantine style. The Roman artist Pietro Cavallini created frescoes and mosaics featuring solid, monumentalizing figures; the sculptor Nicola Pisano studied ancient Roman sculpture; Sienese artists seem to have broken new ground in exploring perspective. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, back in Florence, Cimabue&rsquo;s paintings showed more interest in depicting space and modeling figures with gradations of light and shade. These ideas spread as artists travelled throughout Italy and southern France in search of work, creating a network of artistic centers that all exerted influence on one another.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Giotto di Bondone, The Ognissanti Madonna, 1306-10, tempera on panel, 128 x 80 1/4&quot; or 325 x 204 cm (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9afde9efa4109d1a56e7e6e00e5ae316d10c76a9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Giotto di Bondone, <em>The Ognissanti Madonna</em>, 1306-10, tempera on panel, 128 x 80 1/4&quot; or 325 x 204 cm (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence)</span></span>Giotto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As the new century opened, the painter Giotto di Bondone observed many of these currents and forged them into something distinctively Florentine and enormously influential.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where earlier works of art engage us with the embellished splendor of the heavenly, Giotto&rsquo;s paintings capture our attention by representing holy figures and stories as if in a majestic but earthly realm. Bold modeling of draperies and the bodies beneath them gives his figures greater volume and a sense of sculptural relief. Clever kinds of perspective create the illusion that a space is opening up in front of the viewer, as if we might be peering onto a stage.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Perhaps just as importantly, Giotto was a master of visual storytelling &ndash; a skill evident in his most important surviving project, the frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua (c. 1305). Here the monumentality of the figures, the quiet dignity of their movements, and the way architectural and landscape settings seem to echo the action all conjure up a solemn aura of the sacred. Like many of the narrative paintings attributed to Giotto, the scenes use closely observed human gestures and careful composition to enhance the drama and emotion of the moment depicted.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Art after Giotto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Giotto had an enormous workshop full of students and assistants, making it hard to tell which works he painted and which were by his pupils. Even more confusingly, his style was so immediately influential that it is still difficult to say who his formal students were. What we do know is that, in the years immediately after his death, the artists who were the most &ldquo;Giottesque&rdquo; received the lion&rsquo;s share of the important commissions for new projects. The success of artists like Bernardo Daddi, Maso di Banco, and Taddeo Gaddi demonstrates that wealthy patrons were on board with Giotto&rsquo;s new vision for art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sometime around mid-century, though, certain artists began to drift from the clear, spare art of Giotto&rsquo;s school. Many experimented with visually crowded compositions or with complex subjects represented through elaborate symbols and schemes. Some even seem to have purposefully echoed the ornamental, formal art of the Italo-Byzantine period. This has led art historians to wonder whether these changes in style were caused by Florence&rsquo;s collective despair after the outbreak of the bubonic plague&mdash;a sickness that wiped out over half the city&rsquo;s population in one year alone (1348).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e0bdde432f8605b350f3356d14877e7943773d81.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most scholars now think the situation was more mixed than this theory might lead us to believe. In fact, late fourteenth-century art is hard to generalize. This is partly because no single workshop dominated the art of Florence as much as Giotto and his school had in previous decades. But it is also because artists of the time were skilled at adapting their own style to the specific tastes of each patron and to the context and function of each image.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Overall, however, Florentine art from 1348 to 1400 did not experience the same kind of major stylistic shift that characterized Giotto&rsquo;s years on the scene. Rather, the fundamental influence of Giotto continued into the early 1400s. In the end, the long fourteenth-century was Giotto&rsquo;s century.</p>\n"

This affected more than just the amount of art people needed; it affected what they wanted it to look like. And in the course of the fourteenth century, what they wanted it to look like would change dramatically.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Like the art of most Italian cities at the time, thirteenth-century art in Florence was heavily influenced by Byzantine art (the art of the Byzantine Empire). Images from this period are in fact often described as &ldquo;Italo-Byzantine,&rdquo; a label that reflects how artists such as Coppo di Marcovaldo (and many more artists whose names we don&rsquo;t know) adapted the foreign style into something altogether Italian.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In painting, this meant emulating the way figures were strongly outlined against glittering gold backgrounds like those seen in Byzantine icons and mosaics. These ornate images seem to directly engage the viewer by pressing whatever is being depicted by the artist to the surface of the painting or mosaic. Figures are formed out of abstract but expressive shapes designed to identify various body parts or items of clothing while creating beautiful patterns. In narrative images, each story plays out across the field of representation instead of within it, eliminating the need for a sense of depth.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>During the late thirteenth century, artists in a handful of Italian cities began to move away from the Italo-Byzantine style. The Roman artist Pietro Cavallini created frescoes and mosaics featuring solid, monumentalizing figures; the sculptor Nicola Pisano studied ancient Roman sculpture; Sienese artists seem to have broken new ground in exploring perspective. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, back in Florence, Cimabue&rsquo;s paintings showed more interest in depicting space and modeling figures with gradations of light and shade. These ideas spread as artists travelled throughout Italy and southern France in search of work, creating a network of artistic centers that all exerted influence on one another.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>As the new century opened, the painter Giotto di Bondone observed many of these currents and forged them into something distinctively Florentine and enormously influential.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where earlier works of art engage us with the embellished splendor of the heavenly, Giotto&rsquo;s paintings capture our attention by representing holy figures and stories as if in a majestic but earthly realm. Bold modeling of draperies and the bodies beneath them gives his figures greater volume and a sense of sculptural relief. Clever kinds of perspective create the illusion that a space is opening up in front of the viewer, as if we might be peering onto a stage.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Perhaps just as importantly, Giotto was a master of visual storytelling &ndash; a skill evident in his most important surviving project, the frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua (c. 1305). Here the monumentality of the figures, the quiet dignity of their movements, and the way architectural and landscape settings seem to echo the action all conjure up a solemn aura of the sacred. Like many of the narrative paintings attributed to Giotto, the scenes use closely observed human gestures and careful composition to enhance the drama and emotion of the moment depicted.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Art after Giotto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Giotto had an enormous workshop full of students and assistants, making it hard to tell which works he painted and which were by his pupils. Even more confusingly, his style was so immediately influential that it is still difficult to say who his formal students were. What we do know is that, in the years immediately after his death, the artists who were the most &ldquo;Giottesque&rdquo; received the lion&rsquo;s share of the important commissions for new projects. The success of artists like Bernardo Daddi, Maso di Banco, and Taddeo Gaddi demonstrates that wealthy patrons were on board with Giotto&rsquo;s new vision for art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sometime around mid-century, though, certain artists began to drift from the clear, spare art of Giotto&rsquo;s school. Many experimented with visually crowded compositions or with complex subjects represented through elaborate symbols and schemes. Some even seem to have purposefully echoed the ornamental, formal art of the Italo-Byzantine period. This has led art historians to wonder whether these changes in style were caused by Florence&rsquo;s collective despair after the outbreak of the bubonic plague&mdash;a sickness that wiped out over half the city&rsquo;s population in one year alone (1348).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e0bdde432f8605b350f3356d14877e7943773d81.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most scholars now think the situation was more mixed than this theory might lead us to believe. In fact, late fourteenth-century art is hard to generalize. This is partly because no single workshop dominated the art of Florence as much as Giotto and his school had in previous decades. But it is also because artists of the time were skilled at adapting their own style to the specific tastes of each patron and to the context and function of each image.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Overall, however, Florentine art from 1348 to 1400 did not experience the same kind of major stylistic shift that characterized Giotto&rsquo;s years on the scene. Rather, the fundamental influence of Giotto continued into the early 1400s. In the end, the long fourteenth-century was Giotto&rsquo;s century.</p>\n"

The open space in front of the house, known as a&nbsp;<em>marae</em>, is used as an assembly ground.&nbsp;They were, and still are, used for entertaining, for funerals, religious and political meetings.&nbsp;It is a focus of tribal pride and is treated with great respect.<br />\n"

This is not unusual, varying numbers of fingers are to be found on Maori carvings, and may be due to regional differences in style, rather than having a symbolic meaning.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The style of carving - the solidly proportioned body and large hands&mdash;is typical of the prominent Ngati Kahungunu school of carvers from the central Hawkes Bay district, in the mid-nineteenth century. The majority of Maori carving from this period is more stylized than this figure. This naturalistic style may have been intended to emphasize the social or human side of the ancestor represented.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Maori meeting house increased in size and height during the nineteenth century, due partly to European influence. Consequently <em>poutokomanawa</em> figures increased in size until the largest were around two meters high.</p>\n"

"<h3>Private Art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But the emperor also commissioned small private works of art such as gems, and cameos. Unlike art in the public sphere, private art would not have been seen by a large audience. Instead, only a select few would have been granted access. If you were lucky enough to be invited to a dinner party at the emperor&rsquo;s palace, he might display his gem collection or show off his large imperial cameos. However, despite the fact that private art would not have been seen by the majority of Roman citizens, the messages contained within these works would have functioned in much the same way as their public counterparts. So if you were at that dinner party with Augustus and he showed you a large cameo, that cameo would have advertised the emperor&rsquo;s military victories, his role as the bringer of peace, and his connection to the gods.</p>\n"

"<p>Cameos were a popular medium in the private art of the Roman Empire. While cameos first appeared in the Hellenistic period, they became most fashionable under the Romans. Typically cameos were made of a brown stone that had bands or layers of white throughout, such as sardonyx. This layered stone was then carved in such a way that the figures stood out in white relief while the background remained the dark part of the stone. Most cameos were small and functioned as pendants or rings. But there are a few examples of much larger cameos that were specifically commissioned by the emperor and members of his imperial circle, the most famous example is the Gemma Augustea.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Gemma Augustea</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Gemma Augustea is divided into two registers that are crammed with figures and iconography. The upper register contains three historical figures and a host of deities and personifications. Our eyes immediately gravitate towards the center of the upper register and the two large enthroned figures, Roma (the personification of the city of Rome) and the emperor Augustus. Roma is surrounded by military paraphernalia while Augustus holds a scepter, a symbol of his right to rule and his role as the leader of the Roman Empire. At his feet is an eagle, a symbol of the god Jupiter and so we quickly realize that Augustus has close ties to the gods. Augustus is depicted as a heroic semi-nude, a convention usually reserved for deities. Augustus is not only stating that he has connections to gods, he is stating that he is also god-like.</p>\n"

"<p>Two other historical figures accompany Augustus in the upper register. At the far left is Tiberius, who will eventually succeed Augustus on the throne. To the right of Tiberius is the young Germanicus, another member of Augustus&rsquo; family and a potential heir to the throne. Clearly the Gemma Augustea is making Augustus&rsquo; dynastic message clear: he hopes that Tiberius or Germanicus will succeed him after he dies.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Interspersed amongst the three historical figures of the upper register are deities and personifications. Directly behind Tiberius is winged Victory. Behind Augustus is Oikoumene, the personification of the civilized world, who places a corona civica (civic crown) on the emperor&rsquo;s head. In the Roman Empire, it was a great honor to be awarded the civic crown as it was only given to someone who had saved Roman citizens from an enemy (and Augustus had certainly done just that by rescuing Romans from civil war). Oceanus, the personification of the oceans, sits on the far right. Finally, Tellus Italiae, the mother earth goddess and personification of Italy, sits with her two chubby children and holds a cornucopia.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Pax Romana</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What does the top register mean, with its grouping of mortals, deities, and personifications? In short, everything praises Augustus. The emperor expresses his domination throughout the Roman Empire and his greatest accomplishment, the pacification of the Roman world, which resulted in fertility and prosperity. Augustus&rsquo; peace and dominion will spread not only throughout the city of Rome (represented by the goddess Roma), but also to all of Italy (represented by Tellus Italiae) and throughout the entire civilized world (symbolized by Oikoumene). And as to Tiberius and Germanicus, Augustus&rsquo; potential heirs, either will continue the peace and prosperity established by Augustus.</p>\n"

"<p><span>The lower register is significantly smaller than the upper, but it nevertheless has plenty of figures in its two scenes, both of which show captive barbarians and victorious Romans. At the left, Roman soldiers raise a trophy while degraded and humiliated barbarians sit at their feet. At the right is a similar scene, with barbarians being brought into submission by Roman soldiers.

In his summary, Plautus gives the reader the sense that one could find just about every sort of person in the forum&mdash;from criminals and hustlers to politicians and&nbsp;prostitutes. His summary reminds us that in the city of Rome the Forum Romanum was the key political, ritual, and civic center. Located in a valley separating the Capitoline and Palatine Hills, the Forum developed from the earliest times and remained in use after the city&rsquo;s eventual decline; during that span of time the forum witnessed the growth and eventual contraction of the city and her empire.&nbsp;The archaeological remains of the Forum Romanum&nbsp;itself continue to provide important insights into the phases and processes associated with urbanism and monumentality in ancient Rome.</p>\n"

The Capitoline Hill, opposite the Palatine, emerged as the city&rsquo;s citadel (<em>arx</em>) and site of the poliadic cult of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, among others (poliadic:&nbsp;the chief civic cult of an ancient city, derived from the Greek word &quot;polis&quot;).</p>\n"

"<p>Iron Age populations had used the marshy valley separating the Palatine and Capitoline hills as a necropolis (a large ancient cemetery), but the burgeoning settlement of archaic Rome had need of communal space and the valley was repurposed from a necropolis to a usable space.

Burial activity&nbsp;had to be transferred elsewhere; for this reason the main necropolis site shifted to the far side of the Esquiline Hill.<br />\n"

Since the Tiber river tended to leave its banks regularly, the valley was prone to significant flooding, as a low saddle of land known as the Velabrum connects the forum valley to the riverine zone. As coring studies conducted&nbsp;by Albert J. Ammerman have shown, a deliberate landfill project deposited fill in the forum valley in order to create usable, dry levels during the sixth century B.C.E. Twentieth century excavators, including Giacomo Boni and Einar Gjerstad, revealed important remains of Iron Age burials that pre-dated the establishment of the forum valley as a civic space; in particular the necropolis in the area known as the <em>Sepulcretum</em> along the Sacra Via (&quot;Sacred Way,&quot; the&nbsp;main sacred processional road of the city)&nbsp;has been extensively studied and published.&nbsp;The investigations of the burials themselves, and the patterns they followed, have allowed archaeologists to understand not only funeral customs but also social dynamics during Rome&rsquo;s proto-urban phases.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>This major investment in the creation of civic space and the organization of labor also provides important information about the socio-economic structure of early Rome (Livy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi0011.perseus-eng3\">1.59.9</a>). The drainage canal eventually came to have a vaulted covering and was known as the <em>Cloaca Maxima</em> or &quot;Great Drain.&quot;&nbsp;One of the clear outcomes of these civic investments was the creation of a usable space that came to be a civic focus for activities in many spheres, especially political and sacred functions.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Temples and sacred buildings</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the Early Republican period the forum space saw the construction of key temples. One of the most prominent early temples is the Temple of Saturn (often considered the earliest of the temples in the Forum Romanum), the first iteration of which dates c. 498 B.C.E. The temple was dedicated to Saturn, the god of agriculture, and housed the state treasury. The temple was rebuilt in 42 B.C.E. and again after 283 C.E. Another early Republican temple is the Temple of the Castors (a.k.a. Temple of Castor and Pollux) that was completed in 484 B.C.E. and was dedicated to the Gemini who had aided the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 B.C.E. The temple had several construction phases. The Sacra Via&nbsp;passed along the forum square en route to the Capitoline Hill and the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. This sacred route was used for certain state-level ceremonies, especially the celebration of the victory ritual known as the Roman triumph.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Temple of Vesta\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8a44fb3981a08f0458e14bb1cf92414c195a9bcf.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Temple of Vesta</span></span>Two other early, sacred buildings are important to note. These are the Regia or &quot;king&rsquo;s house&quot;&nbsp;and the Temple of Vesta, both located on the downward slope of the Palatine Hill near the point where it reaches the edge of the Forum Romanum proper. Both of these sacred buildings are quite ancient and had many building phases, making it difficult to refine the chronology of the earliest phases. The Regia served as a ceremonial home for the king&mdash;later passing into the ownership of the pontifex maximus (principal state-level priesthood) once the kings had been expelled&mdash;and consisted of an irregularly planned suite of rooms surrounding a courtyard. The sixth century B.C.E. phase was decorated with painted plaques of architectural terracotta, clearly indicating both elite function and investment. Across the way was the Temple of Vesta, focused on the maternal elements of the archaic state as well as safeguarding the cult of Vesta and the sacred, eternal hearth flame of the Roman people. Both the Regia and the Temple of Vesta developed from crude structures in earlier phases to stone-built architecture in later phases. The Severan family carried out the final significant&nbsp;restoration of the Temple of Vesta in 191 C.E..</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Meeting spaces</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Important meeting spaces for political bodies emerged at the northwest side of the forum, namely a pair of complexes known as the Curia and Comitium. The Curia served as the council house for the Roman Senate, although the Senate could convene in any inaugurated space (i.e. a space ritually demarcated by Roman priests). The Curia emerged perhaps in the seventh century B.C.E., although little is known about its earliest phases. The surviving Curia is an imperial rebuilding of the Late Republican phase known as the Curia Julia, since Julius Caesar was its architectural patron. The Comitium was a tiered space that lay in front of the Curia that served as an open-air meeting space for public assemblies. Little of the Comitium remains today but it was a key architectural complex for political and sacred events during the time of the Roman Republic.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>From Republic to Empire</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the fourth and third centuries B.C.E. the Forum Romanum certainly continued to develop, but material remains of large-scale architecture have proven elusive and thus our understanding of the space during those centuries is less clear than in other periods. One middle Republican development is the continued elaboration of the Rostra, the platform from which orators would speak to those assembled in the forum square. This monument would continue to develop over time and took its name from the prows (<em>rostra</em>) of defeated enemy warships that were mounted on its fa&ccedil;ade.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The later second and first centuries B.C.E., the Late Republican period, witnessed many changes in the city and in the Forum Romanum. The successes of Rome and her growing empire during the second and first centuries B.C.E. led to a great deal of monumental construction in the city, including in the Forum Romanum itself. It was during this Late Republican phase that Rome became a metropolitan center, equipped with the monumental architecture that could compete with&mdash;if not eclipse&mdash;that of the foreign powers Rome had tamed during the Punic Wars and those against the Hellenistic kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean. In particular the Romans established a&nbsp;tradition of constructing monuments commemorating famous men who had achieved great success in military and public careers. The first of these was the <em>Columna Rostrata</em> that marked the naval victory of Caius Duilius at the naval battle of Mylae in 260 B.C.E. The Roman interest in monumental, commemorative monuments, now referred to as triumphal arches, would soon follow.&nbsp;The first of these, the Fabian arch (<em>fornix Fabianus</em>), was dedicated on the Sacra Via toward the eastern end of the Forum Romanum in 121 B.C.E., commemorating the military victories (and family) of Quintus Fabius Allobrogicus (Cicero <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/474/28/0#4\">pro Planc. 17</a>). While the Fabian monument is no longer extant, its construction established a tradition&nbsp;(and a traditional form) for official commemorative and honorific monuments in the context of Roman public art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Basilica</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The second century B.C.E. saw the creation and introduction of a unique Roman building type, the basilica. The basilica was a columnar hall that often had a multi-purpose use&mdash;from law courts to commerce to entertainments. Roman planners came to prefer them for lining the long sides of open squares, in a way not dissimilar from the Greek stoa. The sources claim that the Basilica Porcia (c. 184 B.C.E.) was the first basilica built at Rome, although no trace of it remains. The Basilica Porcia served as an office for the tribunes of the plebs. Other, more elaborate basilicae were soon to be built, including the famous Basilica Aemilia, first built in 179 B.C.E., and remodeled from c. 55 to 34 B.C.E. as the Basilica Paulli. Restored again after a fire in 14 B.C.E., the famous basilica was deemed by Pliny the Elder to be one of the three most beautiful monuments in Rome (Plin. <em>HN</em> <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/978/1/0#2619\">36.102.5</a>)</p>\n"

"<h3>Imperial period</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The advent of the principate of Augustus (27 B.C.E. &ndash; 14 C.E.) brought about additions and renovations to the Forum Romanum. With the deification of Julius Caesar, Augustus&rsquo; adoptive father, a temple dedicated to Caesar&rsquo;s cult (<em>templum&nbsp;divi Iulii</em>) was constructed on the edge of the forum square (15 in the diagram below).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus restored existing buildings, completed incomplete projects, and added commemorative projects to celebrate his own accomplishments and those of his family members. In this latter group, the Arch of Augustus (#16 above) and the Porticus of Caius and Lucius are notable. The former was a triumphal arch celebrating significant military and diplomatic accomplishments of the emperor, while the latter honored the emperor&rsquo;s grandsons. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus also followed Julius Caesar in creating yet another new forum space beyond the Forum Romanum that was named the Forum of Augustus.&nbsp;(dedicated in 2 B.C.E.). These new Imperial Fora in some cases provided additional space and, in turn, shifted attention away from the Forum Romanum.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Imperial period the Forum Romanum itself saw only sporadic new construction, although the maintenance of the existing structures would have provided a pressing and ongoing obligation. Just beyond the limit of the forum proper the second century C.E. temple of Antoninus Pius and his wife Faustina was constructed in 141 C.E. (and then modified in 161 C.E. following the emperor&rsquo;s death).&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Decline</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Declining imperial fortunes led inevitably to urban decay at Rome. After the Severan and Tetrarchic building programs of the third century C.E. and Constantinian investment in the early fourth century C.E., the forum and its environs began to decline and decay.&nbsp;Constantine I officially relocated the administrative center of the Roman world to Constantinople in 330 C.E. and Theodosius I suppressed all &quot;pagan&quot;&nbsp;religions and ordered temples shut permanently in 394 C.E. These changes, coupled with population decline, spelled the gradual demise of spaces like the Forum Romanum. Roman monuments were cannibalized for building materials and open, unused spaces were re-purposed&mdash;sometimes as ad hoc dwellings and other times for the deposition of rubbish and fill. Thus the forum slowly yielded its sacro-civic functions to more mundane concerns like pasturage&mdash;in fact it eventually came to be known as the &ldquo;Campo Vaccino&rdquo; (cow field).</p>\n"

"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"View of the Roman Forum\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/67a0d85eaa60a2835ca2ec9c46dbdb23fb10e5ac.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">View of the Roman Forum</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beauty of the ruins</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monument that is considered to be the final ancient structure erected in the Forum Romanum is a re-purposed monumental column set in place by the emperor Phocas in August of 608 C.E. The anonymous Einsiedeln itinerary, written in the eighth century C.E., mentions a general state of decay in the forum. A major earthquake in 847 C.E. wreaked considerable damage on remaining Roman monuments in the forum and in its environs. During the Middle Ages ancient structures provided reusable buildings materials, as well as reusable foundations, for Medieval structures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ruins themselves provided endless inspiration for artists, including painters the likes of Canaletto who became interested in the romanticism of the ruins of the ancient city as well as for cartographers and engravers the likes of G. B. Piranesi and G. Vasi, among others, who created views of the ruins themselves and restored plans of the ancient city.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Forum Romanum, despite being a relatively small space, was central to the function and identity of the city of Rome (and the wider Roman empire). The Forum Romanum played a key role in creating&nbsp;a communal focal point, one toward which various members of a diverse socio-economic community could gravitate. In that centralized space community rituals that served a larger purpose of group unity could be performed and observed and elites could reinforce social hierarchy through the display of monumental art and architecture. These devices that could create and continually reinforce not only a sense of community belonging but also the existing social hierarchy were of vital importance in archaic states. Even as the Forum Romanum changed over time, it remained an important space. After a series of emperors chose to build new forum complexes (the Imperial Fora)&nbsp;adjacent to the Forum Romanum, it retained its symbolic importance, especially considering that, as a people, ancient Romans were incredibly loyal to ancestral practices and traditions.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Rediscovery and excavation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of the monuments of the Forum Romanum, along with ancient occupation levels, gradually disappeared from view. Systematic exploration and study began under archaeologist Carlo Fea who started to clear the area near the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803. Study continued during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with prominent scholars including Rodolfo Lanciani, Giacomo Boni, Einar Gjerstad,&nbsp;and Andrea Carandini, among others, leading major campaigns. Study and excavation&mdash;as well as the hugely important obligation of preservation&mdash;continue in the Forum Romanum today. The bulk of the forum is accessible to visitors who have the opportunity to experience one of the great documents of urban archaeology.</p>\n"

In his summary, Plautus gives the reader the sense that one could find just about every sort of person in the forum&mdash;from criminals and hustlers to politicians and&nbsp;prostitutes. His summary reminds us that in the city of Rome the Forum Romanum was the key political, ritual, and civic center. Located in a valley separating the Capitoline and Palatine Hills, the Forum developed from the earliest times and remained in use after the city&rsquo;s eventual decline; during that span of time the forum witnessed the growth and eventual contraction of the city and her empire.&nbsp;The archaeological remains of the Forum Romanum&nbsp;itself continue to provide important insights into the phases and processes associated with urbanism and monumentality in ancient Rome.</p>\n"

Burial activity&nbsp;had to be transferred elsewhere;&nbsp;or this reason the main necropolis site shifted to the far side of the Esquiline Hill.<br />\n"

Since the Tiber river tended to leave its banks regularly, the valley was prone to significant flooding, as a low saddle of land known as the Velabrum connects the forum valley to the riverine zone. As coring studies conducted&nbsp;by Albert J. Ammerman have shown, a deliberate landfill project deposited fill in the forum valley in order to create usable, dry levels during the sixth century B.C.E. Twentieth century excavators, including Giacomo Boni and Einar Gjerstad, revealed important remains of Iron Age burials that pre-dated the establishment of the forum valley as a civic space; in particular the necropolis in the area known as the <em>Sepulcretum</em> along the Sacra Via (&quot;Sacred Way,&quot; the&nbsp;main sacred processional road of the city)&nbsp;has been extensively studied and published.&nbsp;The investigations of the burials themselves, and the patterns they followed, have allowed archaeologists to understand not only funeral customs but also social dynamics during Rome&rsquo;s proto-urban phases.<br />\n"

"<p>This major investment in the creation of civic space and the organization of labor also provides important information about the socio-economic structure of early Rome (Livy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi0011.perseus-eng3\">1.59.9</a>). The drainage canal eventually came to have a vaulted covering and was known as the <em>Cloaca Maxima</em> or &quot;Great Drain.&quot;&nbsp;One of the clear outcomes of these civic investments was the creation of a usable space that came to be a civic focus for activities in many spheres, especially political and sacred functions.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Temples and sacred buildings</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the Early Republican period the forum space saw the construction of key temples. One of the most prominent early temples is the Temple of Saturn (often considered the earliest of the temples in the Forum Romanum), the first iteration of which dates c. 498 B.C.E. The temple was dedicated to Saturn, the god of agriculture, and housed the state treasury. The temple was rebuilt in 42 B.C.E. and again after 283 C.E. Another early Republican temple is the Temple of the Castors (a.k.a. Temple of Castor and Pollux) that was completed in 484 B.C.E. and was dedicated to the Gemini who had aided the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 B.C.E. The temple had several construction phases. The Sacra Via&nbsp;passed along the forum square en route to the Capitoline Hill and the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. This sacred route was used for certain state-level ceremonies, especially the celebration of the victory ritual known as the Roman triumph.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Temple of Vesta\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8a44fb3981a08f0458e14bb1cf92414c195a9bcf.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Temple of Vesta</span></span>Two other early, sacred buildings are important to note. These are the Regia or &quot;king&rsquo;s house&quot;&nbsp;and the Temple of Vesta, both located on the downward slope of the Palatine Hill near the point where it reaches the edge of the Forum Romanum proper. Both of these sacred buildings are quite ancient and had many building phases, making it difficult to refine the chronology of the earliest phases. The Regia served as a ceremonial home for the king&mdash;later passing into the ownership of the pontifex maximus (principal state-level priesthood) once the kings had been expelled&mdash;and consisted of an irregularly planned suite of rooms surrounding a courtyard. The sixth century B.C.E. phase was decorated with painted plaques of architectural terracotta, clearly indicating both elite function and investment. Across the way was the Temple of Vesta, focused on the maternal elements of the archaic state as well as safeguarding the cult of Vesta and the sacred, eternal hearth flame of the Roman people. Both the Regia and the Temple of Vesta developed from crude structures in earlier phases to stone-built architecture in later phases. The Severan family carried out the final significant&nbsp;restoration of the Temple of Vesta in 191 C.E..</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Meeting spaces</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Important meeting spaces for political bodies emerged at the northwest side of the forum, namely a pair of complexes known as the Curia and Comitium. The Curia served as the council house for the Roman Senate, although the Senate could convene in any inaugurated space (i.e. a space ritually demarcated by Roman priests). The Curia emerged perhaps in the seventh century B.C.E., although little is known about its earliest phases. The surviving Curia is an imperial rebuilding of the Late Republican phase known as the Curia Julia, since Julius Caesar was its architectural patron. The Comitium was a tiered space that lay in front of the Curia that served as an open-air meeting space for public assemblies. Little of the Comitium remains today but it was a key architectural complex for political and sacred events during the time of the Roman Republic.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>From Republic to Empire</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the fourth and third centuries B.C.E. the Forum Romanum certainly continued to develop, but material remains of large-scale architecture have proven elusive and thus our understanding of the space during those centuries is less clear than in other periods. One middle Republican development is the continued elaboration of the Rostra, the platform from which orators would speak to those assembled in the forum square. This monument would continue to develop over time and took its name from the prows (<em>rostra</em>) of defeated enemy warships that were mounted on its fa&ccedil;ade.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The later second and first centuries B.C.E., the Late Republican period, witnessed many changes in the city and in the Forum Romanum. The successes of Rome and her growing empire during the second and first centuries B.C.E. led to a great deal of monumental construction in the city, including in the Forum Romanum itself. It was during this Late Republican phase that Rome became a metropolitan center, equipped with the monumental architecture that could compete with&mdash;if not eclipse&mdash;that of the foreign powers Rome had tamed during the Punic Wars and those against the Hellenistic kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean. In particular the Romans established a&nbsp;tradition of constructing monuments commemorating famous men who had achieved great success in military and public careers. The first of these was the <em>Columna Rostrata</em> that marked the naval victory of Caius Duilius at the naval battle of Mylae in 260 B.C.E. The Roman interest in monumental, commemorative monuments, now referred to as triumphal arches, would soon follow.&nbsp;The first of these, the Fabian arch (<em>fornix Fabianus</em>), was dedicated on the Sacra Via toward the eastern end of the Forum Romanum in 121 B.C.E., commemorating the military victories (and family) of Quintus Fabius Allobrogicus (Cicero <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/474/28/0#4\">pro Planc. 17</a>). While the Fabian monument is no longer extant, its construction established a tradition&nbsp;(and a traditional form) for official commemorative and honorific monuments in the context of Roman public art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Basilica</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The second century B.C.E. saw the creation and introduction of a unique Roman building type, the basilica. The basilica was a columnar hall that often had a multi-purpose use&mdash;from law courts to commerce to entertainments. Roman planners came to prefer them for lining the long sides of open squares, in a way not dissimilar from the Greek stoa. The sources claim that the Basilica Porcia (c. 184 B.C.E.) was the first basilica built at Rome, although no trace of it remains. The Basilica Porcia served as an office for the tribunes of the plebs. Other, more elaborate basilicae were soon to be built, including the famous Basilica Aemilia, first built in 179 B.C.E., and remodeled from c. 55 to 34 B.C.E. as the Basilica Paulli. Restored again after a fire in 14 B.C.E., the famous basilica was deemed by Pliny the Elder to be one of the three most beautiful monuments in Rome (Plin. <em>HN</em> <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/978/1/0#2619\">36.102.5</a>)</p>\n"

"<h3>Imperial period</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The advent of the principate of Augustus (27 B.C.E. &ndash; 14 C.E.) brought about additions and renovations to the Forum Romanum. With the deification of Julius Caesar, Augustus&rsquo; adoptive father, a temple dedicated to Caesar&rsquo;s cult (<em>templum&nbsp;divi Iulii</em>) was constructed on the edge of the forum square (15 in the diagram below).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus restored existing buildings, completed incomplete projects, and added commemorative projects to celebrate his own accomplishments and those of his family members. In this latter group, the Arch of Augustus (#16 above) and the Porticus of Caius and Lucius are notable. The former was a triumphal arch celebrating significant military and diplomatic accomplishments of the emperor, while the latter honored the emperor&rsquo;s grandsons. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus also followed Julius Caesar in creating yet another new forum space beyond the Forum Romanum that was named the Forum of Augustus.&nbsp;(dedicated in 2 B.C.E.). These new Imperial Fora in some cases provided additional space and, in turn, shifted attention away from the Forum Romanum.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Imperial period the Forum Romanum itself saw only sporadic new construction, although the maintenance of the existing structures would have provided a pressing and ongoing obligation. Just beyond the limit of the forum proper the second century C.E. temple of Antoninus Pius and his wife Faustina was constructed in 141 C.E. (and then modified in 161 C.E. following the emperor&rsquo;s death).&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Decline</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Declining imperial fortunes led inevitably to urban decay at Rome. After the Severan and Tetrarchic building programs of the third century C.E. and Constantinian investment in the early fourth century C.E., the forum and its environs began to decline and decay.&nbsp;Constantine I officially relocated the administrative center of the Roman world to Constantinople in 330 C.E. and Theodosius I suppressed all &quot;pagan&quot;&nbsp;religions and ordered temples shut permanently in 394 C.E. These changes, coupled with population decline, spelled the gradual demise of spaces like the Forum Romanum. Roman monuments were cannibalized for building materials and open, unused spaces were re-purposed&mdash;sometimes as ad hoc dwellings and other times for the deposition of rubbish and fill. Thus the forum slowly yielded its sacro-civic functions to more mundane concerns like pasturage&mdash;in fact it eventually came to be known as the &ldquo;Campo Vaccino&rdquo; (cow field).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The beauty of the ruins</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monument that is considered to be the final ancient structure erected in the Forum Romanum is a re-purposed monumental column set in place by the emperor Phocas in August of 608 C.E. The anonymous Einsiedeln itinerary, written in the eighth century C.E., mentions a general state of decay in the forum. A major earthquake in 847 C.E. wreaked considerable damage on remaining Roman monuments in the forum and in its environs. During the Middle Ages ancient structures provided reusable buildings materials, as well as reusable foundations, for Medieval structures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ruins themselves provided endless inspiration for artists, including painters the likes of Canaletto who became interested in the romanticism of the ruins of the ancient city as well as for cartographers and engravers the likes of G. B. Piranesi and G. Vasi, among others, who created views of the ruins themselves and restored plans of the ancient city.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Forum Romanum, despite being a relatively small space, was central to the function and identity of the city of Rome (and the wider Roman empire). The Forum Romanum played a key role in creating&nbsp;a communal focal point, one toward which various members of a diverse socio-economic community could gravitate. In that centralized space community rituals that served a larger purpose of group unity could be performed and observed and elites could reinforce social hierarchy through the display of monumental art and architecture. These devices that could create and continually reinforce not only a sense of community belonging but also the existing social hierarchy were of vital importance in archaic states. Even as the Forum Romanum changed over time, it remained an important space. After a series of emperors chose to build new forum complexes (the Imperial Fora)&nbsp;adjacent to the Forum Romanum, it retained its symbolic importance, especially considering that, as a people, ancient Romans were incredibly loyal to ancestral practices and traditions.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Rediscovery and excavation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of the monuments of the Forum Romanum, along with ancient occupation levels, gradually disappeared from view. Systematic exploration and study began under archaeologist Carlo Fea who started to clear the area near the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803. Study continued during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with prominent scholars including Rodolfo Lanciani, Giacomo Boni, Einar Gjerstad,&nbsp;and Andrea Carandini, among others, leading major campaigns. Study and excavation&mdash;as well as the hugely important obligation of preservation&mdash;continue in the Forum Romanum today. The bulk of the forum is accessible to visitors who have the opportunity to experience one of the great documents of urban archaeology.</p>\n"

"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> are located in an area bounded on the southwest by the Capitoline Hill, on the northeast by the Quirinal Hill, and extending toward the Esquiline Hill to the east. The <em>fora</em> were initially built between c. 54 B.C.E. and 113 C.E., with continuing additions, restorations, and modifications through late antiquity. In the middle ages the <em>fora</em> were spaces re-used for building materials, housing, industry, and burials. Gradually these spaces faded from view, buried beneath the medieval and modern city of Rome. A massive campaign of excavation in the twentieth century on the orders of the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini returned large areas of the <em>fora</em> to view. Ongoing archaeological investigation continues to reveal additional elements of the <em>fora</em> and to provide additional data that allow for their contextualization.</p>\n"

"<h3>Forum of Julius Caesar</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The Forum of Julius Caesar (also known as the<em> Forum Iulium</em> or <em>Forum Caesaris</em>) was the first of the imperial <em>fora </em>complexes to be built. Pompey the Great, a political rival of Caesar, had dedicated a monumental theater and portico complex in the Campus Martius in 55 B.C.E. and this perhaps spurred Caesar&rsquo;s ambition to construct a new forum complex. Caesar&rsquo;s project required the acquisition of land at the flank of the Capitoline Hill and he was aided in this early on by political allies, including Cicero, with the initial land purchased at a cost of sixty million sesterces (Cic. <em>ad Att</em>. 4.16.9).&nbsp;Additional land</span></p>\n"

"<p>The Forum of Augustus (known as the <em>Forum Augustum</em> or <em>Forum Augusti</em>) followed the Forum of Caesar as the second of the imperial <em>fora.</em>&nbsp; At the Battle of Philippi in 42 B.C.E.,&nbsp;Augustus vowed a temple to&nbsp;Mars in exchange for help in avenging the slain Caesar&nbsp;(Suet. <em>Aug</em>. 29.2), but the temple and forum complex would not be dedicated until 2 B.C.E. (<em>Res Gestae</em> 21).&nbsp;The Forum of Augustus provided additional room for the meeting of law courts and was built on land acquired by Augustus.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>To complete the narrative cycle, statues of famous Romans of the Republican period adorned the attic of the porticoes. These famous men (<em>summi viri</em>) were portrayed alongside small, inscribed plaques (<em>tituli</em>) bearing their political and military accomplishments. In this way, Augustus portrayed himself as the ideal man to lead the Roman state; he was&nbsp;connected to Rome&rsquo;s divine origins and he represented continuity with&nbsp;its republican tradition. This powerful&nbsp;visual narrative represents an important early use of public art to transmit ideological messages in the western world.</p>\n"

Pliny the Elder deemed the Forum of Augustus one of three most beautiful monuments in the city of Rome (Pliny the Elder <em>Natural History</em> 36.102.5).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Templum Pacis / Forum of Vespasian</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The next imperial forum to be built was commissioned by the emperor Vespasian following the suppression of the Great Jewish Revolt that lasted from 66 to 73 C.E. Vespasian came to power following civil chaos in 69 C.E. and, together with his eldest son, Titus, suppressed the revolt and sacked the city of Jerusalem. During the summer of 71 C.E. Vespasian and Titus jointly celebrated a lavish triumph at Rome&mdash;an ancient ritual celebrating significant military victories. One of the key tenets of Vespasian&rsquo;s new administration was the restoration of the city, including the construction of new buildings and monuments. He dedicated a forum complex that housed a temple dedicated to Peace (<em>Pax</em>) in 71 C.E., completing it by 75 C.E. (Flavius Josephus <em>Jewish War</em> 7.5.7). This innovative complex was deemed one of Rome&rsquo;s most beautiful monuments by Pliny the Elder and housed not only significant spoils from Jerusalem but also masterworks of Greek art that had previously been hoarded by the emperor Nero.</p>\n"

Rather than featuring a central temple seated atop a prominent podium, the Templum Pacis complex consists of a square portico (dimensions 110 x 135 m) with the temple itself set within the eastern side of the portico, flanked by ancillary rooms. This left the square itself open for the installation of decorative water features and plantings which are seen both archaeologically and on fragments of the Severan marble plan of the city of Rome (<em>forma urbis Romae</em>) that was mounted in the forum complex in the third century C.E. The fragments of the Severan plan provide valuable information about the design of this architectural complex and has led scholars to speculate that&nbsp;the inspiration for its design may have been the great market (<em>macellum magnum</em>) of the city that had likely been destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. It is especially significant to note that this is a public space and that Vespasian&rsquo;s generosity granted the populace of Rome access not only to a beautiful, monumental square, but also to art&nbsp;and the spoils of military&nbsp;victory (including spoils from the Temple in Jerusalem).</p>\n"

"<p>The Forum Transitorium, also referred to as the Forum of Nerva, was begun by Domitian, the younger son of Vespasian. Incomplete at the time of Domitian&rsquo;s assassination in 96 C.E., the complex was completed by Nerva in 97 C.E. This is a narrow forum complex that abuts both the Forum of Augustus and the Templum Pacis and is constrained by these pre-existing structures (dimensions: 131 x 45 meters); as well as&nbsp;the Argiletum, a&nbsp;street that ran the length of the forum. The Forum Transitorium&rsquo;s temple was sacred to Minerva, who had been a patron divinity of Domitian, and the architectural sculpture that decorated&nbsp;the porticoes featured&nbsp;imagery connected to Minerva and scenes from the private lives of women.</p>\n"

"<p>The Forum of Trajan (<em>Forum Traiani</em>), the final imperial forum, was both the largest and the most lavish. Inaugurated in 112 C.E., the architectural complex relied upon imposing architectural and sculptural features to glorify the accomplishments and principate&nbsp;of the emperor Trajan. The elaborate forum complex has a vast footprint, measuring 200 x 120 meters. The open square of the forum is flanked by porticoes that contain exedrae and point viewer attention toward the main structure, the massive Basilica Ulpia. The architect Apollodorus of Damascus was responsible for the innovative design. On the western side of the basilica was another courtyard, flanked by two libraries (one Greek and one Latin), that contained a monumental honorific column, known today as the Column of Trajan.</p>\n"

The column stands 38 meters tall and its frieze wraps around the column shaft 23 times, with a total length of roughly&nbsp;190 meters.

(<em>Historia Augusta - Hadrian</em> 19.9). An ongoing point of scholarly contention is the position and appearance of this plan. Traditional reconstructions favor a free-standing temple at the western end of the forum, while more recent reconstructions instead favor a shrine positioned against the western exedra of the Forum of Augustus. Ongoing archaeological fieldwork may yet shed light on this contentious topographical debate.</p>\n"

"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> represent important architectural landscapes in the city of Rome. They demonstrate the efficacy of public art and architecture with respect to creating collective identity and communicating clear&nbsp;messages that both disseminate and reinforce ideology. The strength and accomplishments of the Roman state, not to mention its stability, are key&nbsp;themes in any such program of message making. We should also not underestimate the psychological effect of these grandiose, soaring, bedecked complexes,&nbsp;based around massive open plazas,&nbsp;on the minds and experiences of city dwellers (many of whom lived in crowded squalor). The Imperial <em>fora</em> demonstrate that within the mechanisms of Roman urbanism, civic architecture occupies a crucial role. We are reminded of this efficacy by an ancient example that is perhaps no different from the reaction of a modern visitor to the city of Rome. The emperor Constantius II, visiting Rome in the mid-fourth century C.E., was amazed by the Forum of Trajan, something he considered &ldquo;a construction unique under the heavens&rdquo; (Ammianus Marcellinus 16.10.15).</p>\n"

"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> are located in an area bounded on the southwest by the Capitoline Hill, on the northeast by the Quirinal Hill, and extending toward the Esquiline Hill to the east. The <em>fora</em> were initially built between c. 54 B.C.E. and 113 C.E., with continuing additions, restorations, and modifications through late antiquity. In the middle ages the <em>fora</em> were spaces re-used for building materials, housing, industry, and burials. Gradually these spaces faded from view, buried beneath the medieval and modern city of Rome. A massive campaign of excavation in the twentieth century on the orders of the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini returned large areas of the <em>fora</em> to view. Ongoing archaeological investigation continues to reveal additional elements of the <em>fora</em> and to provide additional data that allow for their contextualization.</p>\n"

"<p><span>The Forum of Julius Caesar (also known as the<em> Forum Iulium</em> or <em>Forum Caesaris</em>) was the first of the imperial <em>fora </em>complexes to be built. Pompey the Great, a political rival of Caesar, had dedicated a monumental theater and portico complex in the Campus Martius in 55 B.C.E. and this perhaps spurred Caesar&rsquo;s ambition to construct a new forum complex. Caesar&rsquo;s project required the acquisition of land at the flank of the Capitoline Hill and he was aided in this early on by political allies, including Cicero, with the initial land purchased at a cost of sixty million sesterces (Cic. <em>ad Att</em>. 4.16.9).&nbsp;Additional land</span></p>\n"

"<p>To complete the narrative cycle, statues of famous Romans of the Republican period adorned the attic of the porticoes. These famous men (<em>summi viri</em>) were portrayed alongside small, inscribed plaques (<em>tituli</em>) bearing their political and military accomplishments. In this way, Augustus portrayed himself as the ideal man to lead the Roman state; he was&nbsp;connected to Rome&rsquo;s divine origins and he represented continuity with&nbsp;its republican tradition. This powerful&nbsp;visual narrative represents an important early use of public art to transmit ideological messages in the western world.</p>\n"

The emperor Tiberius added two arches in 19 C.E. meant to honor the German victories of Drusus and Germanicus (Tacitus<em> Annales</em> 2.64; <em>CIL</em> 6.911) and the emperor Hadrian restored the forum complex in the second century. Pliny the Elder deemed the Forum of Augustus one of three most beautiful monuments in the city of Rome (Pliny the Elder <em>Natural History</em> 36.102.5).</p>\n"

"<h3>Templum Pacis / Forum of Vespasian</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The next imperial forum to be built was commissioned by the emperor Vespasian following the suppression of the Great Jewish Revolt that lasted from 66 to 73 C.E. Vespasian came to power following civil chaos in 69 C.E. and, together with his eldest son, Titus, suppressed the revolt and sacked the city of Jerusalem. During the summer of 71 C.E. Vespasian and Titus jointly celebrated a lavish triumph at Rome&mdash;an ancient ritual celebrating significant military victories. One of the key tenets of Vespasian&rsquo;s new administration was the restoration of the city, including the construction of new buildings and monuments. He dedicated a forum complex that housed a temple dedicated to Peace (<em>Pax</em>) in 71 C.E., completing it by 75 C.E. (Flavius Josephus <em>Jewish War</em> 7.5.7). This innovative complex was deemed one of Rome&rsquo;s most beautiful monuments by Pliny the Elder and housed not only significant spoils from Jerusalem but also masterworks of Greek art that had previously been hoarded by the emperor Nero.</p>\n"

Rather than featuring a central temple seated atop a prominent podium, the Templum Pacis complex consists of a square portico (dimensions 110 x 135 m) with the temple itself set within the eastern side of the portico, flanked by ancillary rooms. This left the square itself open for the installation of decorative water features and plantings which are seen both archaeologically and on fragments of the Severan marble plan of the city of Rome (<em>forma urbis Romae</em>) that was mounted in the forum complex in the third century C.E. The fragments of the Severan plan provide valuable information about the design of this architectural complex and has led scholars to speculate that&nbsp;the inspiration for its design may have been the great market (<em>macellum magnum</em>) of the city that had likely been destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. It is especially significant to note that this is a public space and that Vespasian&rsquo;s generosity granted the populace of Rome access not only to a beautiful, monumental square, but also to art&nbsp;and the spoils of military&nbsp;victory (including spoils from the Temple in Jerusalem).</p>\n"

"<h3>Forum Transitorium</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Forum Transitorium, also referred to as the Forum of Nerva, was begun by Domitian, the younger son of Vespasian. Incomplete at the time of Domitian&rsquo;s assassination in 96 C.E., the complex was completed by Nerva in 97 C.E. This is a narrow forum complex that abuts both the Forum of Augustus and the Templum Pacis and is constrained by these pre-existing structures (dimensions: 131 x 45 meters); as well as&nbsp;the Argiletum, a&nbsp;street that ran the length of the forum. The Forum Transitorium&rsquo;s temple was sacred to Minerva, who had been a patron divinity of Domitian, and the architectural sculpture that decorated&nbsp;the porticoes featured&nbsp;imagery connected to Minerva and scenes from the private lives of women.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Forum of Trajan (<em>Forum Traiani</em>), the final imperial forum, was both the largest and the most lavish. Inaugurated in 112 C.E., the architectural complex relied upon imposing architectural and sculptural features to glorify the accomplishments and principate&nbsp;of the emperor Trajan. The elaborate forum complex has a vast footprint, measuring 200 x 120 meters. The open square of the forum is flanked by porticoes that contain exedrae and point viewer attention toward the main structure, the massive Basilica Ulpia. The architect Apollodorus of Damascus was responsible for the innovative design. On the western side of the basilica was another courtyard, flanked by two libraries (one Greek and one Latin), that contained a monumental honorific column, known today as the Column of Trajan.</p>\n"

The column stands 38 meters tall and its frieze wraps around the column shaft 23 times, with a total length of roughly&nbsp;190 meters. Carved in bas relief, the exquisite frieze carefully narrates Trajan&rsquo;s campaigns and its level of detail is simply astounding.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The column&rsquo;s frieze may draw inspiration from earlier Roman triumphal art, the tradition of which was inclined to depict scenes from the foreign campaigns and, in so doing, glorify the accomplishments of the commander and his soldiers.

(<em>Historia Augusta - Hadrian</em> 19.9). An ongoing point of scholarly contention is the position and appearance of this plan. Traditional reconstructions favor a free-standing temple at the western end of the forum, while more recent reconstructions instead favor a shrine positioned against the western exedra of the Forum of Augustus. Ongoing archaeological fieldwork may yet shed light on this contentious topographical debate.</p>\n"

"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> represent important architectural landscapes in the city of Rome. They demonstrate the efficacy of public art and architecture with respect to creating collective identity and communicating clear&nbsp;messages that both disseminate and reinforce ideology. The strength and accomplishments of the Roman state, not to mention its stability, are key&nbsp;themes in any such program of message making. We should also not underestimate the psychological effect of these grandiose, soaring, bedecked complexes,&nbsp;based around massive open plazas,&nbsp;on the minds and experiences of city dwellers (many of whom lived in crowded squalor). The Imperial <em>fora</em> demonstrate that within the mechanisms of Roman urbanism, civic architecture occupies a crucial role. We are reminded of this efficacy by an ancient example that is perhaps no different from the reaction of a modern visitor to the city of Rome. The emperor Constantius II, visiting Rome in the mid-fourth century C.E., was amazed by the Forum of Trajan, something he considered &ldquo;a construction unique under the heavens&rdquo; (Ammianus Marcellinus 16.10.15).</p>\n"

"<h3>Siena: a&nbsp;city overlooked?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries, Siena&rsquo;s role in the history of European art was underappreciated. This is partly because its moment of greatest influence occurred just before the Renaissance, a period commonly associated with the nearby city of Florence (both Florence and Siena were independent city-states in Italy at this time&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.sheltonstate.edu/Uploads/files/faculty/Chuck%20Boening/western%20civ/Renaissance%20Italy.jpg\">see this map</a>). But history&mdash;even art history&mdash;is written by the victors. So when Siena&rsquo;s position of power faded while Florence remained one of the financial and artistic centers of Europe, the achievements of Sienese artists slid slowly into the background. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians now know that the development of style in these two city-states was closely intertwined. The artists of one inevitably influenced the other, even in later periods. It is not an exaggeration to say that, at the height of its artistic flourishing, Siena was unsurpassed in its fame for producing celebrated painters.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Siena Cathedral\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b237edd2e759bf9e1024086c0378de2f3d2a4976.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Siena Cathedral</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An international city</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the early fourteenth century, Siena was a wealthy and cosmopolitan city. Several large international banks were run by wealthy Sienese families. Merchants based in Siena traded goods in several foreign countries, particularly France. The city&rsquo;s location on the Via Francigena, the main pilgrimage route to Rome, meant that pilgrims from all over Europe streamed through its streets. These pilgrims would have been greeted by one of the most impressive cityscapes in Italy at the time. Spread out over three hills, the skyline was dominated by the enormous cathedral and by the central seat of government, the Palazzo Pubblico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. \n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e3e30f4c7f901c8865774bea7bdae8ad4a3aa9a4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Communal oversight of the arts&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many cities today, the Sienese were acutely aware of how art and architecture shaped the city&rsquo;s identity in the eyes of both natives and visitors. The communal government was controlled by the &ldquo;Nove,&rdquo; or the Nine, a rotating group of representatives chosen from the city&rsquo;s leading families. The Nove dominated art patronage during the period, helping to decide the layout of the city and its largest buildings, selecting committees to oversee large public projects, and subsidizing the decoration of churches.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sienese art of the period was communally oriented in a few other ways. The central government and various churches hired local Sienese artists, almost exclusively, to produce the most important paintings. Such a preference for native sons hints at a general pride in the city&rsquo;s painters, known throughout Italy for the quality of their work (this was not the case with sculpture). There were also a few examples of large works of art created for private individuals. Compare this to Florence at the time, where rich citizens often bought the right to decorate family chapels in large churches and where painters from other cities were sometimes awarded prestigious commissions.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Duccio di Buoninsegna, The Rucellai Madonna, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence)  \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46b0b58a512e4a121a52252828059ed9db2d6299.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio di Buoninsegna,&nbsp;<em>Rucellai Madonna</em>, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>In fact, the most famous Sienese artist of the fourteenth century may have first made a name for himself in Florence. The earliest recorded work by Duccio, an artist who is often called the father of Sienese painting, was commissioned for the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This nearly fifteen-foot tall altarpiece depicting the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child introduced Duccio&rsquo;s innovative style to a wider audience. Like previous artists, Duccio was interested in creating beautiful patterns and shapes. We can see the love of surface decoration in the undulating arrangements of fabric or even in the faces of his figures. Yet he also used soft modeling with light and shade to give a sense of mass in the figures&rsquo; delicate but real bodies.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Duccio&rsquo;s ability to combine elegant lines and patterns with a fragile naturalism became a hallmark of Sienese painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Duccio, Maesta (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0994300bbf1aa960593705d69939bb15e6fd9a15.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio, <em>Maesta</em> (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell&#39;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Maest&agrave;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Santa Maria Novella altarpiece must have won Duccio fame in his own city of Siena, for he soon became a favorite painter of the commune. In 1308, he was asked to create a massive painting for the main altar in the middle of the Cathedral. The front of the altarpiece depicted the Madonna and Child sitting on a throne and surrounded by saints and angels, a subject known in Italian as a Maest&agrave;. Originally, the main scene was at the center of a set of stories and figures, all united in an elaborate wooden structure of frames covered in gold leaf. The back of the altarpiece was painted with a series of scenes from the life of Christ. Unfortunately, these panels are now dispersed in many museums. In these panels, Duccio demonstrated his unsurpassed skills of visual storytelling, capturing the imagination of contemporary viewers with his vivid depictions of the gospel stories that were so central to the faith of Siena and its visitors.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Cathedral altarpieces&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is hard to overestimate how important Duccio&rsquo;s altarpiece was for the citizens who worshiped in front of it and for the artists who studied it. The city had long ago dedicated itself to the Virgin Mary, believing her to be their special protector. In an age where painted images gave faithful viewers a channel of access to celestial figures, the Maest&agrave; became the central representation of Siena&rsquo;s powerful patron as the queen of heaven.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work&rsquo;s role as a devotional and artistic well for the city was most eloquently honored in four altarpieces painted for the chapels surrounding Duccio&rsquo;s painting. Each altarpiece depicted a scene involving Mary, so that the story of her life would have unfolded as your eye travelled along the chapels. Over the course of two decades, one altarpiece was commissioned from each of the leading Sienese painters of the day, transforming the heart of the Cathedral into something like a gallery of the great Sienese artists. This is a perfect illustration of the city&rsquo;s tendency to blend devotional piety and civic pride in large artistic projects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" Simone Martini, The Annunciation, 1333, tempera on panel, 72 1/2 x 82 5/8&quot; or 184 x 210 cm.

"\n"
"<h3>Simone Martini</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the best known of these four altarpieces is the Annunciation by Simone Martini. Building on the legacy of Duccio, Simone was also influenced by the elongated, swaying figures and elaborate architectural forms of northern European art. On the other hand, his paintings show a bit more of the kind of careful observation of the world around him that we might associate with Giotto, the leading Florentine artist at the time. Thanks to this eclectic but refined mixing of new styles, Simone&rsquo;s reputation and influence spread throughout Europe, a legacy carried on by a large workshop of assistants and students.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Lorenzetti brothers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two of the other three artists hired to paint altarpieces behind the Maest&agrave; were actually brothers: Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. While the Lorenzetti brothers worked in the Sienese style, they absorbed the art of Giotto more fully than Simone Martini and his followers did. Weighty, massive figures covered in heavy drapery populate their works, a sure sign of their familiarity with Florentine painting. Even more than Giotto and his school, both Ambrogio and Pietro experimented with using different kinds of perspective to give an illusion of depth in the spaces their figures occupy.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Good and Bad Government&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ambrogio Lorenzetti&rsquo;s artistic innovation is best captured in one of the most groundbreaking works of the late medieval period: his wall paintings in the Palazzo Pubblico. The elaborate murals were designed to remind the Nove of the consequences of good and bad governance. The scenes are particularly known for their large, sensitively depicted landscapes and cityscapes. No other monumental celebration of everyday urban and rural life survives from the period, making these scenes a turning point in the history of art.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Siena: a&nbsp;city overlooked?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries, Siena&rsquo;s role in the history of European art was underappreciated. This is partly because its moment of greatest influence occurred just before the Renaissance, a period commonly associated with the nearby city of Florence (both Florence and Siena were independent city-states in Italy at this time&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.sheltonstate.edu/Uploads/files/faculty/Chuck%20Boening/western%20civ/Renaissance%20Italy.jpg\">see this map</a>). But history&mdash;even art history&mdash;is written by the victors. So when Siena&rsquo;s position of power faded while Florence remained one of the financial and artistic centers of Europe, the achievements of Sienese artists slid slowly into the background. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians now know that the development of style in these two city-states was closely intertwined. The artists of one inevitably influenced the other, even in later periods. It is not an exaggeration to say that, at the height of its artistic flourishing, Siena was unsurpassed in its fame for producing celebrated painters.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Siena Cathedral\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b237edd2e759bf9e1024086c0378de2f3d2a4976.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Siena Cathedral</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An international city</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the early fourteenth century, Siena was a wealthy and cosmopolitan city. Several large international banks were run by wealthy Sienese families. Merchants based in Siena traded goods in several foreign countries, particularly France. The city&rsquo;s location on the Via Francigena, the main pilgrimage route to Rome, meant that pilgrims from all over Europe streamed through its streets. These pilgrims would have been greeted by one of the most impressive cityscapes in Italy at the time. Spread out over three hills, the skyline was dominated by the enormous cathedral and by the central seat of government, the Palazzo Pubblico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. \n"

"\n"
"<h3>Communal oversight of the arts&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many cities today, the Sienese were acutely aware of how art and architecture shaped the city&rsquo;s identity in the eyes of both natives and visitors. The communal government was controlled by the &ldquo;Nove,&rdquo; or the Nine, a rotating group of representatives chosen from the city&rsquo;s leading families. The Nove dominated art patronage during the period, helping to decide the layout of the city and its largest buildings, selecting committees to oversee large public projects, and subsidizing the decoration of churches.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sienese art of the period was communally oriented in a few other ways. The central government and various churches hired local Sienese artists, almost exclusively, to produce the most important paintings. Such a preference for native sons hints at a general pride in the city&rsquo;s painters, known throughout Italy for the quality of their work (this was not the case with sculpture). There were also a few examples of large works of art created for private individuals. Compare this to Florence at the time, where rich citizens often bought the right to decorate family chapels in large churches and where painters from other cities were sometimes awarded prestigious commissions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Duccio</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Duccio di Buoninsegna, The Rucellai Madonna, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence)  \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46b0b58a512e4a121a52252828059ed9db2d6299.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio di Buoninsegna,&nbsp;<em>Rucellai Madonna</em>, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>In fact, the most famous Sienese artist of the fourteenth century may have first made a name for himself in Florence. The earliest recorded work by Duccio, an artist who is often called the father of Sienese painting, was commissioned for the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This nearly fifteen-foot tall altarpiece depicting the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child introduced Duccio&rsquo;s innovative style to a wider audience. Like previous artists, Duccio was interested in creating beautiful patterns and shapes. We can see the love of surface decoration in the undulating arrangements of fabric or even in the faces of his figures. Yet he also used soft modeling with light and shade to give a sense of mass in the figures&rsquo; delicate but real bodies.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Duccio&rsquo;s ability to combine elegant lines and patterns with a fragile naturalism became a hallmark of Sienese painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Duccio, Maesta (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0994300bbf1aa960593705d69939bb15e6fd9a15.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio, <em>Maesta</em> (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell&#39;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Maest&agrave;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Santa Maria Novella altarpiece must have won Duccio fame in his own city of Siena, for he soon became a favorite painter of the commune. In 1308, he was asked to create a massive painting for the main altar in the middle of the Cathedral. The front of the altarpiece depicted the Madonna and Child sitting on a throne and surrounded by saints and angels, a subject known in Italian as a Maest&agrave;. Originally, the main scene was at the center of a set of stories and figures, all united in an elaborate wooden structure of frames covered in gold leaf. The back of the altarpiece was painted with a series of scenes from the life of Christ. Unfortunately, these panels are now dispersed in many museums. In these panels, Duccio demonstrated his unsurpassed skills of visual storytelling, capturing the imagination of contemporary viewers with his vivid depictions of the gospel stories that were so central to the faith of Siena and its visitors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Duccio, Maesta (reconstruction of back), 1308-11 (Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena)  \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/de9fbb61a91fcaa94122878011171960ef75e8ac.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio, Maesta (reconstruction of back), 1308-11 (Museo dell&#39;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Cathedral altarpieces&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is hard to overestimate how important Duccio&rsquo;s altarpiece was for the citizens who worshiped in front of it and for the artists who studied it. The city had long ago dedicated itself to the Virgin Mary, believing her to be their special protector. In an age where painted images gave faithful viewers a channel of access to celestial figures, the Maest&agrave; became the central representation of Siena&rsquo;s powerful patron as the queen of heaven.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work&rsquo;s role as a devotional and artistic well for the city was most eloquently honored in four altarpieces painted for the chapels surrounding Duccio&rsquo;s painting. Each altarpiece depicted a scene involving Mary, so that the story of her life would have unfolded as your eye travelled along the chapels. Over the course of two decades, one altarpiece was commissioned from each of the leading Sienese painters of the day, transforming the heart of the Cathedral into something like a gallery of the great Sienese artists. This is a perfect illustration of the city&rsquo;s tendency to blend devotional piety and civic pride in large artistic projects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" Simone Martini, The Annunciation, 1333, tempera on panel, 72 1/2 x 82 5/8&quot; or 184 x 210 cm.

(Uffizi, Florence) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Simone Martini</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the best known of these four altarpieces is the Annunciation by Simone Martini. Building on the legacy of Duccio, Simone was also influenced by the elongated, swaying figures and elaborate architectural forms of northern European art. On the other hand, his paintings show a bit more of the kind of careful observation of the world around him that we might associate with Giotto, the leading Florentine artist at the time. Thanks to this eclectic but refined mixing of new styles, Simone&rsquo;s reputation and influence spread throughout Europe, a legacy carried on by a large workshop of assistants and students.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Lorenzetti brothers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two of the other three artists hired to paint altarpieces behind the Maest&agrave; were actually brothers: Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. While the Lorenzetti brothers worked in the Sienese style, they absorbed the art of Giotto more fully than Simone Martini and his followers did. Weighty, massive figures covered in heavy drapery populate their works, a sure sign of their familiarity with Florentine painting. Even more than Giotto and his school, both Ambrogio and Pietro experimented with using different kinds of perspective to give an illusion of depth in the spaces their figures occupy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3d785182974044d37bee333c1a8e5fa8d88b2b8a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"> Ambrogio Lorenzetti, detail from Allegory of Good Government, Effects of Good Government in the City and the Country, c. 1337-40, fresco, Sala della Pace (Hall of Peace) also known as the Sala dei Nove (the Hall of the Nine), 7.7 x 14.4 meters (room), Palazzo Pubblico, Siena</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Good and Bad Government&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ambrogio Lorenzetti&rsquo;s artistic innovation is best captured in one of the most groundbreaking works of the late medieval period: his wall paintings in the Palazzo Pubblico. The elaborate murals were designed to remind the Nove of the consequences of good and bad governance. The scenes are particularly known for their large, sensitively depicted landscapes and cityscapes. No other monumental celebration of everyday urban and rural life survives from the period, making these scenes a turning point in the history of art.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>After the Black Death</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As in Florence, perhaps half of Siena&rsquo;s population died of the plague in 1348. Scholars think the Lorenzetti brothers were two of the Black Death&rsquo;s victims.

"<h3><span>Roman Art: When and Where</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman art is a very broad topic, spanning almost 1,000 years and three continents, from Europe into Africa and Asia. The first Roman art can be dated back to 509 B.C.E., with the legendary founding of the Roman Republic, and lasted until 330 C.E. (or much longer, if you include Byzantine art). Roman art also encompasses a broad spectrum of media including marble, painting, mosaic, gems, silver and bronze work, and terracottas, just to name a few.&nbsp;The city of Rome was a melting pot, and the Romans had no qualms about adapting artistic influences from the other Mediterranean cultures that surrounded and preceded them. For this reason it is common to see Greek, Etruscan and Egyptian influences throughout Roman art. This is not to say that all of Roman art is derivative, though, and one of the challenges for specialists is to define what is &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; about Roman art. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Doryphoros (Spear Bearer) or Canon. Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6'6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/06527f2a9dc5663aef7b38bf6f87dd7673b31758.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Doryphoros (Spear Bearer)</em>,&nbsp;Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6&#39;6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples),&nbsp;photo: Steven Zucker (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>Greek art certainly had a powerful influence on Roman practice; the Roman poet Horace famously said that &ldquo;Greece, the captive, took her savage victor captive,&rdquo; meaning that Rome (though it conquered Greece) adapted much of Greece&rsquo;s cultural and artistic heritage (as well as importing many of its most famous works). &nbsp;It is also true that many Romans commissioned versions of famous Greek works from earlier centuries; this is why we often have marble versions of lost Greek bronzes such as the <em>Doryphoros</em>&nbsp;by Polykleitos. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The Romans did not believe, as we do today, that to have a copy of an artwork was of any less value that to have the original. The copies, however, were more often variations rather than direct copies, and they had small changes made to them. The variations could be made with humor, taking the serious and somber element of Greek art and turning it on its head. So, for example, a famously gruesome Hellenistic sculpture of the satyr Marsyas being flayed was converted in a Roman dining room to a knife handle (currently in the National Archaeological Museum in Perugia). A knife was the very element that would have been used to flay the poor satyr, demonstrating not only the owner&rsquo;s knowledge of Greek mythology and important statuary,&nbsp;but also a dark sense of humor. From the direct reporting of the Greeks to the utilitarian and humorous luxury item of a Roman enthusiast, Marsyas made quite the journey. But the Roman artist was not simply copying. He was also adapting in a conscious and brilliant way.&nbsp;It is precisely this ability to adapt, convert, combine elements and add a touch of humor that makes Roman art Roman.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Republican Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mythic founding of the Roman Republic is supposed to have happened in 509 B.C.E., when the last Etruscan king, Tarquinius Superbus, was overthrown. &nbsp;During the Republican period, the Romans were governed by annually elected magistrates, the two consuls being the most important among them, and the Senate, which was the ruling body of the state. Eventually the system broke down and civil wars ensued between 100 and 42 B.C.E. The wars were finally brought to an end when Octavian (later called Augustus) defeated Mark Antony in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Marble bust of a man, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropilitan Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6607b0e560cc3dc3cce42932492accc2e348bc40.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Marble bust of a man</em>, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropolitan Museum of Art)</span></span>In the Republican period, art was produced in the service of the state, depicting public sacrifices or celebrating victorious military campaigns (like the Monument of Aemilius Paullus at Delphi). Portraiture extolled the communal goals of the Republic; hard work, age, wisdom, being a community leader and soldier. &nbsp;Patrons chose to have themselves represented with balding heads, large noses, and extra wrinkles, demonstrating that they had spent their lives working for the Republic as model citizens, flaunting their acquired wisdom with each furrow of the brow. We now call this portrait style veristic, referring to the hyper-naturalistic features that emphasize every flaw, creating portraits of individuals with personality and essence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Imperial Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus&rsquo;s rise to power in Rome signaled the end of the Roman Republic and the formation of Imperial rule. Roman art was now put to the service of aggrandizing the ruler and his family. It was also meant to indicate shifts in leadership. The major periods in Imperial Roman art are named after individual rulers or major dynasties, they are:&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Imperial art often hearkened back to the Classical art of the past. &nbsp;&ldquo;Classical&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Classicizing,&rdquo;&nbsp;when used in reference to Roman art refers broadly to the influences of Greek art from the Classical and Hellenistic periods (480-31 B.C.E.). Classicizing elements include the smooth lines, elegant drapery, idealized nude bodies, highly naturalistic forms and balanced proportions that the Greeks had perfected over centuries of practice.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus and the Julio-Claudian dynasty were particularly fond of adapting Classical elements into their art. The <em>Augustus of Primaporta </em>was made at the end of Augustus&rsquo;s life, yet he is represented as youthful, idealized and strikingly handsome like a young athlete; all hallmarks of Classical art. The emperor Hadrian was known as a philhellene, or lover of all things Greek. The emperor himself began sporting a Greek &ldquo;philosopher&rsquo;s beard&rdquo; in his official portraiture, unheard of before this time. D&eacute;cor at his rambling Villa at Tivoli included mosaic copies of famous Greek paintings, such as <em>Battle of the Centaurs</em> <em>and Wild Beasts</em> by the legendary ancient Greek painter&nbsp;Zeuxis. &nbsp;</p>\n"

(Altes Museum, Berlin)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Later Imperial art moved away from earlier Classical influences, and Severan art signals the shift to art of Late Antiquity. The characteristics of Late Antique art include frontality, stiffness of pose and drapery, deeply drilled lines, less naturalism, squat proportions and lack of individualism. Important figures are often slightly larger or are placed above the rest of the crowd to denote importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>In relief panels from the <em>Arch of Septimius Severu</em>s from Lepcis Magna, Septimius Severus and his sons, Caracalla and Geta ride in a chariot, marking them out from an otherwise uniform sea of repeating figures, all wearing the same stylized and flat drapery. There is little variation or individualism in the figures and they are all stiff and carved with deep, full lines. There is an ease to reading the work; Septimius is centrally located, between his sons and slightly taller; all the other figures direct the viewer&rsquo;s eyes to him.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Tronchin (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Constantinian art continued to integrate the elements of Late Antiquity that had been introduced in the Severan period, but they are now developed even further. For example, on the oratio relief panel on the Arch of Constantine, the figures are even more squat, frontally oriented, similar to one another, and there is a clear lack of naturalism. Again, the message is meant to be understood without hesitation: Constantine is in power.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Who Made Roman Art?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about who made Roman art. &nbsp;Artists certainly existed in antiquity but we know very little about them, especially during the Roman period, because of a lack of documentary evidence such as contracts or letters. &nbsp;What evidence we do have, such as Pliny the Elder&rsquo;s <em>Natural History</em>, pays little attention to contemporary artists and often focuses more on the Greek artists of the past. &nbsp;As a result, scholars do not refer to specific artists but consider&nbsp;them generally, as a largely anonymous group.</p>\n"

"<p>Roman art encompasses private art made for Roman homes as well as art in the public sphere.

The arches and columns (like the Arch of Titus or the Column of Trajan), marked victories, depicted war, and described military life. They also revealed foreign lands and enemies of the state. They could also depict an emperor&rsquo;s successes in domestic and foreign policy rather than in war, such as Trajan&rsquo;s Arch in Benevento. Religious art is also included in this category, such as the cult statues placed in Roman temples that stood in for the deities they represented, like Venus or Jupiter. Gods and religions from other parts of the empire also made their way to Rome&rsquo;s capital&nbsp;including the Egyptian goddess Isis, the Persian god Mithras and ultimately Christianity.

"<h3><span>Roman Art: When and Where</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman art is a very broad topic, spanning almost 1,000 years and three continents, from Europe into Africa and Asia. The first Roman art can be dated back to 509 B.C.E., with the legendary founding of the Roman Republic, and lasted until 330 C.E. (or much longer, if you include Byzantine art). Roman art also encompasses a broad spectrum of media including marble, painting, mosaic, gems, silver and bronze work, and terracottas, just to name a few.&nbsp;The city of Rome was a melting pot, and the Romans had no qualms about adapting artistic influences from the other Mediterranean cultures that surrounded and preceded them. For this reason it is common to see Greek, Etruscan and Egyptian influences throughout Roman art. This is not to say that all of Roman art is derivative, though, and one of the challenges for specialists is to define what is &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; about Roman art. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Doryphoros (Spear Bearer) or Canon. Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6'6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/06527f2a9dc5663aef7b38bf6f87dd7673b31758.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Doryphoros (Spear Bearer)</em>,&nbsp;Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6&#39;6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples),&nbsp;photo: Steven Zucker (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>Greek art certainly had a powerful influence on Roman practice; the Roman poet Horace famously said that &ldquo;Greece, the captive, took her savage victor captive,&rdquo; meaning that Rome (though it conquered Greece) adapted much of Greece&rsquo;s cultural and artistic heritage (as well as importing many of its most famous works). &nbsp;It is also true that many Romans commissioned versions of famous Greek works from earlier centuries; this is why we often have marble versions of lost Greek bronzes such as the <em>Doryphoros</em>&nbsp;by Polykleitos. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The Romans did not believe, as we do today, that to have a copy of an artwork was of any less value that to have the original. The copies, however, were more often variations rather than direct copies, and they had small changes made to them. The variations could be made with humor, taking the serious and somber element of Greek art and turning it on its head. So, for example, a famously gruesome Hellenistic sculpture of the satyr Marsyas being flayed was converted in a Roman dining room to a knife handle (currently in the National Archaeological Museum in Perugia). A knife was the very element that would have been used to flay the poor satyr, demonstrating not only the owner&rsquo;s knowledge of Greek mythology and important statuary,&nbsp;but also a dark sense of humor. From the direct reporting of the Greeks to the utilitarian and humorous luxury item of a Roman enthusiast, Marsyas made quite the journey. But the Roman artist was not simply copying. He was also adapting in a conscious and brilliant way.&nbsp;It is precisely this ability to adapt, convert, combine elements and add a touch of humor that makes Roman art Roman.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Republican Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mythic founding of the Roman Republic is supposed to have happened in 509 B.C.E., when the last Etruscan king, Tarquinius Superbus, was overthrown. &nbsp;During the Republican period, the Romans were governed by annually elected magistrates, the two consuls being the most important among them, and the Senate, which was the ruling body of the state. Eventually the system broke down and civil wars ensued between 100 and 42 B.C.E. The wars were finally brought to an end when Octavian (later called Augustus) defeated Mark Antony in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Marble bust of a man, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropilitan Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6607b0e560cc3dc3cce42932492accc2e348bc40.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Marble bust of a man</em>, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropolitan Museum of Art)</span></span>In the Republican period, art was produced in the service of the state, depicting public sacrifices or celebrating victorious military campaigns (like the Monument of Aemilius Paullus at Delphi). Portraiture extolled the communal goals of the Republic; hard work, age, wisdom, being a community leader and soldier. &nbsp;Patrons chose to have themselves represented with balding heads, large noses, and extra wrinkles, demonstrating that they had spent their lives working for the Republic as model citizens, flaunting their acquired wisdom with each furrow of the brow. We now call this portrait style veristic, referring to the hyper-naturalistic features that emphasize every flaw, creating portraits of individuals with personality and essence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Imperial Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus&rsquo;s rise to power in Rome signaled the end of the Roman Republic and the formation of Imperial rule. Roman art was now put to the service of aggrandizing the ruler and his family. It was also meant to indicate shifts in leadership. The major periods in Imperial Roman art are named after individual rulers or major dynasties, they are:&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Imperial art often hearkened back to the Classical art of the past. &nbsp;&ldquo;Classical&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Classicizing,&rdquo;&nbsp;when used in reference to Roman art refers broadly to the influences of Greek art from the Classical and Hellenistic periods (480-31 B.C.E.). Classicizing elements include the smooth lines, elegant drapery, idealized nude bodies, highly naturalistic forms and balanced proportions that the Greeks had perfected over centuries of practice.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus and the Julio-Claudian dynasty were particularly fond of adapting Classical elements into their art. The <em>Augustus of Primaporta </em>was made at the end of Augustus&rsquo;s life, yet he is represented as youthful, idealized and strikingly handsome like a young athlete; all hallmarks of Classical art. The emperor Hadrian was known as a philhellene, or lover of all things Greek. The emperor himself began sporting a Greek &ldquo;philosopher&rsquo;s beard&rdquo; in his official portraiture, unheard of before this time. D&eacute;cor at his rambling Villa at Tivoli included mosaic copies of famous Greek paintings, such as <em>Battle of the Centaurs</em> <em>and Wild Beasts</em> by the legendary ancient Greek painter&nbsp;Zeuxis. &nbsp;</p>\n"

(Altes Museum, Berlin)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Later Imperial art moved away from earlier Classical influences, and Severan art signals the shift to art of Late Antiquity. The characteristics of Late Antique art include frontality, stiffness of pose and drapery, deeply drilled lines, less naturalism, squat proportions and lack of individualism. Important figures are often slightly larger or are placed above the rest of the crowd to denote importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>In relief panels from the <em>Arch of Septimius Severu</em>s from Lepcis Magna, Septimius Severus and his sons, Caracalla and Geta ride in a chariot, marking them out from an otherwise uniform sea of repeating figures, all wearing the same stylized and flat drapery. There is little variation or individualism in the figures and they are all stiff and carved with deep, full lines. There is an ease to reading the work; Septimius is centrally located, between his sons and slightly taller; all the other figures direct the viewer&rsquo;s eyes to him.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Tronchin (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Constantinian art continued to integrate the elements of Late Antiquity that had been introduced in the Severan period, but they are now developed even further. For example, on the oratio relief panel on the Arch of Constantine, the figures are even more squat, frontally oriented, similar to one another, and there is a clear lack of naturalism. Again, the message is meant to be understood without hesitation: Constantine is in power.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Who Made Roman Art?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about who made Roman art. &nbsp;Artists certainly existed in antiquity but we know very little about them, especially during the Roman period, because of a lack of documentary evidence such as contracts or letters. &nbsp;What evidence we do have, such as Pliny the Elder&rsquo;s <em>Natural History</em>, pays little attention to contemporary artists and often focuses more on the Greek artists of the past. &nbsp;As a result, scholars do not refer to specific artists but considers them generally, as a largely anonymous group.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Easter Island is famous for its stone statues of human figures, known as <em>moai</em>&nbsp;(meaning &ldquo;statue&rdquo;). The island is known to its inhabitants as Rapa Nui.&nbsp;The <em>moai</em> were probably carved to commemorate important ancestors and were made from around 1000 C.E. until the second half of the seventeenth century.&nbsp;Over a few hundred years the inhabitants of this remote island quarried, carved and erected around 887 <em>moai</em>.&nbsp;The size and complexity of the moai increased over time, and it is believed that <em>Hoa Hakananai&#39;a</em>&nbsp;(below) dates to around 1200 C.E. It is one of only fourteen moai made from basalt, the rest are carved from the island&rsquo;s softer volcanic tuff.&nbsp;With the adoption of Christianity in the 1860s, the remaining standing <em>moai</em> were toppled.<br />\n"

Its eyes sockets were originally inlaid with red stone and coral and the sculpture was painted with red and white designs, which were washed off when it was rafted to the ship, to be taken to Europe in 1869.&nbsp;It was collected by the crew of the English ship HMS Topaze, under the command of Richard Ashmore Powell, on their visit to Easter Island in 1868 to carry out surveying work.&nbsp;Islanders helped the crew to move the statue, which has been estimated to weigh around four tons.

"<h3>The&nbsp;<em>moai</em> of&nbsp;Rapa Nui</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Easter Island is famous for its stone statues of human figures, known as <em>moai</em>&nbsp;(meaning &ldquo;statue&rdquo;). The island is known to its inhabitants as Rapa Nui.&nbsp;The <em>moai</em> were probably carved to commemorate important ancestors and were made from around 1000 C.E. until the second half of the seventeenth century.&nbsp;Over a few hundred years the inhabitants of this remote island quarried, carved and erected around 887 <em>moai</em>.&nbsp;The size and complexity of the moai increased over time, and it is believed that <em>Hoa Hakananai&#39;a</em>&nbsp;(below) dates to around 1200 C.E. It is one of only fourteen moai made from basalt, the rest are carved from the island&rsquo;s softer volcanic tuff.&nbsp;With the adoption of Christianity in the 1860s, the remaining standing <em>moai</em> were toppled.<br />\n"

It would have stood with giant stone companions, their backs to the sea, keeping watch over the island. Its eyes sockets were originally inlaid with red stone and coral and the sculpture was painted with red and white designs, which were washed off when it was rafted to the ship, to be taken to Europe in 1869.&nbsp;It was collected by the crew of the English ship HMS Topaze, under the command of Richard Ashmore Powell, on their visit to Easter Island in 1868 to carry out surveying work.&nbsp;Islanders helped the crew to move the statue, which has been estimated to weigh around four tons. It was moved to the beach and then taken to the Topaze by raft.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"<h3>A rare night landscape</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The curving, swirling lines of hills, mountains, and sky, the brilliantly contrasting blues and yellows, the large, flame-like cypress trees, and the thickly layered brushstrokes of Vincent van Gogh&rsquo;s<em> The Starry Night</em> are engrained in the minds of many as an expression of the artist&rsquo;s turbulent state-of-mind. Van Gogh&rsquo;s canvas is indeed an exceptional work of art, not only in terms of its quality but also within the artist&rsquo;s oeuvre, since in comparison to favored subjects like irises, sunflowers, or wheat fields, night landscapes are rare. Nevertheless, it is surprising that <em>The Starry Night</em> has become so well known. Van Gogh mentioned it briefly in his letters as a simple &ldquo;study of night&rdquo; or &rdquo;night effect.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>His &nbsp;brother Theo, manager of a Parisian art gallery and a gifted connoisseur of contemporary art, was unimpressed, telling Vincent, &ldquo;I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight&hellip; but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things&rdquo; (813, 22 October 1889). Although Theo Van Gogh felt that the painting ultimately pushed style too far at the expense of true emotive substance, the work has become iconic of individualized expression in modern landscape painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/17735bb9ce7ba89b5fa2dc8eb2f19588069b7c83.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Vincent van Gogh, <em>Starry Night over the Rhone</em>,1888, oil on canvas, 72 x 92 cm (Mus&eacute;e d&#39;Orsay)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Technical challenges&nbsp;</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Van Gogh had had the subject of a blue night sky dotted with yellow stars in mind for many months before he painted <em>The Starry Night</em> in late June or early July of 1889. It presented a few technical challenges he wished to confront&mdash;namely the use of contrasting color and the complications of painting en plein air (outdoors) at night&mdash;and he referenced it repeatedly in letters to family and friends as a promising if problematic theme. &ldquo;A starry sky, for example, well &ndash; it&rsquo;s a thing that I&rsquo;d like to try to do,&rdquo; Van Gogh confessed to the painter Emile Bernard in the spring of 1888, &ldquo;but how to arrive at that unless I decide to work at home and from the imagination?&rdquo; (596, 12 April 1888).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As an artist devoted to working whenever possible from prints and illustrations or outside in front of the landscape he was depicting, the idea of painting an invented scene from imagination troubled Van Gogh. When he did paint a first example of the full night sky in <em>Starry Night over the Rh&ocirc;ne</em> (1888, oil on canvas, 72.5 x 92 cm, Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay, Paris), an image of the French city of Arles at night, the work was completed outdoors with the help of gas lamplight, but evidence suggests that his second Starry Night was created largely if not exclusively in the studio. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Location</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Following the dramatic end to his short-lived collaboration with the painter Paul Gauguin in Arles in 1888 and the infamous breakdown during which he mutilated part of his own ear, Van Gogh was ultimately hospitalized at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, an asylum and clinic for the mentally ill near the village of Saint-R&eacute;my. During his convalescence there, Van Gogh was encouraged to paint, though he rarely ventured more than a few hundred yards from the asylum&rsquo;s walls.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3c39274a1a4ab3b3466156a8244a8a3ab420133a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Saint-Paul-de-Mausole near&nbsp;Saint-R&eacute;my, France (photo: <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abtei_Saint-Paul-de-Mausole#mediaviewer/File:Chevet_de_Saint-Paul_de_Mausole.JPG\">Emdee</a> CC BY-SA 3.0)</span></span></p>\n"

(The Museum of Modern Art, New York)</span></span><br />\n"
"Besides his private room, from which he had a sweeping view of the mountain range of the Alpilles, he was also given a small studio for painting. Since this room did not look out upon the mountains but rather had a view of the asylum&rsquo;s garden, it is assumed that Van Gogh composed <em>The Starry Night</em> using elements of a few previously completed works still stored in his studio, as well as aspects from imagination and memory. It has even been argued that the church&rsquo;s spire in the village is somehow more Dutch in character and must have been painted as an amalgamation of several different&nbsp;church spires that Van Gogh had depicted years earlier while living in the Netherlands.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Van Gogh also understood the painting to be an exercise in deliberate stylization, telling his brother, &ldquo;These are exaggerations from the point of view of arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of ancient woodcuts&rdquo; (805, c. 20 September 1889). Similar to his friends Bernard and Gauguin, Van Gogh was experimenting with a style inspired in part by medieval woodcuts, with their thick outlines and simplified forms.</p>\n"

"<h3>A rare night landscape</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The curving, swirling lines of hills, mountains, and sky, the brilliantly contrasting blues and yellows, the large, flame-like cypress trees, and the thickly layered brushstrokes of Vincent van Gogh&rsquo;s<em> The Starry Night</em> are engrained in the minds of many as an expression of the artist&rsquo;s turbulent state-of-mind. Van Gogh&rsquo;s canvas is indeed an exceptional work of art, not only in terms of its quality but also within the artist&rsquo;s oeuvre, since in comparison to favored subjects like irises, sunflowers, or wheat fields, night landscapes are rare. Nevertheless, it is surprising that <em>The Starry Night</em> has become so well known. Van Gogh mentioned it briefly in his letters as a simple &ldquo;study of night&rdquo; or &rdquo;night effect.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>His &nbsp;brother Theo, manager of a Parisian art gallery and a gifted connoisseur of contemporary art, was unimpressed, telling Vincent, &ldquo;I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight&hellip; but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things&rdquo; (813, 22 October 1889). Although Theo Van Gogh felt that the painting ultimately pushed style too far at the expense of true emotive substance, the work has become iconic of individualized expression in modern landscape painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>Technical challenges&nbsp;</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Van Gogh had had the subject of a blue night sky dotted with yellow stars in mind for many months before he painted <em>The Starry Night</em> in late June or early July of 1889. It presented a few technical challenges he wished to confront&mdash;namely the use of contrasting color and the complications of painting en plein air (outdoors) at night&mdash;and he referenced it repeatedly in letters to family and friends as a promising if problematic theme. &ldquo;A starry sky, for example, well &ndash; it&rsquo;s a thing that I&rsquo;d like to try to do,&rdquo; Van Gogh confessed to the painter Emile Bernard in the spring of 1888, &ldquo;but how to arrive at that unless I decide to work at home and from the imagination?&rdquo; (596, 12 April 1888).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As an artist devoted to working whenever possible from prints and illustrations or outside in front of the landscape he was depicting, the idea of painting an invented scene from imagination troubled Van Gogh. When he did paint a first example of the full night sky in <em>Starry Night over the Rh&ocirc;ne</em> (1888, oil on canvas, 72.5 x 92 cm, Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay, Paris), an image of the French city of Arles at night, the work was completed outdoors with the help of gas lamplight, but evidence suggests that his second Starry Night was created largely if not exclusively in the studio. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>場所</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Following the dramatic end to his short-lived collaboration with the painter Paul Gauguin in Arles in 1888 and the infamous breakdown during which he mutilated part of his own ear, Van Gogh was ultimately hospitalized at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, an asylum and clinic for the mentally ill near the village of Saint-R&eacute;my. During his convalescence there, Van Gogh was encouraged to paint, though he rarely ventured more than a few hundred yards from the asylum&rsquo;s walls.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3c39274a1a4ab3b3466156a8244a8a3ab420133a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Saint-Paul-de-Mausole near&nbsp;Saint-R&eacute;my, France (photo: <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abtei_Saint-Paul-de-Mausole#mediaviewer/File:Chevet_de_Saint-Paul_de_Mausole.JPG\">Emdee</a> CC BY-SA 3.0)</span></span></p>\n"

(The Museum of Modern Art, New York)</span></span><br />\n"
"Besides his private room, from which he had a sweeping view of the mountain range of the Alpilles, he was also given a small studio for painting. Since this room did not look out upon the mountains but rather had a view of the asylum&rsquo;s garden, it is assumed that Van Gogh composed <em>The Starry Night</em> using elements of a few previously completed works still stored in his studio, as well as aspects from imagination and memory. It has even been argued that the church&rsquo;s spire in the village is somehow more Dutch in character and must have been painted as an amalgamation of several different&nbsp;church spires that Van Gogh had depicted years earlier while living in the Netherlands.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Van Gogh also understood the painting to be an exercise in deliberate stylization, telling his brother, &ldquo;These are exaggerations from the point of view of arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of ancient woodcuts&rdquo; (805, c. 20 September 1889). Similar to his friends Bernard and Gauguin, Van Gogh was experimenting with a style inspired in part by medieval woodcuts, with their thick outlines and simplified forms.</p>\n"

Wall reliefs are found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k with some frequency, most often representing animals, such as pairs of animals facing each other and human-like creatures.

"<p>The most remarkable art found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, however, are the installations of animal remains and among these the most striking are the bull bucrania. In many houses the main room was decorated with several plastered skulls of bulls set into the walls (most common on East or West walls) or platforms, the pointed horns thrust out into the communal space. Often the bucrania would be painted ochre red. In addition to these, the remains of other animals&rsquo; skulls, teeth, beaks, tusks or horns were set into the walls and platforms, plastered and painted. &nbsp;It would appear that the ancient residents of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were only interested in taking the pointy parts of the animals back to their homes!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How can we possibly understand this practice of interior decoration with the remains of animals? &nbsp;A clue might be in the types of creatures found and represented. Most of the animals represented in the art of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were not domesticated; wild animals dominate the art at the site. &nbsp;Interestingly, examination of bone refuse shows that the majority of the meat which was consumed was of wild animals, especially bulls. The excavator believes this selection in art and cuisine had to do with the contemporary era of increased domestication of animals and what is being celebrated are the animals which are part of the memory of the recent cultural past, when hunting was much more important for survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><span>Like at Jericho, the deceased were placed under the floors or platforms in houses and sometimes the skulls were removed and plastered to resemble live faces. &nbsp;The burials at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k show no significant variations, either based on wealth or gender; the only bodies which were treated differently, decorated with beads and covered with ochre, were those of children. The excavator of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k believes that this special concern for youths at the site may be a reflection of the society becoming more sedentary and required larger numbers of children because of increased labor, exchange and inheritance needs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

Figural paintings show the animal world alone, such as, for instance, two cranes facing each other standing behind a fox, or in interaction with people, such as a vulture pecking at a human corpse or hunting scenes. Wall reliefs are found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k with some frequency, most often representing animals, such as pairs of animals facing each other and human-like creatures.

"<p>The most remarkable art found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, however, are the installations of animal remains and among these the most striking are the bull bucrania. In many houses the main room was decorated with several plastered skulls of bulls set into the walls (most common on East or West walls) or platforms, the pointed horns thrust out into the communal space. &nbsp;Often the bucrania would be painted ochre red. In addition to these, the remains of other animas&rsquo; skulls, teeth, beaks, tusks or horns were set into the walls and platforms, plastered and painted. &nbsp;It would appear that the ancient residents of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were only interested in taking the pointy parts of the animals back to their homes!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How can we possibly understand this practice of interior decoration with the remains of animals? &nbsp;A clue might be in the types of creatures found and represented. Most of the animals represented in the art of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were not domesticated; wild animals dominate the art at the site. &nbsp;Interestingly, examination of bone refuse shows that the majority of the meat which was consumed was of wild animals, especially bulls. The excavator believes this selection in art and cuisine had to do with the contemporary era of increased domestication of animals and what is being celebrated are the animals which are part of the memory of the recent cultural past, when hunting was much more important for survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>In the Diaspora, Jewish groups lived in both Muslim- and Christian-dominated areas.

Sephardic Jews technically trace their origins back to the Iberian Peninsula, but Jews from the historically Muslim lands of the Middle East and North Africa (referred to as Mizrahi and Maghrebi, respectively), have been conflated with contemporary Sephardim since they share many of the same customs. These labels did not become widely used until the 1960s, when Jews from Islamic lands emigrated into Europe, the United States, and Israel. On a global scale, these distinctions weren&rsquo;t relevant until after World War II.</p>\n"

"<p>Although their fragile gold construction initially led some to believe that these crowns were made specifically for burial, recent research has revealed that they were also used in ceremonial rites of the Silla royalty during the Three Kingdoms Period (57 B.C.E. -&nbsp;676 C.E.). Prior to the adoption of Buddhism, Koreans practiced shamanism, which is a kind of nature worship that requires the expertise of a priest-like figure, or shaman, who intercedes to alleviate problems facing the community. Silla royalty upheld shamanistic practices in ceremonial rites such as coronations and memorial services. In these sacred rituals, the gold crowns emphasized the power of the wearer through their precious materials and natural imagery.&nbsp;</p>\n"

In this crown, three tree-shaped vertical elements evoke the sacred tree that once stood in the ritual precinct of Gyeongju. This sacred tree was conceived of as a &ldquo;world tree,&rdquo; or an axis mundi that connected heaven and earth. Two additional antler-shaped protrusions may refer to the reindeer that were native to the Eurasian steppe that lies to the north of the peninsula. Attached to the branch-like features of the crown are tiny gold discs and jade ornaments called <em>gogok</em>.

"<h3>Eurasian connections</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Silla crown demonstrates cultural interactions between the Korean peninsula and the Eurasian steppe (thousands of miles&nbsp;of grassland&nbsp;that stretches&nbsp;from central Europe through Asia). Scytho-Siberian peoples of the Eurasian steppe created golden diadems similar to the Silla crown, such as a crown from Tillya Tepe&nbsp;(an archaeological site of six nomad graves that contained objects known as the &ldquo;Bactrian Hoard&rdquo;)&nbsp;&nbsp;in modern-day Afghanistan. With five tree-shaped projections, flower ornaments and reflective discs, the Tillya Tepe crown can be compared with the natural imagery and radiant gold of the Silla crown. Though separated by many miles and by centuries, both crowns attest to shamanic beliefs prevalent among the nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppe.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Burial customs in the Three Kingdoms Period</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Though their use of gold and practice of shamanism related to the northern steppe cultures, the Silla royalty adopted the burial customs of the Chinese by burying their elite in mounded tombs. In Chinese burials, objects that were important in life were often taken to the grave. Similarly, power objects like the Silla gold crowns were used both above ground and below, and their luxurious materials conveyed the social status of the tomb occupant in the afterlife.&nbsp;</p>\n"

This gold belt, for instance, was made for the burial of a Silla king. It was like a tool belt or charm bracelet, with pendants that dangled from its band of interlinked square plates and entwining dragon openwork. Some objects were practical, such as knife sheaths and needle boxes, which evoked nomadic life on the Eurasian steppe. Others were symbolic, such as the comma-shaped ornaments seen on the Silla crown or miniature fish, which may have been charms to avert evil. The materials of the belt also corresponded to social status; for example, tombs of the Silla royalty had gold belts, while the nobility in other regions of the peninsula had silver or gilt-bronze belts.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Korea and the Silk Road</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Stretching from the Mediterranean to the Silla kingdom at the tip of the Korean peninsula, the Silk Road connected a vast terrain of ancient cultures. While the Silla kingdom shared shamanism with the Eurasian steppe and burial customs with China and Japan, the Silk Road was a main route for conveying materials, techniques, and ideas from as far away as Rome. Luxury objects in tombs of the Silla elite, such as these earrings, are made of gold and decorated with stylized foliage that resembles the Silla crown. Two tiers of leaf-shaped ornaments dangle from double loops adorned with floral motifs, continuing the imagery of the sacred world tree.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>However, a closer look at the thick, upper loop of each earring reveals the technique of granulation. Metalworking techniques, such as granulation (a&nbsp;technique whereby a surface is covered in spherules or granules of precious metal)&nbsp;and filigree&mdash;seen in the Mediterranean&mdash;appear to have traveled along the Silk Road. Silla tombs also contained other objects, such as Roman glass bowls and ewers, which reveal the extent to which luxury materials traveled via the Silk Road. These prized imports clearly inspired new forms of Korean-made luxury goods for use in both life and death.</p>\n"

"<p>Although their fragile gold construction initially led some to believe that these crowns were made specifically for burial, recent research has revealed that they were also used in ceremonial rites of the Silla royalty during the Three Kingdoms Period (57 B.C.E. -&nbsp;676 C.E.). Prior to the adoption of Buddhism, Koreans practiced shamanism, which is a kind of nature worship that requires the expertise of a priest-like figure, or shaman, who intercedes to alleviate problems facing the community. Silla royalty upheld shamanistic practices in ceremonial rites such as coronations and memorial services. In these sacred rituals, the gold crowns emphasized the power of the wearer through their precious materials and natural imagery.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Between the fifth and sixth centuries, Silla crowns became increasingly lavish with more ornamentation and additional, increasingly elongated branch-like protrusions. In this crown, three tree-shaped vertical elements evoke the sacred tree that once stood in the ritual precinct of Gyeongju. This sacred tree was conceived of as a &ldquo;world tree,&rdquo; or an axis mundi that connected heaven and earth. Two additional antler-shaped protrusions may refer to the reindeer that were native to the Eurasian steppe that lies to the north of the peninsula. Attached to the branch-like features of the crown are tiny gold discs and jade ornaments called <em>gogok</em>. These jade ornaments symbolize ripe fruits hanging from tree branches, representing fertility and abundance. With sunlight falling on its golden discs, the crown must have been a luminous sight indeed.</p>\n"

A feast to the eye, the object is filled with drawings and paintings that were meant to show scribes and illuminators how to decorate letters, paint initials, or add large segments of decoration to the page. Within this tradition, two types of model books can roughly be distinguished. Some functioned as instruction manuals. In these books, the drawings might be accompanied by a narrative or explanation that instructs the artisan how to proceed, usually in a step-by-step process. Other model books appear to have merely functioned as a source of inspiration: they present a wide array of shapes and drawings from which the artisan could take his pick.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The level of sophistication among surviving model books varies considerably. On the lower end of the spectrum there are pattern books that merely show how to make enlarged letters with some minor flourishing. On the higher end, by contrast, there are copies with high-quality stand-alone designs and sophisticated historiated initials inhabited by figures and scenes. Evidently the requirements of the artisans varied; and by proxy, so did the taste of medieval readers. It is this variation that makes model books so fascinating, both as physical objects and as cultural artifacts.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>To start at the lower end of the spectrum, some model books merely showed scribes how to execute a certain script or how to draw plain enlarged capitals&mdash;the most basic kind of decoration. The book opening seen above&nbsp;is from Gregorius Bock&rsquo;s Scribal Pattern Book, which provides instruction on both fronts (<a href=\"http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3593605\">more about the manuscript here</a>). Produced in 1510-1517, the first part of the small parchment book contains a series of alphabets in different scripts, some of which are clearly influenced by print typefaces. The second part contains decorative initials arranged in alphabetical order. In the introduction to his manual, Gregorius adds a dedication to his cousin Heinrich Lercher Wyss of Stuttgart, who was scribe to the Duke of W&uuml;rttemberg. The arrangement of the material shows how Heinrich likely used the book: he would thumb through its pages until he had reached either an alphabet or capital letter to his liking.</p>\n"

More complex&mdash;but still relatively plain&mdash;are the models provided by a much older pattern book in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. This appears to be the oldest surviving pattern book for initials: it dates from c. 1150 and was produced and used in a Tuscan workshop. The choice is much more limited than in the previous example: the Cambridge copy does not provide multiple alphabets, nor does it present a wide range of initials (in fact, only about twenty are present). Interestingly, some manuscripts survive in which we encounter decorated letters that could well be modeled from this or a similar model book (like <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=6386&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=7183\">British Library, Harley MS 7183</a>).</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Initial letter &quot;T,&quot; Gregorius Bock, Medieval Scribal Pattern Book, 1510-1517, Yale, Beinecke Library, MS 439, fols. 30v-31r \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d9472f6460725932fd24ad465bcc8f3a651ee1fc.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Initial letter T,&nbsp;Gregorius Bock, Medieval Scribal Pattern Book, 1510-1517, Yale, Beinecke Library, MS 439, fol.&nbsp;48r</span></span>This essay is devoted to a particularly attractive and rare kind of medieval manuscript: the model book. A feast to the eye, the object is filled with drawings and paintings that were meant to show scribes and illuminators how to decorate letters, paint initials, or add large segments of decoration to the page. Within this tradition, two types of model books can roughly be distinguished. Some functioned as instruction manuals. In these books, the drawings might be accompanied by a narrative or explanation that instructs the artisan how to proceed, usually in a step-by-step process. Other model books appear to have merely functioned as a source of inspiration: they present a wide array of shapes and drawings from which the artisan could take his pick.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The level of sophistication among surviving model books varies considerably. On the lower end of the spectrum there are pattern books that merely show how to make enlarged letters with some minor flourishing. On the higher end, by contrast, there are copies with high-quality stand-alone designs and sophisticated historiated initials inhabited by figures and scenes. Evidently the requirements of the artisans varied; and by proxy, so did the taste of medieval readers. It is this variation that makes model books so fascinating, both as physical objects and as cultural artifacts.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Gregorius Bock, Medieval Scribal Pattern Book, 1510-1517, Yale, Beinecke Library, MS 439, fols. 30v-31r \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/14870420613bc648360e00fe0151641f2ac6f0c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Gregorius Bock, Medieval Scribal Pattern Book, 1510-1517, Yale, Beinecke Library, MS 439, fols. 30v-31r</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To start at the lower end of the spectrum, some model books merely showed scribes how to execute a certain script or how to draw plain enlarged capitals&mdash;the most basic kind of decoration. The book opening seen above&nbsp;is from Gregorius Bock&rsquo;s Scribal Pattern Book, which provides instruction on both fronts (<a href=\"http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3593605\">more about the manuscript here</a>). Produced in 1510-1517, the first part of the small parchment book contains a series of alphabets in different scripts, some of which are clearly influenced by print typefaces. The second part contains decorative initials arranged in alphabetical order. In the introduction to his manual, Gregorius adds a dedication to his cousin Heinrich Lercher Wyss of Stuttgart, who was scribe to the Duke of W&uuml;rttemberg. The arrangement of the material shows how Heinrich likely used the book: he would thumb through its pages until he had reached either an alphabet or capital letter to his liking.</p>\n"

More complex&mdash;but still relatively plain&mdash;are the models provided by a much older pattern book in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. This appears to be the oldest surviving pattern book for initials: it dates from c. 1150 and was produced and used in a Tuscan workshop. The choice is much more limited than in the previous example: the Cambridge copy does not provide multiple alphabets, nor does it present a wide range of initials (in fact, only about twenty are present). Interestingly, some manuscripts survive in which we encounter decorated letters that could well be modeled from this or a similar model book (like <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=6386&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=7183\">British Library, Harley MS 7183</a>).</p>\n"

"<p>On the more upscale end of things is the model book known as the Macclesfield Alphabet Book. It was made and used in fifteenth-century England, apparently for the transmission of ideas to decorators or their assistants. The artisans were offered quite a lot of choice, given that we encounter no less than fourteen different alphabets on its pages. What makes this book so special, however, is their quality and the manner in which the letters are designed: their shapes are produced by human figures in various uncomfortable positions&mdash;doing yoga exercises, it seems.</p>\n"

"<p>When the British tried to expand their own trade in&nbsp;the 19th century, the Benin people killed their envoys. So in 1897 the&nbsp;British sent an armed expedition which captured the king of Benin,&nbsp;destroyed his palace and took away large quantities of sculpture and&nbsp;regalia, including works in wood, ivory and especially brass. Some of these things came from royal altars for the king&rsquo;s ancestors, but&nbsp;among them were a large number of cast brass plaques made to decorate&nbsp;the wooden pillars of the palace. These had been left in the palace&nbsp;storerooms while part of the palace was being rebuilt. As it later emerged,&nbsp;most of them were probably made between about 1550 -&nbsp;1650, the people&nbsp;and scenes that they show are so many and varied that they give a vivid&nbsp;picture of the court and kingdom of that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaques were most sought after and were bought by museums across Europe and America&mdash;you can see the plaques at the British Museum, in Chicago, Vienna, Paris and a large collection can be viewed in Berlin.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>A sacred object out of context</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The art of medieval India, like the art of medieval Europe, was primarily in the service of religion. The devotee&rsquo;s spiritual experience was enhanced by meditation inspired by works of art and architecture. Just as the luminous upper chapel of the Sainte Chapelle dazzled and overwhelmed worshipers in France, the looming bronze statues of Shiva and Parvati in, for example, the inner halls of the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, in south India would have awed a Hindu devotee.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Its important to keep in mind that the bronze <em>Shiva as Lord of the Dance</em> (&ldquo;Nataraja&rdquo;&mdash;nata meaning dance or performance, and raja meaning king or lord), is a sacred object that has been taken out of its original context&mdash;in fact, we don&#39;t even know where this particular sculpture was originally venerated. In the intimate spaces of the Florence and Herbert Irving South Asian Galleries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> is surrounded by other metal statues of Hindu gods including the Lords Vishnu, Parvati, and Hanuman. It is easy to become absorbed in the dark quiet of these galleries with its remarkable collection of divine figures, but it is important to remember that this particular statue was intended to be movable, which explains its moderate size and sizeable circular base, ideal for lifting and hoisting onto a shoulder.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Made for mobility</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the 11th century and onwards, Hindu devotees carried these statues in processional parades as priests followed chanting prayers and bestowing blessings on people gathered for this purpose. Sometimes the statues would be adorned in resplendent red and green clothes and gold jewelry to denote the glorious human form of the gods. In these processions The <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> may have had its legs wrapped with a white and red cloth, adorned with flowers, and surrounded by candles. In a religious Hindu context, the statue is the literal embodiment of the divine. When the worshiper comes before the statue and begins to pray, faith activates the divine energy inherent in the statue, and at that moment, Shiva is present.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>A bronze Shiva</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Shiva constitutes a part of a powerful triad of divine energy within the cosmos of the Hindu religion. There is Brahma, the benevolent creator of the universe; there is Vishnu, the sagacious preserver; then there is Shiva, the destroyer. &ldquo;Destroyer&rdquo; in this sense is not an entirely negative force, but one that is expansive in its impact. In Hindu religious philosophy all things must come to a natural end so they can begin anew, and Shiva is the agent that brings about this end so that a new cycle can begin.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Metropolitan Museum&#39;s <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> was made some time in the eleventh century during the Chola Dynasty (9th-13th centuries C.E.) in south India, in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu. One of the longest lasting empires of south India, the Chola Dynasty heralded a golden age of exploration, trade, and artistic development. A great area innovation within the arts of the Chola period was in the field of metalwork, particularly in bronze sculpture. The expanse of the Chola empire stretched south-east towards Sri Lanka and gave the kingdom access to vast copper reserves that enabled the proliferation of bronze work by skilled artisans.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During this period a new kind of sculpture is made, one that combines the expressive qualities of stone temple carvings with the rich iconography possible in bronze casting. This image of Shiva is taken from the ancient Indian manual of visual depiction, the <em>Shilpa Shastras</em> (The Science or Rules of Sculpture), which contained a precise set of measurements and shapes for the limbs and proportions of the divine figure. Arms were to be long like stalks of bamboo, faces round like the moon, and eyes shaped like almonds or the leaves of a lotus. The <em>Shastras </em>were a primer on the ideals of beauty and physical perfection within ancient Hindu ideology.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Beyond grace there is perfection</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The supple and expressive quality of the dancing Shiva is one of the touchstones of South Asian, and indeed, world sculpture. When the French sculptor Auguste Rodin saw some photographs of the 11th century bronze <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> in the Madras Museum around 1915, he wrote that it seemed to him the &ldquo;perfect expression of rhythmic movement in the world.&rdquo; In an essay he wrote that was published in 1921 he wrote that the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> has &ldquo;what many people cannot see&mdash;the unknown depths, the core of life. There is grace in elegance, but beyond grace there is perfection.&rdquo; The English philosopher Aldous Huxley said in an interview in 1961 that the Hindu image of god as a dancer is unlike anything he had seen in Western art. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything that approaches the symbolism of this work of art, which is both cosmic and psychological.&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The eloquent bronze statue of the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em>, despite the impact of its formal beauty on Rodin who knew little of its background, is incomplete without an understanding of its symbolism and religious significance. Bronzes of the Chola period such as <em>Shiva as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja)</em> arose out of a need to transmute the divine into a physical embodiment of beauty.</p>\n"

"<h3>Beyond grace there is perfection</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The supple and expressive quality of the dancing Shiva is one of the touchstones of South Asian, and indeed, world sculpture. When the French sculptor Auguste Rodin saw some photographs of the 11th century bronze <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> in the Madras Museum around 1915, he wrote that it seemed to him the &ldquo;perfect expression of rhythmic movement in the world.&rdquo; In an essay he wrote that was published in 1921 he wrote that the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> has &ldquo;what many people cannot see&mdash;the unknown depths, the core of life. There is grace in elegance, but beyond grace there is perfection.&rdquo; The English philosopher Aldous Huxley said in an interview in 1961 that the Hindu image of god as a dancer is unlike anything he had seen in Western art. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything that approaches the symbolism of this work of art, which is both cosmic and psychological.&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The eloquent bronze statue of the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em>, despite the impact of its formal beauty on Rodin who knew little of its background, is incomplete without an understanding of its symbolism and religious significance. Bronzes of the Chola period such as <em>Shiva as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja)</em> arose out of a need to transmute the divine into a physical embodiment of beauty.</p>\n"

"<p><u><strong>What we recommend for everyone preparing for the SAT:</strong></u></p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Diagnose your skills early on. </strong>Even if you don&rsquo;t plan on starting your studying several months before the SAT, we advise you to take a diagnostic on Khan Academy (or complete the PSAT/NMSQT) six months before the test so you&rsquo;ll have a good sense of how close you are to your SAT goal. If you have a lot of skills to learn, you might want to start studying even earlier than you&rsquo;d planned. <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"5fd84f60-77f5-49ea-ac15-71b879ef5e68\" id=\"3beb3d90-b79c-49b0-8b2a-0f81e4513071\">Fariha</gs> suggests:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Figure out what areas you need to focus on the most, and keep practicing. Don&#39;t get discouraged if at first it is difficult to understand or learn, the more you practice the easier it will get.&rdquo;</em></li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Take at least two full practice tests.</strong> We recommend taking at least one toward the beginning of your studying, and one toward the end. We also recommend you take at least one practice test on paper, which is how the actual SAT is administered, so you can get comfortable with the format. Taking a full length practice test provides a realistic sense of how long the test is and where you tend to get tired or mentally blocked. Yes, it&rsquo;s at least three hours of hard work, but if your first full SAT is on test day, you may find yourself unpleasantly surprised by how taxing all of that intense thinking can be. <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"9006690b-fcc2-4d31-ada3-28f1b16110ed\" id=\"85d97fc0-fd7b-4bd2-b744-7254c771c17f\">Gaeun</gs> says:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Full practice tests are invaluable. Taking at least two before the actual test helps you gain some sense of what it&#39;s like to sit for 4 hours taking the SAT. Timing yourself strictly and accurately is essential when taking these tests.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Familiarize yourself with the instructions for each test section</strong> (Reading, Writing and Language, Math - No Calculator, Math - Calculator, and the optional Essay). These will be the same for every new SAT, and the more comfortable you are with what you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing, the less time you&rsquo;ll spend nervously reading instructions on test day. Hannah says:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;If I take the SAT again&hellip; I would want to better know what would be expected of me on the writing portion, by looking at some kind of rubric or <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"2e4629b6-0010-4771-a3e7-abb302aa0a94\" id=\"c8127f6f-a71d-4ffd-be56-3c7db027bd25\">other</gs> guide.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Study outside of the box. </strong>Mix up your SAT prep with some general skill-building. Read and summarize long articles and scientific studies to prepare for the Reading section. Make up and solve word problems about how long it takes you to get to school or how many books fit into your backpack to take control of the Math test.

"\t<li><strong>Take a break the night before the test. </strong>We know this can be hard advice to follow - why would you waste any critical study time right before the SAT? - <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"ce866d19-869f-4935-945a-b94bb6696e23\" id=\"4ebb8913-dff0-4fc3-9833-0d289e157bef\">but</gs> it&rsquo;s important to make sure you&rsquo;re rested and relaxed when you wake up for the test. Studying at the last minute can introduce extra stress, lower your confidence, and wear you out. Instead, we recommend you do something calm and enjoyable, like watching a favorite movie or playing soccer with friends, to take your mind off the test and put yourself in a good mood. David says:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Please, do not study the SATs the night before the exam! Our neurons need some rest too.&rdquo;</em></li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Set yourself up for success on test day. </strong>What everyone says is true: a good night&rsquo;s sleep can make all the difference. Make sure you go to bed early on Friday and clock a full night of sleep. It may help to go to bed a little earlier every night the week before the test so an early bedtime on Friday feels natural. Wake up early on <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"cde38aaf-1974-4e3f-b952-e1445cea021d\" id=\"ae12da55-6583-4a25-802e-df0fe7c08a6e\">Saturday so</gs> you have plenty of time to warm up your brain before the SAT starts, and eat a full, healthy breakfast so you&rsquo;re not distracted by hunger or discomfort during the test. And don&rsquo;t forget to organize your supplies in advance! You&rsquo;ll need No. 2 pencils and a calculator <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"596f0cdf-4a27-49e7-b221-c336fe4a9b91\" id=\"478c1190-6f72-426a-a448-82dfdb33e706\">to take</gs> the test, and you will not be allowed into the test room without valid photo ID and a printed copy of your SAT test registration. The more you do to feel prepared and rested before the SAT, the more you&rsquo;ll be able to focus on success while taking the test. <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"b9c6f747-bad0-458a-a540-5a5ed934050e\" id=\"d4f04940-abbc-4725-8b67-29334cf17dfc\">Rushi</gs> says:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Try to get as much sleep as possible before the exam. You&#39;re most likely already prepared, and the extra sleep will help you think properly during the SAT.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></li>\n"

"<p><span>So how does Khan Academy&rsquo;s SAT practice fit into your study schedule? Again, there&rsquo;s no one right answer.

"<p>Born Maria Antonia Montoya, Maria Martinez became one of the best-known Native potters of the twentieth century due to her excellence as a ceramist and her connections with a larger, predominantly non-Native audience. Though she lived at the Pueblo of San Ildefonso, about 20 miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, from her birth in 1887 until her death in 1980, her work and her life had a wide reaching importance to the Native art world by reframing Native ceramics as a fine art. Before the arrival of the railroad to the area in the 1880s, pots were used in the Pueblos for food storage, cooking, and ceremonies. But with inexpensive pots appearing along the rail line, these practices were in decline. By the 1910s, Ms. Martinez found a way to continue the art by selling her pots to a non-Native audience where they were purchased as something beautiful to look at rather than as utilitarian objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Maria Martinez shown with physicist Enrico Fermi, c. 1948\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/48ceba3abba93ab52633794bc134ac477c52b529.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Maria Martinez shown with physicist Enrico Fermi, c. 1948 (public domain;&nbsp;photo by U.S. Government employee made for U.S. Government)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Her mastery as a ceramist was noted in her village while she was still young. She learned the ceramic techniques that were used in the Southwest for several millennia by watching potters from San Ildefonso, especially her aunt Nicholasa as well as potters (including Margaret Tafoya from Santa Clara), from other nearby Pueblos. All the raw materials had to be gathered and processed carefully or the final vessel would not fire properly. The clay was found locally. To make the pottery stronger it had to be mixed with a temper made from sherds of broken pots that had been pounded into a powder or volcanic ash. When mixed with water, the elasticity of the clay and the strength of the temper could be formed into different shapes, including a rounded pot (known as an <em>olla</em>) or a flat plate, using only the artist&rsquo;s hands as the potting wheel was not used. The dried vessel needed to be scraped, sanded, smoothed, then covered with a slip (a thin solution of clay and water). The slip was polished by rubbing a smooth stone over the surface to flatten the clay and create a shiny finish&mdash;a difficult and time-consuming process. Over the polished slip the pot was covered with designs painted with an iron-rich solution using either pulverized iron ore or a reduction of wild plants called guaco. These would be dried but required a high temperature firing to change the brittle clay to hard ceramics. Even without kilns, the ceramists were able to create a fire hot enough to transform the pot by using manure.</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Making ceramics in the Pueblo was considered a communal activity, where different steps in the process were often shared. The potters helped each other with the arduous tasks such as mixing the paints and polishing the slip. Ms. Martinez would form the perfectly symmetrical vessels by hand and leave the decorating to others. Throughout her career, she worked with different family members, including her husband Julian, her son Adam and his wife Santana, and her son Popovi Da. As the pots moved into a fine art market, Ms. Martinez was encouraged to sign her name on the bottom of her pots. Though this denied the communal nature of the art, she began to do so as it resulted in more money per pot. To help other potters in the Pueblo, Ms. Martinez was known to have signed the pots of others, lending her name to help the community. Helping her Pueblo was of paramount importance to Ms. Martinez. She lived as a proper Pueblo woman, avoiding self-aggrandizement and insisting to scholars that she was just a wife and mother even as her reputation in the outside world increased.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Maria and Julian Martinez pioneered a style of applying a matte-black design over polished-black. Similar to the pot pictured here, the design was based on pottery sherds found on an Ancestral Pueblo dig site dating to the twelfth to seventeenth centuries at what is now known as Bandelier National Monument. The Martinezes worked at the site, with Julian helping the archaeologists at the dig and Maria helping at the campsite. Julian Martinez spent time drawing and painting the designs found on the walls and on the sherds of pottery into his notebooks, designs he later recreated on pots. In the 1910s, Maria and Julian worked together to recreate the black-on-black ware they found at the dig, experimenting with clay from different areas and using different firing techniques. Taking a cue from Santa Clara pots, they discovered that smothering the fire with powdered manure removed the oxygen while retaining the heat and resulted in a pot that was blackened. This resulted in a pot that was less hard and not entirely watertight, which worked for the new market that prized decorative use over utilitarian value. The areas that were burnished had a shiny black surface and the areas painted with guaco were matte designs based on natural phenomenon, such as rain clouds, bird feathers, rows of planted corn, and the flow of rivers.</p>\n"

"<p>The olla pictured above&nbsp;features two design bands, one across the widest part of the pot and the other around the neck. The elements inside are abstract but suggest a bird in flight with rain clouds above, perhaps a prayer for rain that could be flown up to the sky. These designs are exaggerated due to the low rounded shapes of the pot, which are bulbous around the shoulder then narrow at the top. The shape, color, and designs fit the contemporary Art Deco movement, which was popular between the two World Wars and emphasized bold, geometric forms and colors. With its dramatic shape and the high polish of surface, this pot exemplifies Maria Martinez&rsquo;s skill in transforming a utilitarian object into a fine art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work of Maria Martinez marks an important point in the long history of Pueblo pottery. Ceramics from the Southwest trace a connection from the Ancestral Pueblo to the modern Pueblo eras. Given the absence of written records, tracing the changes in the shapes, materials, and designs on the long-lasting sherds found across the area allow scholars to see connections and innovations. Maria Martinez brought the distinctive Pueblo style into a wider context, allowing Native and non-Native audiences to appreciate the art form.</p>\n"

Though she lived at the Pueblo of San Ildefonso, about 20 miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, from her birth in 1887 until her death in 1980, her work and her life had a wide reaching importance to the Native art world by reframing Native ceramics as a fine art. Before the arrival of the railroad to the area in the 1880s, pots were used in the Pueblos for food storage, cooking, and ceremonies. But with inexpensive pots appearing along the rail line, these practices were in decline. By the 1910s, Ms. Martinez found a way to continue the art by selling her pots to a non-Native audience where they were purchased as something beautiful to look at rather than as utilitarian objects.</p>\n"

"<p><span>Her mastery as a ceramist was noted in her village while she was still young. She learned the ceramic techniques that were used in the Southwest for several millennia by watching potters from San Ildefonso, especially her aunt Nicholasa as well as potters (including Margaret Tafoya from Santa Clara), from other nearby Pueblos. All the raw materials had to be gathered and processed carefully or the final vessel would not fire properly. The clay was found locally. To make the pottery stronger it had to be mixed with a temper made from sherds of broken pots that had been pounded into a powder or volcanic ash. When mixed with water, the elasticity of the clay and the strength of the temper could be formed into different shapes, including a rounded pot (known as an <em>olla</em>) or a flat plate, using only the artist&rsquo;s hands as the potting wheel was not used. The dried vessel needed to be scraped, sanded, smoothed, then covered with a slip (a thin solution of clay and water). The slip was polished by rubbing a smooth stone over the surface to flatten the clay and create a shiny finish&mdash;a difficult and time-consuming process. Over the polished slip the pot was covered with designs painted with an iron-rich solution using either pulverized iron ore or a reduction of wild plants called guaco. These would be dried but required a high temperature firing to change the brittle clay to hard ceramics. Even without kilns, the ceramists were able to create a fire hot enough to transform the pot by using manure.</span></p>\n"

"<p>Making ceramics in the Pueblo was considered a communal activity, where different steps in the process were often shared. The potters helped each other with the arduous tasks such as mixing the paints and polishing the slip. Ms. Martinez would form the perfectly symmetrical vessels by hand and leave the decorating to others. Throughout her career, she worked with different family members, including her husband Julian, her son Adam and his wife Santana, and her son Popovi Da. As the pots moved into a fine art market, Ms. Martinez was encouraged to sign her name on the bottom of her pots. Though this denied the communal nature of the art, she began to do so as it resulted in more money per pot. To help other potters in the Pueblo, Ms. Martinez was known to have signed the pots of others, lending her name to help the community. Helping her Pueblo was of paramount importance to Ms. Martinez. She lived as a proper Pueblo woman, avoiding self-aggrandizement and insisting to scholars that she was just a wife and mother even as her reputation in the outside world increased.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Maria and Julian Martinez pioneered a style of applying a matte-black design over polished-black. Similar to the pot pictured here, the design was based on pottery sherds found on an Ancestral Pueblo dig site dating to the twelfth to seventeenth centuries at what is now known as Bandelier National Monument. The Martinezes worked at the site, with Julian helping the archaeologists at the dig and Maria helping at the campsite. Julian Martinez spent time drawing and painting the designs found on the walls and on the sherds of pottery into his notebooks, designs he later recreated on pots. In the 1910s, Maria and Julian worked together to recreate the black-on-black ware they found at the dig, experimenting with clay from different areas and using different firing techniques. Taking a cue from Santa Clara pots, they discovered that smothering the fire with powdered manure removed the oxygen while retaining the heat and resulted in a pot that was blackened. This resulted in a pot that was less hard and not entirely watertight, which worked for the new market that prized decorative use over utilitarian value. The areas that were burnished had a shiny black surface and the areas painted with guaco were matte designs based on natural phenomenon, such as rain clouds, bird feathers, rows of planted corn, and the flow of rivers.</p>\n"

"<p>The olla pictured above&nbsp;features two design bands, one across the widest part of the pot and the other around the neck. The elements inside are abstract but suggest a bird in flight with rain clouds above, perhaps a prayer for rain that could be flown up to the sky. These designs are exaggerated due to the low rounded shapes of the pot, which are bulbous around the shoulder then narrow at the top. The shape, color, and designs fit the contemporary Art Deco movement, which was popular between the two World Wars and emphasized bold, geometric forms and colors. With its dramatic shape and the high polish of surface, this pot exemplifies Maria Martinez&rsquo;s skill in transforming a utilitarian object into a fine art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work of Maria Martinez marks an important point in the long history of Pueblo pottery. Ceramics from the Southwest trace a connection from the Ancestral Pueblo to the modern Pueblo eras. Given the absence of written records, tracing the changes in the shapes, materials, and designs on the long-lasting sherds found across the area allow scholars to see connections and innovations. Maria Martinez brought the distinctive Pueblo style into a wider context, allowing Native and non-Native audiences to appreciate the art form.</p>\n"

"<p>For most of us, architecture is easy to take for granted. Its everywhere in our daily lives&mdash;sometimes elegant, other times shabby, but generally ubiquitous. How often do we stop to examine and contemplate its form and style? Stopping for that contemplation offers not only the opportunity to understand one&rsquo;s daily surroundings, but also to appreciate the connection that exists between architectural forms in our own time and those from the past. Architectural tradition and design has the ability to link disparate cultures together over time and space&mdash;and this is certainly true of the legacy of architectural forms created by the ancient Greeks.</p>\n"

"<h3>Temple</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most recognizably &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; structure is the temple (even though the architecture of Greek temples is actually quite&nbsp;diverse). The Greeks referred to temples with the term ὁ &nu;&alpha;ό&sigmaf; (<em>ho na&oacute;s</em>) meaning &quot;dwelling;&quot;&nbsp;temple derives from the Latin term, <em>templum</em>. The earliest shrines were built to honor divinities and were made from&nbsp;materials such as a wood and mud brick&mdash;materials&nbsp;that typically don&#39;t survive very long. The basic form of the<em> naos</em> emerges as early as the tenth century B.C.E. as a simple, rectangular room with projecting walls (<em>antae</em>) that created a shallow porch. This basic form remained unchanged in its concept for centuries. In the eighth century B.C.E.&nbsp;Greek architecture begins&nbsp;to make the move from ephemeral materials (wood, mud brick, thatch) to permanent materials (namely, stone).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Archaic period the tenets of the Doric order of architecture in the Greek mainland became firmly established, leading to a wave of monumental temple building during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. Greek city-states invested substantial resources in temple building&mdash;as they competed with each other not just in strategic and economic terms, but also in their architecture. For example, Athens devoted enormous resources to the construction of the&nbsp;acropolis in the 5th century B.C.E.&mdash;in part so that Athenians could be confident&nbsp;that the temples built to honor their gods surpassed anything that their rival states could offer.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The multi-phase architectural development of sanctuaries such as that of Hera on the island of Samos demonstrate not only the change that occurred in construction techniques over time but also&nbsp;how the Greeks&nbsp;re-used&nbsp;sacred spaces&mdash;with the later phases built directly atop the preceding ones. Perhaps the fullest, and most famous, expression of Classical Greek temple architecture is the Periclean Parthenon of Athens&mdash;a Doric order structure, the Parthenon represents the maturity of the Greek classical form.</p>\n"

"Greek temples are often categorized in terms of their ground plan and the way in which the columns are arranged. A prostyle temple is a temple that has columns only at the front, while an amphiprostyle temple has columns at the front and the rear. Temples with a peripteral arrangement (from the Greek &pi;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu; (<em>pteron</em>) meaning &quot;wing) have a single line of columns arranged all around the exterior of the temple building. Dipteral temples simply have a double row of columns surrounding the building. One of the more unusual plans is the tholos, a temple with a circular ground plan; famous examples are attested at the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi and the sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidauros.</p>\n"

"<h3>Stoa</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Stoa (&sigma;&tau;&omicron;ά) is a Greek architectural term that describes a covered walkway or colonnade that was usually designed for public use. Early examples, often employing the Doric order, were usually composed of a single level, although later examples (Hellenistic and Roman) came to be two-story freestanding structures. These later examples allowed interior space for shops or other rooms and often incorporated the Ionic order for interior colonnades.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Greek city planners came to prefer the stoa as a device for framing the agora (public market place) of a city or town. The South Stoa constructed as part of the sanctuary of Hera on the island of Samos (c. 700-550 B.C.E.) numbers among the earliest examples of the stoa in Greek architecture. Many cities, particularly Athens and Corinth, came to have elaborate and famous stoas. In Athens the famous Stoa Poikile (&ldquo;Painted Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., housed paintings of famous Greek military exploits including the battle of Marathon, while the Stoa Basileios (&ldquo;Royal Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., was the seat of a chief civic official (<em>archon basileios</em>).</p>\n"

At Corinth the stoa persisted as an architectural type well into the Roman period; the South Stoa there (above), c. 150 C.E., shows the continued utility of this building design for framing civic space. From the Hellenistic period onwards the stoa also lent its name to a philosophical school, as Zeno of Citium (c. 334-262 B.C.E.) originally taught his Stoic philosophy in the Stoa Poikile of Athens.</p>\n"

Theaters often took advantage of hillsides and naturally sloping terrain and, in general, utilized the panoramic landscape as the backdrop to the stage itself. The Greek theater is composed of the seating area (theatron), a circular space for the chorus to perform (orchestra), and the stage (<em>skene</em>). Tiered seats in the theatron provided space for spectators. Two side aisles (<em>parados</em>, pl. <em>paradoi</em>) provided access to the orchestra. The Greek theater inspired the Roman version of the theater directly, although the Romans introduced some modifications to the concept of theater architecture. In many cases the Romans converted pre-existing Greek theaters to conform to their own architectural ideals, as is evident in the Theater of Dionysos on the slopes of the Athenian Acropolis. Since theatrical performances were often linked to sacred festivals, it is not uncommon to find theaters associated directly with sanctuaries.</p>\n"

"<p>The Bouleuterion (&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&tau;ή&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;) was an important civic building in a Greek city, as it was the meeting place of the boule (citizen council) of the city.

The bouleuterion generally was a covered, rectilinear building with stepped seating surrounding a central speaker&rsquo;s well in which an altar was placed. The city of Pri&egrave;ne has a particularly well-preserved example of this civic structure as does the city of Miletus.</p>\n"

"<h3>House</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Greek houses of the Archaic and Classical periods were relatively simple in design. Houses usually were centered on a courtyard that would have been the scene for various ritual activities; the courtyard also provided natural light for the often small houses. The ground floor rooms would have included kitchen and storage rooms, perhaps an animal pen and a latrine; the chief room was the <em>andron&mdash;</em>site of the male-dominated drinking party (<em>symposion</em>). The quarters for women and children (<em>gynaikeion</em>) could be located on the second level (if present) and were, in any case, segregated from the mens&rsquo; area. It was not <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Plan, Olynthus (Greece), House A vii 4, built after 432 but before 348 B.C.E., from Olynthus, vol. 8 pl. 99, 100 and fig. 5 (photo: Perseus Digital Library)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/75c06bf3b223ae048bf1e30d69df4eb3e72a15c7.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plan, Olynthus (Greece), House A vii 4, built after 432,&nbsp;before 348 B.C.E., from <em>Olynthus</em>, vol. 8 pl. 99, 100 and fig. 5, kitchen complex&nbsp;c, d, and e; &nbsp;andron (k)&nbsp;(photo: Perseus Digital Library)</span></span>uncommon for houses to be attached to workshops or shops. The houses excavated in the southwest part of the Athenian Agora had walls of mud brick that rested on stone socles and tiled roofs, with floors of beaten clay.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The city of Olynthus in Chalcidice, Greece, destroyed by military action in 348 B.C.E., preserves many well-appointed courtyard houses arranged within the Hippodamian grid-plan of the city. House A vii 4&nbsp;had a large cobbled courtyard that was used for domestic industry. While some rooms were fairly plain, with earthen floors, the <em>andron</em> was the most well-appointed room of the house.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Fortifications</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Fortifications, Palairos (Greece)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ac9fa24828faa454e8f7884c04794c7be2bab7fa.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Fortifications and gate, Palairos (Greece)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Mycenaean fortifications of Bronze Age Greece (c. 1300&nbsp;B.C.E.)&nbsp;are particularly well known&mdash;the megalithic architecture (also referred to as Cyclopean because of the use of enormous stones) represents a trend in Bronze Age architecture.&nbsp;While these massive Bronze Age walls are difficult to best, first millennium B.C.E. Greece also shows evidence for stone built fortification walls. In Attika (the territory of Athens), a series of Classical and Hellenistic walls built in ashlar masonry (squared masonry blocks) have been studied as a potential system of border defenses. &nbsp;At Palairos in Epirus (Greece) the massive fortifications enclose a high citadel that occupies imposing terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Stadium, Gymnasium, and Palaestra</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Greek stadium (derived from <em>stadion</em>, a Greek measurement equivalent to c. 578 feet or 176 meters) was the location of foot races held as part of sacred games; these structures are often found in the context of sanctuaries, as in the case of &nbsp;the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Olympia and Epidauros. Long and narrow, with a horseshoe shape, the stadium occupied reasonably flat terrain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The gymnasium (from the Greek term <em>gymn&oacute;s</em> meaning &quot;naked&quot;) was a training center for athletes who participated in public games. This facility tended to include areas for both training and storage. The<em> </em>palaestra (&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;ί&sigma;&tau;&rho;&alpha;) was an exercise facility originally connected with the training of wrestlers. These complexes were generally rectilinear in plan, with a colonnade framing a central, open space.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Altar</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Altar of Hieron II \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3439d4bb1d27b21571fabf5110421aa649fc1ec5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Altar of Hieron II, 3rd century B.C.E.&nbsp;(Syracuse, Sicily, Italy)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Since blood sacrifice was a key component of Greek ritual practice, an altar was essential for these purposes. While altars did not necessarily need to be architecturalized, they could be and, in some cases, they assumed a monumental scale. The third century B.C.E. Altar of Hieron II at Syracuse, Sicily, provides one such example. At c. 196 meters in length and c. 11 m in height the massive altar was reported to be capable of hosting the simultaneous sacrifice of 450 bulls (Diodorus Siculus <em>History</em> 11.72.2).</p>\n"

The altar itself is screened by a monumental enclosure decorated with sculpture; the monument measures c. 35.64 by 33.4 meters. The altar is best known for its program of relief sculpture that depict a gigantomachy (battle between the Olympian gods and the giants) that is presented as an allegory for the military conquests of the kings of Pergamon. Despite its monumental scale and lavish decoration, the Pergamon altar preserves the basic and necessary features of the Greek altar: it is frontal and approached by stairs and is open to the air&mdash;to allow not only for the blood sacrifice itself but also for the burning of the thigh bones and fat as an offering to the gods.</p>\n"

The Southeast Fountain house in the Athenian Agora (c. 530 B.C.E.) provides an example of this tendency to position fountain houses and their dependable supply of clean drinking water close to civic spaces like the agora. Gathering water was seen as a woman&rsquo;s task and, as such, it offered the often isolated women a chance to socialize with others while collecting water. Fountain house scenes are common on ceramic water jars (<em>hydriai</em>), as is the case for a Black-figured hydria (c. 525-500 B.C.E.) found in an Etruscan tomb in Vulci that is now in the British Museum&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Legacy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The architecture of ancient Greece influenced ancient&nbsp;Roman architecture, and became the architectural vernacular employed in the expansive Hellenistic world created in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Greek architectural forms became implanted so deeply in the Roman architectural mindset that they endured throughout antiquity, only to then be re-discovered in the Renaissance and especially from the mid-eighteenth century onwards as a feature of the Neo-Classical movement. This durable legacy helps to explain why the ancient Greek architectural orders and the tenets of Greek design are still so prevalent&mdash;and visible&mdash;in our post-modern world.</p>\n"

"<p>For most of us, architecture is easy to take for granted. Its everywhere in our daily lives&mdash;sometimes elegant, other times shabby, but generally ubiquitous. How often do we stop to examine and contemplate its form and style? Stopping for that contemplation offers not only the opportunity to understand one&rsquo;s daily surroundings, but also to appreciate the connection that exists between architectural forms in our own time and those from the past. Architectural tradition and design has the ability to link disparate cultures together over time and space&mdash;and this is certainly true of the legacy of architectural forms created by the ancient Greeks.</p>\n"

"<h3>Temple</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most recognizably &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; structure is the temple (even though the architecture of Greek temples is actually quite&nbsp;diverse). The Greeks referred to temples with the term ὁ &nu;&alpha;ό&sigmaf; (<em>ho na&oacute;s</em>) meaning &quot;dwelling;&quot;&nbsp;temple derives from the Latin term, <em>templum</em>. The earliest shrines were built to honor divinities and were made from&nbsp;materials such as a wood and mud brick&mdash;materials&nbsp;that typically don&#39;t survive very long. The basic form of the<em> naos</em> emerges as early as the tenth century B.C.E. as a simple, rectangular room with projecting walls (<em>antae</em>) that created a shallow porch. This basic form remained unchanged in its concept for centuries. In the eighth century B.C.E.&nbsp;Greek architecture begins&nbsp;to make the move from ephemeral materials (wood, mud brick, thatch) to permanent materials (namely, stone).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Archaic period the tenets of the Doric order of architecture in the Greek mainland became firmly established, leading to a wave of monumental temple building during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. Greek city-states invested substantial resources in temple building&mdash;as they competed with each other not just in strategic and economic terms, but also in their architecture. For example, Athens devoted enormous resources to the construction of the&nbsp;acropolis in the 5th century B.C.E.&mdash;in part so that Athenians could be confident&nbsp;that the temples built to honor their gods surpassed anything that their rival states could offer.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The multi-phase architectural development of sanctuaries such as that of Hera on the island of Samos demonstrate not only the change that occurred in construction techniques over time but also&nbsp;how the Greeks&nbsp;re-used&nbsp;sacred spaces&mdash;with the later phases built directly atop the preceding ones. Perhaps the fullest, and most famous, expression of Classical Greek temple architecture is the Periclean Parthenon of Athens&mdash;a Doric order structure, the Parthenon represents the maturity of the Greek classical form.</p>\n"

"Greek temples are often categorized in terms of their ground plan and the way in which the columns are arranged. A prostyle temple is a temple that has columns only at the front, while an amphiprostyle temple has columns at the front and the rear. Temples with a peripteral arrangement (from the Greek &pi;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu; (<em>pteron</em>) meaning &quot;wing) have a single line of columns arranged all around the exterior of the temple building. Dipteral temples simply have a double row of columns surrounding the building. One of the more unusual plans is the tholos, a temple with a circular ground plan; famous examples are attested at the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi and the sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidauros.</p>\n"

"<p>Stoa (&sigma;&tau;&omicron;ά) is a Greek architectural term that describes a covered walkway or colonnade that was usually designed for public use. Early examples, often employing the Doric order, were usually composed of a single level, although later examples (Hellenistic and Roman) came to be two-story freestanding structures. These later examples allowed interior space for shops or other rooms and often incorporated the Ionic order for interior colonnades.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Greek city planners came to prefer the stoa as a device for framing the agora (public market place) of a city or town. The South Stoa constructed as part of the sanctuary of Hera on the island of Samos (c. 700-550 B.C.E.) numbers among the earliest examples of the stoa in Greek architecture. Many cities, particularly Athens and Corinth, came to have elaborate and famous stoas. In Athens the famous Stoa Poikile (&ldquo;Painted Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., housed paintings of famous Greek military exploits including the battle of Marathon, while the Stoa Basileios (&ldquo;Royal Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., was the seat of a chief civic official (<em>archon basileios</em>).</p>\n"

At Corinth the stoa persisted as an architectural type well into the Roman period; the South Stoa there (above), c. 150 C.E., shows the continued utility of this building design for framing civic space. From the Hellenistic period onwards the stoa also lent its name to a philosophical school, as Zeno of Citium (c. 334-262 B.C.E.) originally taught his Stoic philosophy in the Stoa Poikile of Athens.</p>\n"

Theaters often took advantage of hillsides and naturally sloping terrain and, in general, utilized the panoramic landscape as the backdrop to the stage itself. The Greek theater is composed of the seating area (theatron), a circular space for the chorus to perform (orchestra), and the stage (<em>skene</em>). Tiered seats in the theatron provided space for spectators. Two side aisles (<em>parados</em>, pl. <em>paradoi</em>) provided access to the orchestra. The Greek theater inspired the Roman version of the theater directly, although the Romans introduced some modifications to the concept of theater architecture. In many cases the Romans converted pre-existing Greek theaters to conform to their own architectural ideals, as is evident in the Theater of Dionysos on the slopes of the Athenian Acropolis. Since theatrical performances were often linked to sacred festivals, it is not uncommon to find theaters associated directly with sanctuaries.</p>\n"

"<p>The Greek stadium (derived from <em>stadion</em>, a Greek measurement equivalent to c. 578 feet or 176 meters) was the location of foot races held as part of sacred games; these structures are often found in the context of sanctuaries, as in the case of &nbsp;the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Olympia and Epidauros. Long and narrow, with a horseshoe shape, the stadium occupied reasonably flat terrain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The gymnasium (from the Greek term <em>gymn&oacute;s</em> meaning &quot;naked&quot;) was a training center for athletes who participated in public games. This facility tended to include areas for both training and storage. The<em> </em>palaestra (&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;ί&sigma;&tau;&rho;&alpha;) was an exercise facility originally connected with the training of wrestlers. These complexes were generally rectilinear in plan, with a colonnade framing a central, open space.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Altar of Hieron II \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3439d4bb1d27b21571fabf5110421aa649fc1ec5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Altar of Hieron II, 3rd century B.C.E.&nbsp;(Syracuse, Sicily, Italy)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Since blood sacrifice was a key component of Greek ritual practice, an altar was essential for these purposes. While altars did not necessarily need to be architecturalized, they could be and, in some cases, they assumed a monumental scale. The third century B.C.E. Altar of Hieron II at Syracuse, Sicily, provides one such example. At c. 196 meters in length and c. 11 m in height the massive altar was reported to be capable of hosting the simultaneous sacrifice of 450 bulls (Diodorus Siculus <em>History</em> 11.72.2).</p>\n"

The altar itself is screened by a monumental enclosure decorated with sculpture; the monument measures c. 35.64 by 33.4 meters. The altar is best known for its program of relief sculpture that depict a gigantomachy (battle between the Olympian gods and the giants) that is presented as an allegory for the military conquests of the kings of Pergamon. Despite its monumental scale and lavish decoration, the Pergamon altar preserves the basic and necessary features of the Greek altar: it is frontal and approached by stairs and is open to the air&mdash;to allow not only for the blood sacrifice itself but also for the burning of the thigh bones and fat as an offering to the gods.</p>\n"

The Southeast Fountain house in the Athenian Agora (c. 530 B.C.E.) provides an example of this tendency to position fountain houses and their dependable supply of clean drinking water close to civic spaces like the agora. Gathering water was seen as a woman&rsquo;s task and, as such, it offered the often isolated women a chance to socialize with others while collecting water. Fountain house scenes are common on ceramic water jars (<em>hydriai</em>), as is the case for a Black-figured hydria (c. 525-500 B.C.E.) found in an Etruscan tomb in Vulci that is now in the British Museum&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Legacy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The architecture of ancient Greece influenced ancient&nbsp;Roman architecture, and became the architectural vernacular employed in the expansive Hellenistic world created in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Greek architectural forms became implanted so deeply in the Roman architectural mindset that they endured throughout antiquity, only to then be re-discovered in the Renaissance and especially from the mid-eighteenth century onwards as a feature of the Neo-Classical movement. This durable legacy helps to explain why the ancient Greek architectural orders and the tenets of Greek design are still so prevalent&mdash;and visible&mdash;in our post-modern world.</p>\n"

"<p>How is it that the Jews, called by Scripture &ldquo;the smallest of all the nations&rdquo; (Deut. 7:7) merit a section on religious architecture placed alongside the glories of Christendom, Islam, and Buddhism? After all, the Jews today number something around fourteen million, the same number that existed before the massacre of six million in Europe and the dissolution of communities across Europe and the Arab world during the 1940s. This is a numerical highpoint. In previous centuries, the numbers were far smaller. Just on the basis of demography, then, it would be hard to justify the inclusion of Judaism in this history of art and architecture.</p>\n"

"<h3>A national style?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More difficult, perhaps, from the first century through the establishment of modern Israel in 1948 Jews could not claim (or assert, as new European nations states did) a &ldquo;national&rdquo; identity or a &ldquo;national&rdquo; style of art based upon landed nationalism&mdash;categories that were of central importance to nineteenth and twentieth century constructions of architectural history and style.

Small Jewish communities, stretched across the world from late antique Palestine to Kaifeng in 17th century China to contemporary America and Israel built synagogues&mdash;often buildings of great beauty and historical significance, but mostly pretty limited from an architectural standpoint. There were no Jewish benefactors to compete with Justinian or Saladin or the della Rovere; and virtually no government sponsorship of magnificent synagogues.

"<h3>Longevity</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What Jews lacked in territory, wealth and numbers, they made up for in longevity. Jews&mdash;short for &ldquo;the Judeans,&rdquo; trace their cultural heritage, and sometimes their physical lineage, to the biblical patriarchs&mdash;Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (also called Israel) and to the land of Israel (called in Roman times Judaea)&mdash;an unbroken chain of 3000 years. This is not just an &ldquo;imagined&rdquo; history. No other western community can assert&mdash;based upon rich documentary and physical evidence&mdash;to have encountered both Cyrus the Great and Innocent III, Caligula and Mohammed, Victoria, Stalin and Rembrandt. Though a minority, Jews maintained rich mimetic traditions across the empires that make up the &ldquo;Western world,&rdquo; and an astonishingly complex book culture that has sustained their sense of group cohesion. From antiquity to modern times, it was (and in many ways, still is) possible to travel from Jewish community to Jewish community from Persia to Spain and beyond&mdash;as travelers did&mdash;and find Jews who shared an all encompassing religious culture&mdash;even if they ate &ldquo;strange&rdquo; (though always&nbsp;kosher) foods, dressed &ldquo;funny&rdquo; (though males still wore the biblically mandated ritual &ldquo;fringes&rdquo;) and practiced &ldquo;strange&rdquo; local liturgical customs. Not speaking the same vernacular language, a visitor from, say, Germany might have communicated with his hosts in, say, Egypt, by drawing upon mix of &ldquo;peculiarly pronounced&rdquo; Hebrew and Aramaic gained through exposure to vast quantities of canonical religious texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Jews and their texts&mdash;not always together&mdash;have been active in what some textbooks still call &ldquo;the Western Experience&rdquo; from its beginning. The religious traditions associated with Jesus and Mohammed both assert that Jewish scripture, and interaction with Jews, is essential their own revelations, both of which assert relationship by virtue of having &quot;superseded&rdquo; the revelation of Moses. In other words, Jews &ldquo;matter&rdquo; to Christians and to Muslims, and by virtue of living among them, Christians and Muslims &ldquo;mattered&rdquo; to Jews.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The study of Jewish art and architecture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The academic study of Jewish architecture developed from the eighteenth century onward, when Christian Hebraists and bible scholars developed interests in biblical architecture&mdash;the Mosaic Tabernacle, the Solomonic Temple and the Herodian Temple&mdash;the latter visited by Jesus, who according to the Gospels predicted its destruction in 70 C.E. under emperor Vespasian. Post-&ldquo;biblical&rdquo; Jewish architecture did not become a focus of research until discoveries by the Palestine Exploration Fund of late antique synagogues during the 1860s. Medieval and early modern buildings took a bit longer to occasion scholarly interest. Jews in 19th century Europe, America and to some degree Islamic lands and south Asia, were engaged in a full-scale building boom; the largest since Herod the Great&rsquo;s rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple beginning 20/19 B.C.E. Newly emancipated and emancipating communities asserted their presence by building huge synagogues, experimenting with a wide range of forms, from neo-Egyptian to neo-classical and neo-moresque, eventually settling upon the modern yet traditionalist tones of art deco.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Only at the end of the 19th century did scholars begin to look back and study &ldquo;Jewish art,&rdquo; including Jewish architecture; often looking&mdash;whether intentionally or not&mdash;for roots for the contemporary boom in earlier periods. Hoping to prove that &ldquo;Jews do art too,&rdquo; Jews of all stripes hoped to prove their humanity through the creation and study of Jewish art. It was only in post-war New York that the first&mdash;and perhaps still the best&mdash;comprehensive surveys of Jewish religious architecture were written, both by art historian/architect Rachel Wischnitzer. These were entitled <em>European Synagogue Architecture</em> and <em>Synagogue Architecture in America</em>.&nbsp;By then, the State of Israel had been established, and &ldquo;Jewish art&rdquo;&mdash;including architecture&mdash;became the national art.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The canonical book of this process was Cecil Roth&rsquo;s <em>Jewish Art: An Illustrated History</em>, first published in Hebrew in 1958 and still in print in Hebrew. This anthology brought together scholars who had been scattered throughout the world due to the War to present a comprehensive history, from Solomon to the present. Architecture&mdash;until the modern period, all of it &ldquo;religious&rdquo; appears in every period and in almost every article, with some articles dedicated to this subject. The study of Jewish architecture has been of particular interest to Israeli scholars, but also to Americans and Europeans, and the Hebrew University&rsquo;s Center for Jewish Art has sent teams across the world to document historical synagogues&mdash;most no longer used. In Europe, this work takes on additional significance, as it has been spawned by a real interest to regain a now-lost heritage&mdash;particularly in the East, as Europe, particularly since the fall of Communism, has sought to develop a more tolerant European tradition and usable history.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In recent years, Jewish visual culture has been deeply assimilated into the academic study of Judaism, really for the first time. Cultural historians, working with art historians and architectural historians, have begun to focus upon the very elements of Jewish &ldquo;minority&rdquo; architecture that in previous generations were often spurned. The process by which a small minority group melded with its general environment, transforming and being transformed within that environment has become the stuff of contemporary scholarship. In many ways, the Jews have been the &ldquo;canary in the coal mine,&rdquo; the test case for theoretical discussion of what it means to live in diaspora and to be Europe&#39;s first, earliest and most intimate&mdash;colonized people.</p>\n"

"<p>Imperial Chinese history is marked by the rise and fall of many dynasties and occasional periods of disunity, but overall the age was remarkably stable and marked by a sophisticated governing system that included the concept of a meritocracy. Each dynasty had its own distinct characteristics and in many eras encounters with foreign cultural and political influences through territorial expansion and waves of immigration also brought new stimulus to China. China was a highly literate society that greatly valued poetry and brush-written calligraphy, which along with painting, were called the Three Perfections, reflecting the esteemed position of the arts in Chinese life.&nbsp;Imperial China produced many technological advancements that have enriched the world, including paper and porcelain.</p>\n"

"<p>It is hard to summarize the impact of a movement that spanned centuries and continents, crossed social lines, and affected all levels of culture. However, there are a few central effects that can be highlighted.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Military orders</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>First, the earliest military orders originated in Jerusalem in the wake of the First Crusade. A miltary order is a&nbsp;religious order in which members take traditional monastic vows&mdash;communal poverty, chastity, and obedience&mdash;but also commit to violence on behalf of the Christian faith. Well-known examples include the Knights Templar (officially endorsed in 1129), the Knights Hospitaller (confirmed by papal bull in 1113), and the Teutonic Knights (originated in the late twelfth century).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The military orders represented a major theological and military development, and went on to play central roles in the formation of key political units that still exist today&nbsp;as nation-states.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Wall plaque, Ascalon, mid-twelfth to mid-thirteenth century (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem).

"\n"
"<h3>Territorial expansion</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Second, crusading played a major role in European territorial expansion. The First Crusade resulted in the formation of the crusader states in the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean), which were initially governed, and in small&nbsp;part populated, by settlers from Europe.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Crusading in northern and eastern Europe led to the expansion of kingdoms like Denmark and Sweden, as well as the creation of brand-new political units, for example in Prussia. As areas around the Baltic Sea were taken by the crusaders, traders and settlers&mdash;mostly German&mdash;moved in and profited economically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Mediterranean Sea, crusading led to the conquest and colonization of many islands, which arguably helped ensure Christian control of Mediterranean trade routes (at least for as long as the islands were held). Crusading also played a role in the conquest of the Iberian peninsula (now Spain and Portugal). This was finally completed in 1492, when the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand II and Isabella I conquered the last Muslim community on the peninsula&mdash;the city of Granada. They expelled Jews from the country in the same year. And of course, they also authorized and supported the expeditions of Christopher Columbus, who&mdash;like many European explorers of his day&mdash;believed that the expansion of the Christian faith was one of his duties.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Impact in Europe (religious and secular)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Third, the crusading movement impacted internal European development in a few important ways. The movement helped both to militarize the medieval western Church and to sustain criticism of that militarization. It arguably helped solidify&nbsp;the pope&rsquo;s control over the Church and made certain financial innovations central to Church operations. And it both reflected and influenced devotional trends. For example, while there was some dedication to St. George from the early Middle Ages, the intensity of that devotion soared in Europe after he reportedly intervened miraculously at the Battle of Antioch in 1098, during the First Crusade.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Secular political theories were influenced by crusading, especially in France and the Iberian peninsula, and government institutions evolved in part to meet the logistical needs of crusading. Credit infrastructures within Europe rose to meet similar needs, and some locales&mdash;Venice, in particular&mdash;benefitted significantly in economic terms.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It goes without saying that the crusades also had a highly negative effect on interfaith relations.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Impact world-wide</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Fourth, the crusading movement has left an imprint on the world as a whole. For example, many of the national flags of Europe incorporate a cross. In addition, &nbsp;many images of crusaders in our popular culture are indebted to the nineteenth century. Some in that century, like the novelist Sir Walter Scott, portrayed crusaders as brave and glamorous yet backward and unenlightened; simultaneously, they depicted Muslims&nbsp;as heroic, intelligent, and liberal. Others more wholeheartedly romanticized crusading.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\t<li><strong>Time:</strong> time is calculated very conservatively and includes all time students have spent actively engaged in the material, including both videos and skills.

"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>GCD(A,0) = A</li>\n"

"\t<li><strong>If A = B&sdot;Q + R and B&ne;0 then GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R) </strong>where Q is an integer, R is an integer between 0 and B-1</li>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The first two properties let us find the GCD if either number is 0. The third property lets us take a larger, more difficult to solve problem, and <strong>reduce it to a smaller, easier to solve problem</strong>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Euclidean Algorithm makes use of these properties by rapidly reducing the problem into easier and easier problems, using the third property, &nbsp;until it is easily solved by using one of the first two properties.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We can understand why these properties work by proving them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We can prove that GCD(A,0)=A is as follows:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>The largest integer that can evenly divide A is A.</li>\n"
"\t<li>All integers evenly divide 0, since for any integer, C, we can write C &sdot; 0 = 0. So we can conclude that A must evenly divide 0.</li>\n"
"\t<li>The greatest number that divides both A and 0 is A.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p><strong>Proof that the GCD(A,B) evenly divides C</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The GCD(A,B), by definition, evenly divides A. As a result, A must be some multiple of GCD(A,B). i.e. X&sdot;GCD(A,B)=A where X is some integer</p>\n"

"<p>The GCD(A,B), by definition, evenly divides B. As a result, &nbsp;B must be some multiple of GCD(A,B). i.e. Y&sdot;GCD(A,B)=B where Y is some integer</p>\n"

"<p>Roman architecture was unlike anything that had come before. The Persians, Egyptians, Greeks and Etruscans all had monumental architecture. The grandeur of their buildings, though, was largely external. Buildings were designed to be impressive when viewed from outside because their architects all had to rely on building in a post-and-lintel system, which means that they used two upright posts, like columns, with a horizontal block, known as a lintel, laid flat across the top. A good example is this ancient Greek Temple in Paestum, Italy.</p>\n"

Thanks to these innovations, from the first century&nbsp;C.E. Romans were able to create interior spaces that had previously been unheard of. Romans became increasingly concerned with shaping interior space rather than filling it with structural supports. As a result, the inside of Roman buildings were as impressive as their exteriors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Materials, Methods and Innovations</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Long before concrete made its appearance on the building scene in Rome, the Romans utilized a volcanic stone native to Italy called tufa to construct their buildings. Although tufa never went out of use, travertine began to be utilized in the late 2nd century&nbsp;B.C.E. because it was more durable. Also, its off-white color made it an acceptable substitute for marble.</p>\n"

"c. 120-80 B.C.E., &nbsp;structure is&nbsp;travertine and&nbsp;tufa,&nbsp;stuccoed to look like Greek marble,&nbsp;Rome</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Marble was slow to catch on in Rome during the Republican period since it was seen as an extravagance, but after the reign of Augustus (31 B.C.E. - 14 C.E.), marble became quite fashionable. Augustus had famously claimed in his funerary inscription, known as the <em>Res Gestae</em>, that he &ldquo;found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble&rdquo; referring to his ambitious building campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman concrete (<em>opus caementicium</em>), was developed early in the 2nd c. BCE. &nbsp;The use of mortar as a bonding agent in ashlar masonry wasn&rsquo;t new in the ancient world; mortar was a combination of sand, lime and water in proper proportions. The major contribution the Romans made to the mortar recipe was the introduction of volcanic Italian sand (also known as &ldquo;pozzolana&rdquo;). &nbsp;The Roman builders who used pozzolana rather than ordinary sand noticed that their mortar was incredibly strong and durable. It also had the ability to set underwater. Brick and tile were commonly plastered over the concrete since it was not considered very pretty on its own, but concrete&rsquo;s structural possibilities were far more important. The invention of <em>opus caementicium</em> initiated the Roman architectural revolution, allowing for builders to be much more creative with their designs. Since concrete takes the shape&nbsp;of the mold or frame it is poured into, buildings began to take on ever more fluid and creative shapes.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Romans also exploited the opportunities afforded to architects by the innovation of the true arch (as opposed to a corbeled arch where&nbsp;stones are laid so that they move slightly in toward the center as they move higher).&nbsp;A true&nbsp;arch is composed of wedge-shaped blocks (typically of a durable stone), called voussoirs, with a key stone in the center holding them into place. In a true&nbsp;arch, weight is transferred from one voussoir down to the next, from the top of the arch to ground level, creating a sturdy building tool. True arches&nbsp;can span greater distances than a simple post-and-lintel.&nbsp;The use of concrete, combined with the employment of true arches allowed for vaults and domes to be built, creating expansive and breathtaking interior spaces.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Roman Architects</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about Roman architects. &nbsp;Few individual architects are known to us because the dedicatory inscriptions, which appear on finished buildings, usually commemorated the person who commissioned and paid for the structure. We do know that architects came from all walks of life, from freedmen all the way up to the Emperor Hadrian, and they were responsible for all aspects of building on a project. The architect would design the building and act as engineer; he would serve as contractor and supervisor and would attempt to keep the project within budget.</p>\n"

"<p>Roman cities were typically focused on the forum (a large open plaza, surrounded by important buildings), which was the civic, religious and economic heart of the city. It was in the city&rsquo;s forum that major temples (such as a Capitoline temple, dedicated to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva) were located, as well as other important shrines. Also useful in the forum plan were the basilica&nbsp;(a law court), and other official meeting places for the town council, such as a curia building. Quite often the city&rsquo;s meat, fish and vegetable markets sprang up around the bustling forum. Surrounding the forum, lining the city&rsquo;s streets, framing gateways, and marking crossings stood the connective architecture of the city: the porticoes, colonnades, arches and fountains that beautified a Roman city and welcomed weary travelers to town. Pompeii, Italy is an excellent example of a city with a well preserved forum. &nbsp;</p>\n"

The temple was erected from local tufa on a high podium and what is most characteristic is its frontality. The porch is very deep and the visitor is meant to approach from only one access point, rather than walk all the way around, as was common in Greek temples. Also, the presence of three cellas, or cult rooms, was also unique. The Temple of Jupiter would remain influential in temple design for much of the Republican period. &nbsp;</p>\n"

The architects, Severus and Celer, are known (thanks to the Roman historian Tacitus), and they built a grand palace, complete with courtyards, dining rooms, colonnades and fountains.

"<p>Roman architecture was unlike anything that had come before. The Persians, Egyptians, Greeks and Etruscans all had monumental architecture. The grandeur of their buildings, though, was largely external. Buildings were designed to be impressive when viewed from outside because their architects all had to rely on building in a post-and-lintel system, which means that they used two upright posts, like columns, with a horizontal block, known as a lintel, laid flat across the top. A good example is this ancient Greek Temple in Paestum, Italy.</p>\n"

Thanks to these innovations, from the first century&nbsp;C.E. Romans were able to create interior spaces that had previously been unheard of. Romans became increasingly concerned with shaping interior space rather than filling it with structural supports. As a result, the inside of Roman buildings were as impressive as their exteriors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Materials, Methods and Innovations</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Long before concrete made its appearance on the building scene in Rome, the Romans utilized a volcanic stone native to Italy called tufa to construct their buildings. Although tufa never went out of use, travertine began to be utilized in the late 2nd century&nbsp;B.C.E. because it was more durable. Also, its off-white color made it an acceptable substitute for marble.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Marble was slow to catch on in Rome during the Republican period since it was seen as an extravagance, but after the reign of Augustus (31 B.C.E. - 14 C.E.), marble became quite fashionable. Augustus had famously claimed in his funerary inscription, known as the <em>Res Gestae</em>, that he &ldquo;found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble&rdquo; referring to his ambitious building campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman concrete (<em>opus caementicium</em>), was developed early in the 2nd c. BCE. &nbsp;The use of mortar as a bonding agent in ashlar masonry wasn&rsquo;t new in the ancient world; mortar was a combination of sand, lime and water in proper proportions. The major contribution the Romans made to the mortar recipe was the introduction of volcanic Italian sand (also known as &ldquo;pozzolana&rdquo;). &nbsp;The Roman builders who used pozzolana rather than ordinary sand noticed that their mortar was incredibly strong and durable. It also had the ability to set underwater. Brick and tile were commonly plastered over the concrete since it was not considered very pretty on its own, but concrete&rsquo;s structural possibilities were far more important. The invention of <em>opus caementicium</em> initiated the Roman architectural revolution, allowing for builders to be much more creative with their designs. Since concrete takes the shape&nbsp;of the mold or frame it is poured into, buildings began to take on ever more fluid and creative shapes.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Romans also exploited the opportunities afforded to architects by the innovation of the true arch (as opposed to a corbeled arch where&nbsp;stones are laid so that they move slightly in toward the center as they move higher).&nbsp;A true&nbsp;arch is composed of wedge-shaped blocks (typically of a durable stone), called voussoirs, with a key stone in the center holding them into place. In a true&nbsp;arch, weight is transferred from one voussoir down to the next, from the top of the arch to ground level, creating a sturdy building tool. True arches&nbsp;can span greater distances than a simple post-and-lintel.&nbsp;The use of concrete, combined with the employment of true arches allowed for vaults and domes to be built, creating expansive and breathtaking interior spaces.</p>\n"

"<h3>Roman Architects</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about Roman architects. &nbsp;Few individual architects are known to us because the dedicatory inscriptions, which appear on finished buildings, usually commemorated the person who commissioned and paid for the structure. We do know that architects came from all walks of life, from freedmen all the way up to the Emperor Hadrian, and they were responsible for all aspects of building on a project. The architect would design the building and act as engineer; he would serve as contractor and supervisor and would attempt to keep the project within budget.</p>\n"

"<p>Roman cities were typically focused on the forum (a large open plaza, surrounded by important buildings), which was the civic, religious and economic heart of the city. It was in the city&rsquo;s forum that major temples (such as a Capitoline temple, dedicated to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva) were located, as well as other important shrines. Also useful in the forum plan were the basilica&nbsp;(a law court), and other official meeting places for the town council, such as a curia building. Quite often the city&rsquo;s meat, fish and vegetable markets sprang up around the bustling forum. Surrounding the forum, lining the city&rsquo;s streets, framing gateways, and marking crossings stood the connective architecture of the city: the porticoes, colonnades, arches and fountains that beautified a Roman city and welcomed weary travelers to town. Pompeii, Italy is an excellent example of a city with a well preserved forum. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Romans had a wide range of housing. The wealthy could own a house (<em>domus</em>) in the city as well as a country farmhouse (<em>villa</em>), while the less fortunate lived in multi-story apartment buildings called <em>insulae</em>. The House of Diana in Ostia, Rome&rsquo;s port city, from the late 2nd c. C.E. is a great example of an insula. Even in death, the Romans found the need to construct grand buildings to commemorate and house their remains, like Eurysaces the Baker, whose elaborate tomb still stands near the Porta Maggiore in Rome.</p>\n"

"<p>The Romans built aqueducts throughout their domain and introduced water into the cities they built and occupied, increasing sanitary conditions. &nbsp;A ready supply of water also allowed bath houses to become standard features of Roman cities, from Timgad, Algeria to Bath, England. &nbsp;A healthy Roman lifestyle also included trips to the gymnasium. &nbsp;Quite often, in the Imperial period, grand gymnasium-bath complexes were built and funded by the state, such as the Baths of Caracalla which included running tracks, gardens and libraries.</p>\n"

"<p>Entertainment varied greatly to suit all tastes in Rome, necessitating the erection of many types of structures. &nbsp;There were Greek style theaters for plays as well as smaller, more intimate odeon buildings, like the one in Pompeii, which were specifically designed for musical performances. &nbsp;The Romans also built amphitheaters&mdash;elliptical, enclosed spaces such as the Colloseum&mdash;which were used for gladiatorial combats or battles between men and animals. The Romans also built a circus in many of their cities. The circuses, such as the one in Lepcis Magna, Libya, were venues for residents to watch chariot racing. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The Romans continued to perfect their bridge building and road laying skills as well, allowing them to cross rivers and gullies and traverse great distances in order to expand their empire and better supervise it.&nbsp;From the bridge in Alc&aacute;ntara, Spain to the paved roads in Petra, Jordan, the Romans moved messages, money and troops efficiently. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

The Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill in Rome, begun in the late 6th century&nbsp;B.C.E., bears all the hallmarks of Etruscan architecture. The temple was erected from local tufa on a high podium and what is most characteristic is its frontality. The porch is very deep and the visitor is meant to approach from only one access point, rather than walk all the way around, as was common in Greek temples. Also, the presence of three cellas, or cult rooms, was also unique. The Temple of Jupiter would remain influential in temple design for much of the Republican period. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia in modern day Palestrina is comprised of two complexes, an upper and a lower one.

The entire compound is intricately woven together to manipulate the visitor&rsquo;s experience of sight, daylight and the approach to the sanctuary itself.

The plaques down the front of the sounding box are made of shell. The silver cow's head decorating the front has inlaid eyes of shell and lapis lazuli. The edges of the sound box have a narrow border of shell and lapis lazuli inlay.  When found, the lyre lay in the soil. The metal was very brittle and the uprights were squashed flat. First it was photographed, and then covered in wax and waxed cloth to hold it together for lifting. The silver on the top and back edge of the sounding box had been destroyed. Some of the silver preserved the impression of matting on which it must have originally lain. Eleven silver tubes acted as the tuning pegs.  Such instruments were probably important parts of rituals at court and temple.

Some concern the provision of the funerary cult that was celebrated in the tomb-chapel, some show scenes of Nebamun&rsquo;s life as an elite official, and others show him and his family enjoying life for all eternity, as in the famous scene of the family hunting in the marshes. Together they decorated the small tomb-chapel with vibrant and engaging images of an elite lifestyle that Nebamun hoped would continue in the afterlife.</p>\n"

"<p>Nebamun is shown hunting birds, in a small boat with his wife Hatshepsut and their young daughter, in the marshes of the Nile.

"<p>This is more than a simple image of recreation. Fertile marshes were seen as a place of rebirth and eroticism.

"<p>This course&nbsp;is all about looking at the world around us and coming up with clever ways to simulate that world with code. We will start by looking at basic physics&mdash;how an apple falls from a tree, how a pendulum swings in the air, how the earth revolves around the sun, etc. Everything that we&#39;ll discuss here&nbsp;requires the use of the most basic building block for programming motion&mdash;the <strong><em>vector</em></strong>. And so this is where we begin our story.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now, the word vector can mean a lot of different things. Vector is the name of a New Wave rock band formed in Sacramento, CA in the early 1980s. It&rsquo;s the name of a breakfast cereal manufactured by Kellogg&rsquo;s Canada. In the field of epidemiology, a vector is used to describe an organism that transmits infection from one host to another. In the C++ programming language, a vector (std::vector) is an implementation of a dynamically resizable array data structure. While all these definitions are interesting, they&rsquo;re not what we&rsquo;re looking for. What we want is called a <strong><em>Euclidean vector</em></strong> (named for the Greek mathematician Euclid and also known as a geometric vector). When you see the term &ldquo;vector&rdquo; in this course, you can assume it refers to a Euclidean vector, defined as <em>an entity that has both magnitude and direction</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A vector is typically drawn as a arrow; the direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and the magnitude by the length of the arrow itself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"A diagram of a vector with magnitude and direction\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/60b0a7768992ead88f8fe12d834a1310d6dbcb27.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.1: A vector (drawn as an arrow) has magnitude (length of arrow) and direction (which way it is pointing).</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the above illustration, the vector is drawn as an arrow from point A to point B and serves as an instruction for how to travel from A to B.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why use vectors?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before we dive into more of the details about vectors, let&rsquo;s look at a basic program that demonstrates why we should care about vectors in the first place. If you went through the introductory JS course here on Khan Academy, you probably, at one point or another, learned how to write a simple bouncing ball program.</p>\n"

"<p>In the above example, we have a very simple world&mdash;a blank canvas with a circular shape (a &ldquo;ball&rdquo;) traveling around. This ball has some properties, which are represented in the code as variables.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s becoming clearer that for every concept in this world (wind, location, acceleration, etc.), we&rsquo;ll need two variables. And this is only a two-dimensional world. In a 3D world, we&rsquo;ll need <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>xspeed</code>, <code>yspeed</code>, <code>zspeed</code>, and so on.</p>\n"

"<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could simplify our code and use fewer variables?</p>\n"

"<pre>\n"
"<code>var x = 5;\n"
"var y = 10;\n"
"var xspeed;\n"
"var yspeed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We could simply have two variables, where each variable is a vector-like object with two dimensions of information:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var location;\n"
"var speed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Taking this first step in using vectors won&rsquo;t allow us to do anything new. Just using vector-like objects for your variables won&rsquo;t magically make your program simulate physics. However, they will simplify your code and provide a set of functions for common mathematical operations that happen over and over and over again while programming motion.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As an introduction to vectors, we&rsquo;re going to live in two dimensions.

"<p>We should note an important aspect of the above transition to programming with vectors.

"<p>The <code>ellipse()</code> function does not allow for a <code>PVector</code> as an argument. An ellipse can only be drawn with two scalar values, an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate.

"<p>Now, you might feel somewhat disappointed. After all, this change to using vectors may initially appear to have made the code more complicated than the original version. While this is a perfectly reasonable and valid critique, it&rsquo;s important to understand that we haven&rsquo;t fully realized the power of programming with vectors just yet. Looking at a simple bouncing ball and only implementing vector addition is just the first step. As we move forward into a more complex world of multiple objects and multiple <strong><em>forces</em></strong> (which we&rsquo;ll introduce soon), the benefits of <code>PVector</code> will become more apparent.

"<p>This course&nbsp;is all about looking at the world around us and coming up with clever ways to simulate that world with code. We will start by looking at basic physics&mdash;how an apple falls from a tree, how a pendulum swings in the air, how the earth revolves around the sun, etc. Everything that we&#39;ll discuss here&nbsp;requires the use of the most basic building block for programming motion&mdash;the <strong><em>vector</em></strong>. And so this is where we begin our story.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now, the word vector can mean a lot of different things. Vector is the name of a New Wave rock band formed in Sacramento, CA in the early 1980s. It&rsquo;s the name of a breakfast cereal manufactured by Kellogg&rsquo;s Canada. In the field of epidemiology, a vector is used to describe an organism that transmits infection from one host to another. In the C++ programming language, a vector (std::vector) is an implementation of a dynamically resizable array data structure. While all these definitions are interesting, they&rsquo;re not what we&rsquo;re looking for. What we want is called a <strong><em>Euclidean vector</em></strong> (named for the Greek mathematician Euclid and also known as a geometric vector). When you see the term &ldquo;vector&rdquo; in this course, you can assume it refers to a Euclidean vector, defined as <em>an entity that has both magnitude and direction</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A vector is typically drawn as a arrow; the direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and the magnitude by the length of the arrow itself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"A diagram of a vector with magnitude and direction\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/60b0a7768992ead88f8fe12d834a1310d6dbcb27.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.1: A vector (drawn as an arrow) has magnitude (length of arrow) and direction (which way it is pointing).</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the above illustration, the vector is drawn as an arrow from point A to point B and serves as an instruction for how to travel from A to B.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why use vectors?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before we dive into more of the details about vectors, let&rsquo;s look at a basic program that demonstrates why we should care about vectors in the first place. If you went through the introductory JS course here on Khan Academy, you probably, at one point or another, learned how to write a simple bouncing ball program.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><iframe class=\"scratchpad\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"440\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/bouncing-ball-without-pvector/6602409044344832/embedded?embed=yes&amp;article=yes&amp;editor=yes&amp;buttons=yes&amp;author=yes\" width=\"790\"></iframe></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the above example, we have a very simple world&mdash;a blank canvas with a circular shape (a &ldquo;ball&rdquo;) traveling around. This ball has some properties, which are represented in the code as variables.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"table\">\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>場所</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>x and y</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Velocity</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xspeed and yspeed</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In a more advanced program, we could imagine having many more variables:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"table\">\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Acceleration</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xacceleration and yacceleration</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Target location</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xtarget and ytarget</em></td>\n"

"\t\t\t<td>Friction</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xfriction and yfriction</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s becoming clearer that for every concept in this world (wind, location, acceleration, etc.), we&rsquo;ll need two variables. And this is only a two-dimensional world. In a 3D world, we&rsquo;ll need <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>xspeed</code>, <code>yspeed</code>, <code>zspeed</code>, and so on.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could simplify our code and use fewer variables?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Instead of:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var x = 5;\n"
"var y = 10;\n"
"var xspeed;\n"
"var yspeed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We could simply have two variables, where each variable is a vector-like object with two dimensions of information:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var location;\n"
"var speed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Taking this first step in using vectors won&rsquo;t allow us to do anything new. Just using vector-like objects for your variables won&rsquo;t magically make your program simulate physics. However, they will simplify your code and provide a set of functions for common mathematical operations that happen over and over and over again while programming motion.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As an introduction to vectors, we&rsquo;re going to live in two dimensions. All of these examples can be fairly easily extended to three dimensions (and the object we will use&mdash;<code>PVector</code>&mdash;allows for three dimensions.)

Looking at a simple bouncing ball and only implementing vector addition is just the first step.

"<p>What does the Taj Mahal have to do with the Tamerlane? What do Persian carpets have to do with Turkish tiles? Quite a bit, as it turns out. By the fourteenth century, Islam had spread as far East as India and Islamic rulers had solidified their power by establishing prosperous cities and a robust trade in decorative arts along the all-important Silk Road.&nbsp;This is a complex period with competing and overlapping cultures and empires. Read below for an introduction to the later Islamic dynasties.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ottoman (1300-1924)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At its earliest stages, the Ottoman state was little more than a group formed as a result of the dissolution of the Anatolian Seljuq sultanate. However, in 1453, the Ottomans captured the great Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and in 1517, they defeated the Mamluks and took control of the most significant state in the Islamic world.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mimar Sinan, Süleymaniye Mosque built for the Sultan Süleyman the Lawgiver, 1558, Istanbul\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/817ed1bd1be8379d1a2e141af26e5d413d5aecf6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Mimar Sinan, S&uuml;leymaniye Mosque built for the Sultan S&uuml;leyman the Lawgiver, 1558, Istanbul</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the Ottomans ruled for many centuries, the height of the empire&#39;s cultural and economic prosperity was achieved during S&uuml;leyman the Magnificent&#39;s reign (r. 1520-1566), a period often referred to as the Ottoman&#39;s &lsquo;golden age.&rsquo; In addition to large-scale architectural projects, the decorative arts flourished, chief among them, ceramics, particularly tiles. Iznik tiles, named for the city in Anatolia where they were produced, developed a trademark style of curling vines and flowers rendered in beautiful shades of blue and turquoise. These designs were informed by the blue and white floral patterns found in Chinese porcelain&mdash;similar to earlier Mamluk tiles, and Timurid art to the East. In addition to Iznik, other artistic hubs developed, such as Bursa, known for its silks, and Cairo for its carpets. The capital, Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), became a great center for all matters of cultural importance from manuscript illumination to architecture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Sinan, Rüstem Paşa Mosque, mihrab and minbar \n"

"\n"
"<p>The architecture of the period, both sacred and secular, incorporates these decorative arts, from the dazzling blue tiles and monumental calligraphy that adorn the walls of Topkapi Palace (begun 1459) to the carpets that line the floors of the S&uuml;leymaniye Mosque (1550-1558). Ottoman mosque architecture itself is marked by the use of domes, widely used earlier in Byzantium, and towering minarets. The Byzantine influence draws primarily from Hagia Sophia, a former church that was <a href=\"/humanities/medieval-world/byzantine1/constantinople-east/v/hagia-sophia-mosque\">converted into a mosque</a> (and is now a museum).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Timurid (1369-1502)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/73129983bd866cd1ea05fb6d632a90d2c01cf536.png\" /><br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-caption\">Timurid Dynasty at its greatest extent</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This powerful Central Asian dynasty was named for its founder, Tamerlane (ruled 1370-1405), which is derived from Timur the Lame. Despite his rather pathetic epithet, he claimed to be a descendent of Genghis Khan and demonstrated some of his supposed ancestor&rsquo;s ruthlessness in conquering neighboring territories.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After establishing a vast empire, Timur developed a monumental architecture befitting his power, and sought to make Samarkand the &ldquo;pearl of the world.&rdquo; Because the capital was situated at a major crossroads of the Silk Road (the crucial trade route linking the Middle East, Central Asia, and China), and because Timur had conquered so widely, the Timurids acquired a myriad of artisans and craftspeople from distinct artistic traditions. The resulting style synthesized aesthetic and design principles from as far away as India (then Hindustan) and the lands in between.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/07c17fea1d543b4a018d924ea304e03ff154350f.jpg\" /><br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-caption\">Registan, Samarkand, Uzbekistan, 15th-17th centuries</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The result can be seen in cities filled with buildings created on a lavish scale that exhibited tall, bulbous domes and the finest ceramic tiles. The structures and even the cities themselves are often described foremost by the overwhelming use of blues and golds. While the Timurid dynasty itself was short-lived, its legacy survives not only in the grand architecture that it left behind but in its descendents who went on to play significant roles in the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal empires.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Safavid (1502-1736)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Safavids, a group with roots in the Sufic tradition (a mystical branch of Islam), came to power in Persia, modern-day Iran and Azerbaijan. In 1501 the Safavid rulers declared Shi&rsquo;a Islam as its state religion; and in just ten years the empire came to include all of Iran.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The art of manuscript illumination was highly prized in the Safavid courts, and royal patrons made many large-scale commissions. Perhaps the most notable of these is the Shahnama (or &lsquo;Book of Kings,&rsquo; a compilation of stories about earlier rulers of Iran) from the 1520s. While painting in this context did not have the same prominent and longstanding tradition as it does in Western art, the illustrations exhibit masterful workmanship and an incredible attention to detail.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Trade in carpets was also important, and even today, people understand the appeal of Persian carpets. These large-scale, high-quality pieces were created as luxurious furnishings for royal&nbsp;courts. The most famous&mdash;perhaps of all time&mdash;is a pair known as the Ardabil Carpets, created in 1539-1540. The carpets were nearly identical, perfectly symmetrical and enormous. Every inch of space was filled with flowers, scrolling vines, and medallions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The empire began to struggle financially and militarily until the rule of Shah Abbas (r. 1587-1629). He moved the capital to Isfahan where he built a magnificent new city and established state workshops for textiles, which, along with silk and other goods, were increasingly exported to Europe. The mosque architecture made use of earlier Persian elements, like the four-iwan plan and building materials of brick and glazed tiles reminiscent of Timurid architecture, with its blues and greens and bulbous domes. Even in such far-removed lands, the connections between these dynasties are evident in the art they created.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Mughal (1526-1858)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Though Islam had been introduced in India centuries before, the Mughals were responsible for some of the greatest works of art produced in the canons of both Indian and Islamic art. The empire established itself when Babur, himself a Timurid prince of Turkish and Central Asian descent, came to Hindustan and defeated the existing Islamic sultanate in Delhi.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tracing their roots to Central Asia, the Mughals produced art, music and poetry that was highly influenced by Persian and Central Asian aesthetics. This is evident in the style and importance given to miniature paintings, created to illustrate manuscripts. The most grandiose of these was the Akbarnama, created to record the conquests of Akbar, widely regarded as the greatest Mughal emperor. The art and architecture created during his reign demonstrate a synthesis of indigenous Indian temple architecture with structural and design elements derived from Islamic sources farther West. The Mughals developed a unique architectural style which, in the years after Akbar&rsquo;s reign, began to feature scalloped arches and stylized floral designs in white marble. The most famous example is the Taj Mahal, constructed by Shah Jahan from 1632-1653.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Taj Mahal, Agra, India, 1632-53\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6e43b8c6ad1cc49db1f5eb3334df58f36d5fac14.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Taj Mahal, Agra, India, 1632-53, photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mknott/1352093343\">Mathew Knott</a>&nbsp;(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Mughal dynasty left a lasting mark on the landscape of India, and remained in power until the British completed their conquest of India in the nineteenth century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although historians generally agree that the major Islamic dynasties end in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Islamic art and culture have continued to flourish. Muslim artists and Muslim countries are still producing art. Some art historians consider such work as simply modern or contemporary art while others see it within the continuity of Islamic art.</p>\n"

"<h3>Visiting a bookseller</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The similarities run much further than mere physical traits, however. Take for example the manner in which the book was made and acquired from the 13th century onwards. If you wanted a book in the later Middle Ages you went to a store, as in our modern day. However, the bookseller did not normally have any books in stock&mdash;except for perhaps some second-hand copies. You would tell him what you wanted, both content-wise and with respect to the object&rsquo;s material features. You could specify, for example, that he use paper (instead of parchment), cursive script (and not book script) and add miniatures (or forego&nbsp;decoration). Just like so many other objects you bought in late-medieval society, the commercially-made manuscript was custom-tailored to the individual who purchased it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The professionals who made books for profit were usually found near the biggest church in town. This was a well-chosen spot as canons and clerics (i.e. people who visited the church and who could read) formed an important part of the clientele. By the 14th century true communities of the book had formed in the neighborhoods around churches and cathedrals. Evidence from such cities as Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, London and Paris suggests that in these communities a diverse group of artisans interacted with clients and with each other. It was a world bound not only by the book, however, but also by profit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Marketing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Whether you were scribe, illuminator or binder, as a professional you would strive for quality and diversity as this ensured bread and butter on the table. In parallel to our modern book business, medieval manuscript artisans used various marketing strategies to attract new clientele. The most striking of these is advertisements.

"\n"
"<p>This centralization was equally convenient, however, for the artisans themselves. Booksellers (also called stationers) in Rue Neuve Notre Dame and in other such &ldquo;book streets&rdquo; in European cities depended on the professional scribes, illuminators and binders that lived in their vicinity. They would hire them for various projects. When a client came to order a book from a stationer, the latter would divide the work among the artisans he usually worked with. One copied the text, another drew the images, and a third bound the book. These hired hands were given contracts which specified precisely what they would have to do and how much money they received for it. From time to time the stationer would come and check on the progress they made. In some manuscripts these cost estimates were scribbled in the margin.&nbsp;Although making books for profit was a common scenario in the later Middle Ages, it did not make you particularly rich.

"<p>The&nbsp;world of professional medieval scribes&nbsp;was shaken up by the coming of Gutenberg&rsquo;s printing press&nbsp;around the middle of the 15th century.

"<h3>Visiting a bookseller</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The similarities run much further than mere physical traits, however. Take for example the manner in which the book was made and acquired from the 13th century onwards. If you wanted a book in the later Middle Ages you went to a store, as in our modern day. However, the bookseller did not normally have any books in stock&mdash;except for perhaps some second-hand copies. You would tell him what you wanted, both content-wise and with respect to the object&rsquo;s material features. You could specify, for example, that he use paper (instead of parchment), cursive script (and not book script) and add miniatures (or forego&nbsp;decoration). Just like so many other objects you bought in late-medieval society, the commercially-made manuscript was custom-tailored to the individual who purchased it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The professionals who made books for profit were usually found near the biggest church in town. This was a well-chosen spot as canons and clerics (i.e. people who visited the church and who could read) formed an important part of the clientele. By the 14th century true communities of the book had formed in the neighborhoods around churches and cathedrals. Evidence from such cities as Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, London and Paris suggests that in these communities a diverse group of artisans interacted with clients and with each other. It was a world bound not only by the book, however, but also by profit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Marketing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Whether you were scribe, illuminator or binder, as a professional you would strive for quality and diversity as this ensured bread and butter on the table. In parallel to our modern book business, medieval manuscript artisans used various marketing strategies to attract new clientele. The most striking of these is advertisements. Scribes hung large sheets outside their doors to show what kind of scripts they had mastered. The short writing samples found on these sheets were often accompanied by the names of the scripts, which shows just how professional the world of the book had become. A particularly rich specimen survives from the shop of Herman Strepel, a professional scribe in M&uuml;nster (c. 1447).

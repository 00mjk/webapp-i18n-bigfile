"<p>The Inka capital Cusco and principal outlying towns of the Inka Empire were organized around a public plaza with a specially-constructed platform placed facing a designated sacred central space called the <em>ushnu</em>. This sacred space was marked by a vertical opening into the body of the earth into which liquid and other offerings were made.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The&nbsp;ushnu&nbsp;platform was therefore&nbsp;a kind of stage from which the Inka king and his&nbsp;lords could observe and rule&nbsp;over&nbsp;an annual round of seasonal festivals and ceremonial events.<br />\n"

"The ushnu here is situated on the summit of the mountain and comprises three superimposed platforms. The basal one is little more than a rectangular outline of rocks, barely a single rock in height but measuring 32.7m by 18.5m. The second platform consists of a single faced wall, measuring 24.5 m by 11.4m.\n"
"\n"
"The third and final platform is contained within a double-faced wall, and measures 22.8m in length by 9.6m in width. The walls are built out of grey andesite which appears to have been quarried nearby.\n"

"<h3>Rock art and the origins of art in Africa</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The oldest scientifically-dated rock art in Africa dates from around 26,000-28,000 years ago and is found in Namibia.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Between 1969 and 1972, German archaeologist, W.E. Wendt, researching in an area known locally as &quot;Goachanas,&quot; unearthed several painted slabs in a cave he named Apollo 11, after NASA&rsquo;s successful moon landing mission.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Seven painted stone slabs of brown-grey quartzite, depicting a variety of animals painted in charcoal, ochre and white, were located in a Middle Stone Age deposit&nbsp;(100,000&ndash;60,000 years ago). These images are not easily identifiable to species level, but have been interpreted variously as felines and/or bovids; one in particular has been observed to be either a zebra, giraffe or ostrich, demonstrating the ambiguous nature of the depictions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Art and our modern mind</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the Apollo 11 plaques may be the oldest discovered representational art in Africa, this is not the beginning of the story of art. It is now well-established, through genetic and fossil evidence, that anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) developed in Africa more than 100,000 years ago; of these, a small group left the Continent around 60,000-80,000 years ago and spread throughout the rest of the world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Recently discovered examples of patterned stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell, as well as evidence of personal ornamentation emerging from Middle Stone Age Africa, have demonstrated that &quot;art&quot;&nbsp;is not only a much older phenomenon than previously thought, but that it has its roots in the African continent. Africa is where we share a common humanity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first examples of what we might term &quot;art&quot;&nbsp;in Africa, dating from between 100,000&ndash;60,000 years ago, emerge in two very distinct forms: personal adornment in the form of perforated seashells suspended on twine, and incised and engraved stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell. Despite some sites being 8,000km and 40,000 years apart, an intriguing feature of the earliest art is that these first forays appear remarkably similar. It is worth noting here that the term &quot;art&quot;&nbsp;in this context is highly problematic, in that we cannot assume that humans living 100,000 years ago, or even 10,000 years ago, had a concept of art in the same way that we do, particularly in the modern Western sense. However, it remains a useful umbrella term for our purposes here.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Incised ochre from Blombos Cave, South Africa. Photo by Chris. S. Henshilwood © Chris. S.

"\n"
"<p>The practice of engraving or incising, which emerges around 12,000 years ago in Saharan rock art, has its antecedents much earlier, up to 100,000 years ago. Incised and engraved stone, bone, ochre and ostrich eggshell have been found at sites in southern Africa. These marked objects share features in the expression of design, exhibiting patterns that have been classified as cross-hatching.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One of the most iconic and well-publicised sites that have yielded cross-hatch incised patterning on ochre is Blombos Cave, on the southern Cape shore of South Africa. Of the more than 8,500 fragments of ochre deriving from the MSA (Middle Stone AGe) levels, 15 fragments show evidence of engraving. Two of these, dated to 77,000 years ago, have received the most attention for the design of cross-hatch pattern.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For many archaeologists, the incised pieces of ochre at Blombos are the most complex and best-formed evidence for early abstract representations, and are unequivocal evidence for symbolic thought and language. The debate about when we became a symbolic species and acquired fully syntactical language &ndash; what archaeologists term &lsquo;modern human behaviour&rsquo; &ndash; is both complex and contested. It has been proposed that these cross-hatch patterns are clear evidence of thinking symbolically, because the motifs are not representational and as such are culturally constructed and arbitrary. Moreover, in order for the meaning of this motif to be conveyed to others, language is a prerequisite.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Blombos engravings are not isolated occurrences, since the presence of such designs occur at more than half a dozen other sites in South Africa, suggesting that this pattern is indeed important in some way, and not the result of idiosyncratic behaviour. It is worth noting, however, that for some scholars, the premise that the pattern is symbolic is not so certain. The patterns may indeed have a meaning, but it is how that meaning is associated, either by resemblance (iconic) or correlation (indexical), that is important for our understanding of human cognition.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Personal ornamentation and engraved designs are the earliest evidence of art in Africa, and are inextricably tied up with the development of human cognition. For tens of thousands of years, there has been not only a capacity for, but a motivation to adorn and to inscribe, to make visual that which is important. The interesting and pertinent issue in the context of this project is that the rock art we are cataloguing, describing and researching comes from a tradition that goes far back into African prehistory. The techniques and subject matter resonate over the millennia.</p>\n"

Two of these, dated to 77,000 years ago, have received the most attention for the design of cross-hatch pattern.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For many archaeologists, the incised pieces of ochre at Blombos are the most complex and best-formed evidence for early abstract representations, and are unequivocal evidence for symbolic thought and language. The debate about when we became a symbolic species and acquired fully syntactical language &ndash; what archaeologists term &lsquo;modern human behaviour&rsquo; &ndash; is both complex and contested. It has been proposed that these cross-hatch patterns are clear evidence of thinking symbolically, because the motifs are not representational and as such are culturally constructed and arbitrary. Moreover, in order for the meaning of this motif to be conveyed to others, language is a prerequisite.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Blombos engravings are not isolated occurrences, since the presence of such designs occur at more than half a dozen other sites in South Africa, suggesting that this pattern is indeed important in some way, and not the result of idiosyncratic behaviour. It is worth noting, however, that for some scholars, the premise that the pattern is symbolic is not so certain. The patterns may indeed have a meaning, but it is how that meaning is associated, either by resemblance (iconic) or correlation (indexical), that is important for our understanding of human cognition.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Personal ornamentation and engraved designs are the earliest evidence of art in Africa, and are inextricably tied up with the development of human cognition. For tens of thousands of years, there has been not only a capacity for, but a motivation to adorn and to inscribe, to make visual that which is important. The interesting and pertinent issue in the context of this project is that the rock art we are cataloguing, describing and researching comes from a tradition that goes far back into African prehistory. The techniques and subject matter resonate over the millennia.</p>\n"

This situates the inspiration for the sarcophagus squarely in the convivial (social)&nbsp;sphere and, as we are often reminded, conviviality was central to Etruscan mortuary rituals. Etruscan funerary art&mdash;including painted tombs&mdash;often depicts scenes of revelry, perhaps as a reminder of the funeral banquet that would send the deceased off to the afterlife or perhaps to reflect the notion of perpetual conviviality in said afterlife.

The terracotta plaque from Poggio Civitate,&nbsp;Murlo (above), for instance, that is roughly contemporary to the sarcophagus of the spouses shows a close iconographic parallel for this custom. This cultural custom generated some resentment&mdash;even animus&mdash;on the part of Greek and Latin authors in antiquity who saw this Etruscan practice not just as different, but took it as offensive behavior.

"\n"
"<p>The <em>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</em> is a masterwork of terracotta sculpture. Painted terracotta sculpture played a key role in the visual culture of archaic Etruria. Terracotta artwork was the standard for decorating the superstructure of Etruscan temples and the coroplastic (terracotta) workshops producing these sculptures often displayed a high level of technical achievement. This is due, in part, to the fact that ready sources of marble were unknown in archaic Italy. Even though contemporary Greeks produced masterworks in marble during the sixth century B.C.E., terracotta statuary such as this sarcophagus itself counts as a masterwork and would have been an elite commission. Contemporary Greek colonists in Italy also produced high level terracotta statuary, as exemplified by the seated statue of Zeus from Poseidonia (later renamed Paestum) that dates c. 530 B.C.E. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Forests of Stone</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Algeria is Africa&rsquo;s largest country and most of it falls within the Sahara Desert. It also hosts a rich rock art concentration. Most of the sites are found in the south east of the country near its borders with Libya and Niger but there are also important concentrations in the Algerian Maghreb and in the Hoggar Mountains in the central south.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most renowned of all these areas is the Tassili n&rsquo;Ajjer (meaning &quot;plateau of chasms&quot;) in the south east. Water and sand erosion have carved out a landscape of thin passageways, large arches, and high-pillared rocks, described as &ldquo;forests of stone&rdquo; by French archaeologist and ethnographer Henri Lhote. The resulting undercuts at cliff bases have created rock shelters with smooth walls ideal for painting and engraving (left).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Ajjer plateau rises to approximately 500-600 meters above the plain of Djanet, an oasis city, and capital of Djanet District, in Illizi Province, southeast Algeria. The region has been inhabited since Neolithic times, when the environment was much wetter and sustained a wider extent of flora and fauna as witnessed in the numerous rock paintings of Tassili n&#39;Ajjer. Classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982 and Biosphere Reserve in 1986, Tassili n&#39;Ajjer covers a vast area of desert landscape in southern Algeria, stretching from the Niger and Libyan border area, north and east of Djanet, as far as Illizi and Amguid, covering an area of 72,000 sq. km.</p>\n"

"<p>The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Subject matter</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More than 15,000 rock paintings and engravings, dating back as far as 12,000 years are located in this region and have made Tassili world famous for this reason. The art depicts herds of cattle and large wild animals such as giraffe and elephant, as well as human activities such as hunting and dancing. The area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings which were first described and published by Henri Lhote in the 1950s. Thought to date from around 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found on the African continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It seems strange now but for a while the art world turned its back on the German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Aside from being cursed with the label of Hitler&rsquo;s favourite artist, for much of the twentieth century the Impressionists, with their loose, painterly style, were held to be the fathers of modern art. Friedrich&rsquo;s work in comparison was considered too meticulous, too precise, too finely detailed to warrant serious critical attention.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Over the last few decades though the tide of opinion has turned. Now it is generally accepted that both in his technical brilliance and theoretically in his views of what the purpose of art should be, Friedrich was as radical as they come. But if proof were ever needed again of his credentials as one of the great forerunners of modern art, then <em>The Monk by the Sea </em>would have to be it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A new departure</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b6b8750b6d4f3e88d9971b7aadd4c1bd19a86836.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Friedrich, <em>Abbey Among Oak Trees,</em>&nbsp;1809 or 1810, oil on canvas, 110.4 x 171 cm&nbsp;(Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin)</span></span>Exhibited in the Academy in Berlin in 1810 along with its companion piece<em>&nbsp;Abbey Among Oak Trees</em>, it depicts a monk standing on the shore looking out to sea. The location has been identified as R&uuml;gen, an island off the north-east coast of Germany, a site he frequently painted.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monk is positioned a little over a third of the way into the painting from the left, to a ratio of around 1:1.6. The same ratio can be found frequently in Western art and is known variously as the golden ration, rule or section. Aside from this nod to tradition however there is little else about this painting that can be described as conventional.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The horizon line is unusually low and stretches uninterrupted from one end of the canvas to the other. The dark blue sea is flecked with white suggesting the threat of a storm. Above it in that turbulent middle section blue-grey clouds gather giving way in the highest part to a clearer, calmer blue. The transition from one to the other is achieved subtly through a technique called scumbling in which one colour is applied in thin layers on top of another to create an ill-defined, hazy effect.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The composition could not be further from typical German landscape paintings of the time. These generally followed the principles of a style imported from England known as the picturesque which tended to employ well-established perspectival techniques designed to draw the viewer into the picture; devices such as trees situated in the foreground or rivers winding their course, snake- like, into the distance. Friedrich however deliberately shunned such tricks. Such wilfully unconventional decisions in a painting of this size provoked consternation among contemporary viewers, as his friend Heinrich von Kleist famously wrote: &ldquo;Since it has, in its uniformity and boundlessness, no foreground but the frame, it is as if one&rsquo;s eyelids had been cut off.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The monk</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is some debate as to who that strange figure, curved like a question mark, actually is. Some think it Friedrich himself, others the poet and theological Gotthard Ludwig Kosegarten who served as a pastor on R&uuml;gen and was known to give sermons on the shore. Kosegarten&rsquo;s writings certainly influenced the painting. Von Kleist, for example, refers to its &ldquo;Kosegarten effect&rdquo;. &nbsp;According to this pastor-poet nature, like the Bible, is a book through which God reveals Himself. &nbsp;God reveals Himself. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/18bd270942bf569f68c1cd578ea17b7cfccf093c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Monk (detail), Caspar David Friedrich, <em>Monk by the Sea,</em> c. 1809&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Similarly, stripping it of any literal Christian symbolism, Friedrich instead concentrates on the power of the natural climate and so charges the landscape with a divine authority, one which seems to all but subsume the figure of the monk. With nothing but land, sea and sky to measure him by, his physical presence is rendered fragile and hauntingly ambiguous.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The R&uuml;ckenfigur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Originally the figure was looking to the right. &nbsp;His feet still point in that direction. Friedrich altered this at some point, having him look out to sea. The technique of positioning a figure with their back towards the viewer is often found in Friedrich&#39;s art<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c79f5199a147630f98e2371d411ac5fdbb38c10a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Caspar David Friedrich, <em>Wanderer above the Sea of Fog</em>, 1818, oil on canvas, 37.3&nbsp;&times; 29.4 inches/&nbsp;98.4 cm &times; 74.8 cm, (Kunsthalle Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany)</span></span>; the German word for it is the r&uuml;ckenfigur.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>Monk by the Sea</em>, the first instance of it in his work, is somewhat atypical in that the monk being so small and situated so low on the horizon does not &lsquo;oversee&rsquo; the landscape the way Friedrich&rsquo;s ruck&euml;nfiguren generally do.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The technique is much more complex and intellectually challenging than those found in the picturesque. Acting as a visual cue, the figure draws us into the painting, prompting us, challenging us even, to follow its example and simply look. And so we do. Yet its presence also obscures our line of vision and rather than enhancing the view in the end disrupts it. &nbsp;In this sense, the ruck&euml;nfigur while reminding us of the infinite beauty of the world also points to our inability to experience it fully, a contradiction that we often find expressed in German Romantic art and literature.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A political statement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s army was occupying Prussia when the painting was completed and art historians have naturally looked to read the painting and its companion, which depicts of a funeral procession in a ruined abbey, as a comment on the French occupation. It would have been dangerous to be openly critical of Napoleon&rsquo;s forces so the paintings&rsquo; political messages are subtly coded.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Both paintings were purchased by the young Crown Prince, Frederick William, whose mother, Queen Louise, had died a few months earlier at the age of 34. An extremely popular figure, she had pleaded with Napoleon after his victory to treat the Prussian people fairly. Her death surely would have been fresh in people&rsquo;s minds when they saw the paintings, a tragic loss which was very much associated with the country&rsquo;s own defeat by the French.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The presence of death is certainly felt in <em>The Monk by the Sea</em>, though in the monk&rsquo;s resolute figure we also find a source of spiritual strength, defiance even,&nbsp;standing, like that gothic abbey and those German oaks in its pendant, as much perhaps a symbol of the resolve of the nation against the foreign military rule, as&nbsp;of the individual faced with his mortality.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Romantic</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like Constable, Friedrich drew on the natural world around him, often returning to the same area again and again. Unlike the English painter&rsquo;s more scientific or naturalist approach, though, Friedrich condensed the image so as to communicate an exact emotion. As he put it, &ldquo;a painter should paint not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within himself.&rdquo; It is this inward reaching project, using colour and form to reveal emotional truths, that singles him out as one of the greatest and most innovative painters of his age: a true Romantic.</p>\n"

"<p>Both paintings were purchased by the young Crown Prince, Frederick William, whose mother, Queen Louise, had died a few months earlier at the age of 34. An extremely popular figure, she had pleaded with Napoleon after his victory to treat the Prussian people fairly. Her death surely would have been fresh in people&rsquo;s minds when they saw the paintings, a tragic loss which was very much associated with the country&rsquo;s own defeat by the French.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The presence of death is certainly felt in <em>The Monk by the Sea</em>, though in the monk&rsquo;s resolute figure we also find a source of spiritual strength, defiance even,&nbsp;standing, like that gothic abbey and those German oaks in its pendant, as much perhaps a symbol of the resolve of the nation against the foreign military rule, as&nbsp;of the individual faced with his mortality.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Romantic</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like Constable, Friedrich drew on the natural world around him, often returning to the same area again and again. Unlike the English painter&rsquo;s more scientific or naturalist approach, though, Friedrich condensed the image so as to communicate an exact emotion. As he put it, &ldquo;a painter should paint not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within himself.&rdquo; It is this inward reaching project, using colour and form to reveal emotional truths, that singles him out as one of the greatest and most innovative painters of his age: a true Romantic.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>About carpets</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are among the most fundamental of Islamic arts. Portable, typically made of silk and wools, carpets were traded and sold across the Islamic lands and beyond its boundaries to Europe and China. Those from Iran were highly prized. Carpets decorated the floors of mosques, shrines and homes, but they could also be hung on walls of houses to preserve warmth in the winter.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ardabil and a 14th century Saint</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The carpet takes its name from the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran. Ardabil was the home to the shrine of the Sufi saint, Safi al-Din Ardabili, who died in 1334 (Sufism is Islamic mysticism). He was a Sufi leader who trained his followers in Islamic mystic practices. After his death, his following grew and his descendents became increasingly powerful. In 1501 one of his descendents, Shah Isma&rsquo;il, seized power, united Iran, and established Shi&rsquo;a Islam as the official religion. The dynasty he founded is known as the Safavids. Their rule, which lasted until 1722, was one of the most important periods for Islamic art, especially for textiles and for manuscripts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Made for a shrine&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Plan of the shrine at Ardabil, showing where the carpets were situated (permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4e3d4042f01060ec790cbdbbaa10a10f195823a2.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plan of the shrine at Ardabil, showing where the carpets were situated (permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) </span></span>This carpet was one of a matching pair that was made for the shrine of Safi al-Din Ardabili when it was enlarged in the late 1530s. Today the Ardabil carpet dominates the main Islamic Art Gallery in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, while its twin is in the LA County Museum of Art. The carpets were located side by side in the shrine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The pile of the carpet is made from wool, rather than silk because it holds dye better. The knot-count of a carpet still directly impacts the value of carpets today; the more knots per square centimeter, the more detailed and elaborate the patterns can be. The dyes used to color the carpet are natural&nbsp;and include pomegrante rind and indigo. Up to ten weavers could have worked on the carpet at any given time. The Ardabil carpet has 340 knots per square inch (5300 knots per ten centimeters square). Today, a commercial rug averages 80-160 knots per square inch, meaning that the Ardabil carpet was highly detailed. Its high knot count allowed for the inclusion of an intricate design and pattern. It is not known whether the carpet was produced in a royal workshop, but there is evidence for court workshop in the 15th and 16th centuries. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet, detail\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2328b1ad3ad692f83b5061730c424ddb845b4ead.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Design and Pattern</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The rich geometric patterns, vegetative scrolls, floral flourishes, so typical of Islamic art, reach a fever pitch in this remarkable carpet, encouraging the viewer to walk around and around, trying to absorb every detail of design.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>That the design of the carpet was not arbitrary or piecemeal, but was well-organized and thoughtful can be seen throughout. Considering the immense size of the carpet&mdash;10.51m x 5.34m (34&#39; 6&quot; x 17&#39; 6&quot;)&mdash;this is impressive. A central golden medallion dominates the carpet; it is surrounded by a ring of multi-colored, detailed ovals. Lamps appear to hang at either end.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet (detail)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/349718038689c38ba56ad5b0ae36cc27f683e29d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The carpet&rsquo;s border is made up of a frame with a series of cartouches (rectangular-shaped spaces for calligraphy), filled with decoration. The central medallion design is also echoed by the four corner-pieces.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet (detail of lamp)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13f6ec12fc841d6f40461c05aad2f42286ad972b.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail of lamp)</span></span>Art historians have debated the meaning of the two lamps that appear to hang from the medallion. They are of different sizes and some scholars have proposed that this was done to create a perspective effect, meaning that both lamps appear to be the same size when one sat next to the smaller lamp. Yet, there is no evidence for the use of this type of perspective in Iran in the 1530s, nor does this explain why the lamps were included. Perhaps they were included to mimic lamps found in mosques and shrines, helping the viewer to look deeply into the carpet below them and then above them, to the ceiling where similar lamps would have hung, creating visual unity within the shrine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An inscription&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Ardabil Carpet includes a four-line inscription placed at one end. This short poem is vital for understanding who commissioned the carpet and the date of the carpet.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first three lines of poetry reads:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />\n"
"<span>Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.</span><br />\n"
"<span>The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</span></p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Maqsud was probably the court official charged with producing the carpets. By referring to himself as a slave, he may be presenting himself as a humble servant. The Persian word for a door can be used to denote a shrine or royal court, so this inscription may imply that the royal court patronized the shrine. The carpets would have probably taken four years to make.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The fourth line of the inscription is also important. It provides the date of the carpet, AH 946. The Muslim calendar begins in the year 620 CE when Muhammad fled from Mecca to Medina; this year is known as the year of the Hijra or flight (in Latin anno hegirae). AH 946 is equivalent to 1539/40 CE (the lunar Muslim calendar does not exactly match the Gregorian Calendar, used in the west).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of the Ardabil carpet and its skillful execution is a testament to the great skill of the artisans at work in north-west Iran in the 1530s.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet (detail)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b2279a5996831610b7551aac03c4c1eff80db394.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>How the Carpet Came to the V&amp;A</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many great treasures from around the world have legally made their way into the collections of western museums. Many objects were legally purchased by collectors and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries; however, many works of art are still illegally exported and sold. British visitors to the shrine in 1843, noted that at least one carpet was still in situ. Approximately thirty years or so later, an earthquake damaged the shrine, and the carpets were sold off.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ziegler &amp; Co., a Manchester firm involved in the carpet trade purchased the damaged carpets in Iran and &ldquo;restored&rdquo; them in fashion typical of the late nineteenth century. Selections of one carpet were used to repair the other, resulting in a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; carpet and one lacking a border. Vincent Robinson and Co, a dealer based in London, put the larger carpet up for sale in 1892 and persuaded the V&amp;A to purchase it for &pound;2000 in March 1893.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The second carpet was secretly sold to an American collector, J.P. Getty, who donated it to the LA County Museum of Art in 1953. Unlike the carpet in the V&amp;A, the carpet in LACMA is incomplete. Throughout the twentieth century, other pieces of the carpets have appeared on the art market for sale.</p>\n"

"<p>Rembrandt&rsquo;s <em>Night Watch</em> is an example of a very specific type of painting that was exclusive to the Northern Netherlands, with the majority&nbsp;being commissioned in the city of Amsterdam. &nbsp;It is a group portrait of a company of civic guardsmen. The primary purpose of these guardsmen was to serve as defenders of their cities. &nbsp;As such, they were tasked with guarding gates, policing streets, putting out fires, and generally maintaining order throughout the city. &nbsp;Additionally, they were an important presence at parades held for visiting royalty as well and other festive occasions. &nbsp;Each company had its own guild hall as well as a shooting range where they could practice with the specific weapon associated with their group, either a longbow, a crossbow, or a firearm. &nbsp;According to tradition, these assembly halls were decorated with group portraits of its most distinguished members, which served not only to record the likenesses of these citizens, but more importantly to assert the power and individuality of the city that they defended. &nbsp;In short, these images helped promote a sense of pride and civic duty.</p>\n"

"<p>Rembrandt was at the height of his career when he received the commission to paint the <em>Night Watch</em> for the <em>Kloveniersdoelen</em>, the guild hall that housed the Amsterdam civic guard company of arquebusiers, or musketeers. &nbsp;This company was under the command of Captain Frans Banning Cocq, who holds a prominent position in the center foreground of the image (above left).

"<p>Would it surprise you to find that the title that Rembrandt&rsquo;s most famous painting is known by is actually incorrect? &nbsp;The so-called <em>Night Watch</em> is not a night scene at all; it actually takes place during the day. &nbsp;This title, which was not given by the artist, was first applied at the end of the 18th century. &nbsp;By that time the painting had darkened considerably through the accumulation of many layers of dirt and varnish, giving the appearance that the event takes place at night. &nbsp;A more accurate title, one that is in keeping with the naming of other contemporary portraits of this type is the &ldquo;Officers and Men of the Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Wilhelm van Ruytenburgh.&rdquo;</p>\n"

"<h3>The Dutch Civic Guard&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rembrandt&rsquo;s <em>Night Watch</em> is an example of a very specific type of painting that was exclusive to the Northern Netherlands, with the majority&nbsp;being commissioned in the city of Amsterdam. &nbsp;It is a group portrait of a company of civic guardsmen. The primary purpose of these guardsmen was to serve as defenders of their cities. &nbsp;As such, they were tasked with guarding gates, policing streets, putting out fires, and generally maintaining order throughout the city. &nbsp;Additionally, they were an important presence at parades held for visiting royalty as well and other festive occasions. &nbsp;Each company had its own guild hall as well as a shooting range where they could practice with the specific weapon associated with their group, either a longbow, a crossbow, or a firearm. &nbsp;According to tradition, these assembly halls were decorated with group portraits of its most distinguished members, which served not only to record the likenesses of these citizens, but more importantly to assert the power and individuality of the city that they defended. &nbsp;In short, these images helped promote a sense of pride and civic duty.</p>\n"

"<p>Buddhism is a religion based on the teachings of a historical figure known as the&nbsp;Buddha Shakyamuni, who lived about 2,500 years ago. In some schools of Buddhism the Buddha Shakyamuni is thought of as one buddha among many, each inhabiting a different era or part of the universe. This sculpture shows Amitabha, identified as the Buddha of the Western Paradise. Amitabha is shown seated in deep concentration with half-closed eyes and hands held together at the lap in the gesture of meditation. He wears a simple monk&rsquo;s robe, draped over the shoulders, leaving the flesh of his chest and the lower part of one arm exposed. His hair arrangement, typical for Amitabha, is composed of hundreds of curls, and raised at the top in a cranial bulge that is one of the marks of the Buddha&rsquo;s supernatural powers.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, images of Amitabha were created in large numbers as a result of the popularity of a Buddhist sect known as Pure Land. The teachings of this sect emphasized the horrors of Buddhist hells and celebrated the glories of Amitabha&rsquo;s Western Paradise, also known as the&nbsp;Pure Land. Pure Land adherents believed that if they uttered Amitabha&rsquo;s name sincerely, they would achieve salvation, and be escorted to his glorious paradise after death by a retinue of gods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>How was this object made?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Amitabha is carved of wood and constructed using the &ldquo;joined-wood&rdquo; technique. In contrast to earlier wood sculpture carved from a single block, eleventh century sculptors developed this new technique to produce large, lightweight images. Artisans made images like this one by shaping and hollowing separate, smaller blocks of wood, then assembling the parts into one large sculpture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There were several advantages to this technique: the finished sculpture was less likely to split because the wood core had been removed; the use of small pieces of wood required only a third of the wood needed for single-block construction; and the work could be divided into specialized steps each done by different groups of workers, a process somewhat akin to a factory assembly line. After completion, the figure was coated with lacquer and then gilded.</p>\n"

"<p>During the&nbsp;Kamakura period&nbsp;(1185&ndash;1333), proselytizing, mendicant monks spread the teachings of Pure Land Buddhism throughout Japan. Along with many commoners, warriors turned to faith in Amitabha as an expedient means of ensuring salvation. Although large-scale images like this one would not have been available on the battlefield, prayer strips inscribed with the name of Amitabha were distributed as portable reminders of his power, allaying the fears of many soldiers in combat. Pure Land monks are known to have attended warriors on the battlefield, encouraging prayer and witnessing the proper conduct of their death.</p>\n"

"<p>Southwell Minster in Nottinghamshire, England, is not as famous as some of Britain&rsquo;s other great medieval churches, and neither is it as large. However, it presents superb examples of both Romanesque or Norman and Gothic architecture in a building that suffered little damage during the turbulent years of the British Reformation, Civil War, and World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Construction of the current church building was begun circa 1108, and was essentially completed around 50 years later. The basic layout for churches at that time was the shape of a cross, with the east end as the top, the transepts making the crossing arm, and the nave as the longer extension at the bottom of the cross. The east end held the altar and choir, or quire, which were used by the clergy during daily masses. The nave was accessible to the lay community. Although medieval British churches are basically oriented east to west, they all vary slightly. When a new church was to be built, the patron saint was selected and the altar location laid out. On the saint&rsquo;s day, a line would be surveyed from the position of the rising sun through the altar site and extending in a westerly direction. This was the orientation of the new building.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Southwell Minster in Nottinghamshire, England, is not as famous as some of Britain&rsquo;s other great medieval churches, and neither is it as large. However, it presents superb examples of both Romanesque or Norman and Gothic architecture in a building that suffered little damage during the turbulent years of the British Reformation, Civil War, and World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Construction of the current church building was begun circa 1108, and was essentially completed around 50 years later. The basic layout for churches at that time was the shape of a cross, with the east end as the top, the transepts making the crossing arm, and the nave as the longer extension at the bottom of the cross. The east end held the altar and choir, or quire, which were used by the clergy during daily masses. The nave was accessible to the lay community. Although medieval British churches are basically oriented east to west, they all vary slightly. When a new church was to be built, the patron saint was selected and the altar location laid out. On the saint&rsquo;s day, a line would be surveyed from the position of the rising sun through the altar site and extending in a westerly direction. This was the orientation of the new building.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3><em>Posas</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Among the church&#39;s&nbsp;most important architectural features are a group of four open-air chapels&nbsp;known as&nbsp;<em>posas</em>&nbsp;located in each of the corners of the monastery&rsquo;s atrium. They are among the best preserved in all of Mexico and exemplify the practice of outdoor spiritual teaching that was so much a part of the process of colonization. In the Franciscan mission at Huejotzingo, a new visual language representing spiritual conversion is evident when the visitor crosses the threshold of the <em>posas.</em></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"North West Posa, mid to late 16th century, Huejotzingo, Puebla, Mexico (photo: Alejandro Linares Garcia CC BY-SA 3.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/aed388deaa1f91a636cf82ed310b8f9be98f8c2d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">North West Posa, mid to late 16th century, Huejotzingo, Puebla, Mexico (photo: <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NWSantiagoChapelHuejotzingo.JPG\">Alejandro Linares Garcia</a>, CC BY-SA 3.0)</span></span>The&nbsp;posas&nbsp;are vaulted in the interior, capped by a pyramid-like structure, and adorned with crosses on their pinnacles. The structures are accessible through arches on two adjacent sides to allow processions&nbsp;to move through unimpeded. Each posa measures seventeen feet across and are twice as high. They are constructed of stone, like the rest of Huejotzingo. However, their historical significance is principally the result of&nbsp;how Mesoamerican religious practices were implemented here for the purpose of mass spiritual conquest.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The position of the chapels in the atrium&rsquo;s corners allowed for a large number of people to participate in dramatic&nbsp;daily liturgical processions. The interiors of the <em>posas </em>were decorated with frescoes that included themes of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary and the Last Judgment. These images would have intensified the emotional effects of spiritual salvation and condemnation for recent indigenous converts. <em>Posas</em> were most likely adaptations of <em>tremezzi</em>, which date back to fourteenth-century Italian religious architecture. A tremezzo was a bridge and porch-like form that spanned across a church nave. Its purpose was to shelter altars, and was used as a stage for preaching and dramatic enactments. In addition to any possible&nbsp;European architectural forerunners, one must also consider Mesoamerican precedents. For instance, <em>posas</em> resemble <em>callis</em> (&quot;house&quot; in Nahuatl, an indigenous language of Central Mexico), which were rectangular and open on one side, and Aztec temple houses, which were erected atop pyramids (<em>teocalli</em>).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><em>Posas</em> allowed for conversion to take place outside the main church. While this may have been done for practical purposes, pre-Columbian Mexican&nbsp;spiritual ceremonies also took place out of doors. Worshippers were accustomed to gathering in open courtyards to listen to priest-rulers. Another example of the fusion of Christian and indigenous spiritual meaning is presented by the pyramidal shape of the chapels&rsquo; roofs, which were surmounted by highly ornate crosses. Crosses were important symbols for water, fertility, and sustenance prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. Non-Christian, pre-Columbian crosses were often created out of trees and represented the Tree of Life in various rituals. In mission spaces such as Huejotzingo, crosses became a powerful symbol for the source of spiritual life shared by Europeans and indigenous peoples alike. They were placed in the center of monastery atriums as a symbol of the Christian and indigenous <em>axis mundis </em>(world axis). The crosses that topped the posas, of which only the example from below survives, were modeled with similar didactic functions as the large atrium crosses that decorated most sixteenth-century missions in this region. They were carved with a fusion of Mesoamerican and European symbols, offering natives an opportunity to learn about Christ&rsquo;s life, death, and resurrection through familiar regional motifs.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The stigmata were not only representations of Christ&rsquo;s Passion, but in this context, also the miraculous stigmatization of St. Francis, the patron saint of the Franciscan order. Above the open sides of the posas, which are framed by a relief of the order&rsquo;s knotted rope cord, appear four Franciscan Order shields, containing five grape clusters, reiterating the stigmata iconography (wine from grapes&nbsp;miraculously becomes the blood of Christ during the Eucharist).</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Posa </em>fa&ccedil;ade iconography</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On every arch, two apocalyptic angels hover within an <em>alfiz</em>. This is a term borrowed from Mozarabic architecture and it is used to describe the relief details that surround the perimeters of an arch. In Huejotzingo&rsquo;s <em>posas</em>, the <em>alfiz</em> is carved to resemble a knotted Franciscan cord. Each angel holds a different Instrument of the Passion (or the <em>Arma Christi</em>), announcing the sacred battle against pagan forces. Above the keystone, we see an emblem of the Virgin Mary capped by a crowned cross. The posa carvings&nbsp;communicate the unifying suffering of Saint Francis and Christ.</p>\n"

"<p>In 1994, UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) named the earliest sixteenth-century Mexican monasteries found on the slopes of the Popocatepetl volcano in central Mexico a World Heritage Site. These fourteen monasteries define&nbsp;the history of Christian evangelization for much of Mexico&rsquo;s colonial period (1521&ndash;1821). One of these monasteries is the Franciscan mission of St. Michael the Archangel in Huejotzingo, twenty-three miles outside the city of Puebla.</p>\n"

It displays aspects of Mannerism, a&nbsp;style&nbsp;that&nbsp;remained influential in colonial M&eacute;xico for almost a hundred years. </span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Posas</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Among the church&#39;s&nbsp;most important architectural features are a group of four open-air chapels&nbsp;known as&nbsp;<em>posas</em>&nbsp;located in each of the corners of the monastery&rsquo;s atrium. They are among the best preserved in all of Mexico and exemplify the practice of outdoor spiritual teaching that was so much a part of the process of colonization. In the Franciscan mission at Huejotzingo, a new visual language representing spiritual conversion is evident when the visitor crosses the threshold of the <em>posas.</em></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"North West Posa, mid to late 16th century, Huejotzingo, Puebla, Mexico (photo: Alejandro Linares Garcia CC BY-SA 3.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/aed388deaa1f91a636cf82ed310b8f9be98f8c2d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">North West Posa, mid to late 16th century, Huejotzingo, Puebla, Mexico (photo: <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NWSantiagoChapelHuejotzingo.JPG\">Alejandro Linares Garcia</a>, CC BY-SA 3.0)</span></span>The&nbsp;posas&nbsp;are vaulted in the interior, capped by a pyramid-like structure, and adorned with crosses on their pinnacles. The structures are accessible through arches on two adjacent sides to allow processions&nbsp;to move through unimpeded. Each posa measures seventeen feet across and are twice as high. They are constructed of stone, like the rest of Huejotzingo. However, their historical significance is principally the result of&nbsp;how Mesoamerican religious practices were implemented here for the purpose of mass spiritual conquest.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The position of the chapels in the atrium&rsquo;s corners allowed for a large number of people to participate in dramatic&nbsp;daily liturgical processions. The interiors of the <em>posas </em>were decorated with frescoes that included themes of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary and the Last Judgment. These images would have intensified the emotional effects of spiritual salvation and condemnation for recent indigenous converts. <em>Posas</em> were most likely adaptations of <em>tremezzi</em>, which date back to fourteenth-century Italian religious architecture. A tremezzo was a bridge and porch-like form that spanned across a church nave. Its purpose was to shelter altars, and was used as a stage for preaching and dramatic enactments. In addition to any possible&nbsp;European architectural forerunners, one must also consider Mesoamerican precedents. For instance, <em>posas</em> resemble <em>callis</em> (&quot;house&quot; in Nahuatl, an indigenous language of Central Mexico), which were rectangular and open on one side, and Aztec temple houses, which were erected atop pyramids (<em>teocalli</em>).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><em>Posas</em> allowed for conversion to take place outside the main church. While this may have been done for practical purposes, pre-Columbian Mexican&nbsp;spiritual ceremonies also took place out of doors. Worshippers were accustomed to gathering in open courtyards to listen to priest-rulers. Another example of the fusion of Christian and indigenous spiritual meaning is presented by the pyramidal shape of the chapels&rsquo; roofs, which were surmounted by highly ornate crosses. Crosses were important symbols for water, fertility, and sustenance prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. Non-Christian, pre-Columbian crosses were often created out of trees and represented the Tree of Life in various rituals. In mission spaces such as Huejotzingo, crosses became a powerful symbol for the source of spiritual life shared by Europeans and indigenous peoples alike. They were placed in the center of monastery atriums as a symbol of the Christian and indigenous <em>axis mundis </em>(world axis). The crosses that topped the posas, of which only the example from below survives, were modeled with similar didactic functions as the large atrium crosses that decorated most sixteenth-century missions in this region. They were carved with a fusion of Mesoamerican and European symbols, offering natives an opportunity to learn about Christ&rsquo;s life, death, and resurrection through familiar regional motifs.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The stigmata were not only representations of Christ&rsquo;s Passion, but in this context, also the miraculous stigmatization of St. Francis, the patron saint of the Franciscan order. Above the open sides of the posas, which are framed by a relief of the order&rsquo;s knotted rope cord, appear four Franciscan Order shields, containing five grape clusters, reiterating the stigmata iconography (wine from grapes&nbsp;miraculously becomes the blood of Christ during the Eucharist).</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>On every arch, two apocalyptic angels hover within an <em>alfiz</em>. This is a term borrowed from Mozarabic architecture and it is used to describe the relief details that surround the perimeters of an arch. In Huejotzingo&rsquo;s <em>posas</em>, the <em>alfiz</em> is carved to resemble a knotted Franciscan cord. Each angel holds a different Instrument of the Passion (or the <em>Arma Christi</em>), announcing the sacred battle against pagan forces. Above the keystone, we see an emblem of the Virgin Mary capped by a crowned cross. The posa carvings&nbsp;communicate the unifying suffering of Saint Francis and Christ.</p>\n"

"<p>And the winner of &ldquo;Miss Arte Italiana&rdquo; is&mdash;drum roll please&mdash;Antonio Canova&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious</em>! Or so, at least, is what a recent poll&nbsp;carried&nbsp;out for the Marilena Ferrari Foundation decided.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5a0b74d6d1d72a6d06aa4d30ac72b6f4fa695a4f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Antonio Canova, <em>Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious</em>, 1804-08, white marble, 160 x 192 cm (Galleria Borghese, Rome)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;Miss Italian Art,&rdquo;&nbsp;a cringeworthy epithet perhaps, but one which, given the&nbsp;strength of the competition, is nothing to sneeze at&mdash;works by Botticelli,&nbsp;Leonardo and Titian were also in contention.&nbsp;Certainly, the semi-nude, life-size portrait of Napoleon&rsquo;s wayward sister is a&nbsp;sumptuous work of art. Four years in the making, it was commissioned by&nbsp;Paolina&rsquo;s second husband, the Italian prince, Camillo Borghese, shortly after&nbsp;their marriage in 1804, a union designed to help Napoleon realise his dreams of&nbsp;establishing a pan-European dynasty and legitimize his claims to the Kingdom of&nbsp;Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Canova and Neoclassicism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anotonio Canova was a leading light of the Neoclassical movement. The style,&nbsp;influenced by the archeological discoveries in Pompeii and Herculaneum as&nbsp;well as the theories of the art historian Johann Wincklemann, looked back to the&nbsp;artistic achievements of the Greeks and Romans with renewed interest, informed&nbsp;by the spirit of rational enquiry that characterized the Age of Enlightenment.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As Inspector General of Antiquities and Fine Art of the Papal States and&nbsp;responsible for acquiring works for the Vatican museums, Canova would have&nbsp;known his Phidias from his Praxiteles. However, he was no slavish imitator.&nbsp;Instead he wished to emulate the works of these earlier artists.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fae8d4becdcb71c46cc56998815b5317ca44f65a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Nineteenth century French engraving of Canova, N<em>apoleon as Mars the Peacemaker</em>, 1802-1806, 325 cm&nbsp;(Wellington Museum, Apsley House, London)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The methods he used demanded absolute precision. Working from numerous&nbsp;preparatory sketches he modelled the form into a life-size clay version. He&nbsp;then cast a plaster model of this which he marked up with points that were&nbsp;transferred on to the marble block. His assistants would carve the marble into&nbsp;shape and only then, for &ldquo;the last hand,&rdquo;&nbsp;did Canova raise his chisel, sculpting the&nbsp;form and crucially polishing the marble, using wax, to a fine, glistening finish.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of his models were great personalities of the age. Canova would portray&nbsp;them in antique costume. This classicizing of contemporary figures verged&nbsp;sometimes on the ridiculous, as in the colossal nude sculpture of&nbsp;<em>Napoleon as&nbsp;Mars the Peacemaker.</em>&nbsp;His portrait of Paolina Borghese is more successful.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A modern day Venus</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Paolina is shown reclining on a pillowed couch in a pose of studied grace, both&nbsp;concentrated and relaxed. The modelling of the nude body is extraordinarily&nbsp;lifelike, while Canova&rsquo;s treatment of the surface of the marble captures the soft&nbsp;texture of skin. The tactile quality of the piece is bought out particularly in the&nbsp;way the sitter&rsquo;s own hands are occupied, the fingers of her right connecting&nbsp;ever so lightly with the nape of her neck, offer a gesture charged with seductive&nbsp;promise. The head is raised slightly suggesting that something or someone has&nbsp;suddenly entered her line of vision. The apple she holds in her left hand, her&nbsp;fingers wrapped around it suggestive of erotic touch, identifies her as Venus&nbsp;Victorious, the goddess awarded the Golden Apple of Discord in perhaps the&nbsp;first beauty competition in the history of Western culture. The story comes from&nbsp;ancient Greece. Paris the Trojan prince judged Venus more beautiful than either&nbsp;of her rivals, Minerva and Juno. In return Venus introduced him to a Greek girl&nbsp;called Helen and the rest of course is the stuff of epic poetry.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Originally, Canova was to depict her as Diana, the chaste goddess of the moon&nbsp;and the hunt, a role that more would have require her to have been clothed.&nbsp;Paolina insisted on Venus, though. A bit of a loose cannon with a reputation&nbsp;for promiscuity, the Emperor&rsquo;s sister enjoyed courting controversy and posing&nbsp;naked would certainly have raised a few eyebrows in polite society. But there&nbsp;was more to it than that. Apparently, the Borghese family believed themselves&nbsp;to be descended from the heroic founder of Rome, Aeneas, who according to&nbsp;Virgil was the son of Venus. The choice then not only suited Paolina&#39;s flirtatious&nbsp;character, but also would have been met with approval by the Borghese family,&nbsp;suggesting continuity between the ancient and modern worlds.&nbsp;Her&nbsp;hair, a mass of curls bound in a Psyche knot, serves as a visual connector&nbsp;between the two, being worn in imitation of ancient Greek styles as was the&nbsp;fashion of the day. Its careful articulation offsets the smooth shallow planes of&nbsp;her torso.</p>\n"

"<p>And the winner of &ldquo;Miss Arte Italiana&rdquo; is&mdash;drum roll please&mdash;Antonio Canova&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious</em>! Or so, at least, is what a recent poll&nbsp;carried&nbsp;out for the Marilena Ferrari Foundation decided.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5a0b74d6d1d72a6d06aa4d30ac72b6f4fa695a4f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Antonio Canova, <em>Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious</em>, 1804-08, white marble, 160 x 192 cm (Galleria Borghese, Rome)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;Miss Italian Art,&rdquo;&nbsp;a cringeworthy epithet perhaps, but one which, given the&nbsp;strength of the competition, is nothing to sneeze at&mdash;works by Botticelli,&nbsp;Leonardo and Titian were also in contention.&nbsp;Certainly, the semi-nude, life-size portrait of Napoleon&rsquo;s wayward sister is a&nbsp;sumptuous work of art. Four years in the making, it was commissioned by&nbsp;Paolina&rsquo;s second husband, the Italian prince, Camillo Borghese, shortly after&nbsp;their marriage in 1804, a union designed to help Napoleon realise his dreams of&nbsp;establishing a pan-European dynasty and legitimize his claims to the Kingdom of&nbsp;Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Canova and Neoclassicism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anotonio Canova was a leading light of the Neoclassical movement. The style,&nbsp;influenced by the archeological discoveries in Pompeii and Herculaneum as&nbsp;well as the theories of the art historian Johann Wincklemann, looked back to the&nbsp;artistic achievements of the Greeks and Romans with renewed interest, informed&nbsp;by the spirit of rational enquiry that characterized the Age of Enlightenment.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As Inspector General of Antiquities and Fine Art of the Papal States and&nbsp;responsible for acquiring works for the Vatican museums, Canova would have&nbsp;known his Phidias from his Praxiteles. However, he was no slavish imitator.&nbsp;Instead he wished to emulate the works of these earlier artists.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fae8d4becdcb71c46cc56998815b5317ca44f65a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Nineteenth century French engraving of Canova, N<em>apoleon as Mars the Peacemaker</em>, 1802-1806, 325 cm&nbsp;(Wellington Museum, Apsley House, London)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The methods he used demanded absolute precision. Working from numerous&nbsp;preparatory sketches he modelled the form into a life-size clay version. He&nbsp;then cast a plaster model of this which he marked up with points that were&nbsp;transferred on to the marble block. His assistants would carve the marble into&nbsp;shape and only then, for &ldquo;the last hand,&rdquo;&nbsp;did Canova raise his chisel, sculpting the&nbsp;form and crucially polishing the marble, using wax, to a fine, glistening finish.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of his models were great personalities of the age. Canova would portray&nbsp;them in antique costume. This classicizing of contemporary figures verged&nbsp;sometimes on the ridiculous, as in the colossal nude sculpture of&nbsp;<em>Napoleon as&nbsp;Mars the Peacemaker.</em>&nbsp;His portrait of Paolina Borghese is more successful.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A modern day Venus</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Paolina is shown reclining on a pillowed couch in a pose of studied grace, both&nbsp;concentrated and relaxed. The modelling of the nude body is extraordinarily&nbsp;lifelike, while Canova&rsquo;s treatment of the surface of the marble captures the soft&nbsp;texture of skin. The tactile quality of the piece is bought out particularly in the&nbsp;way the sitter&rsquo;s own hands are occupied, the fingers of her right connecting&nbsp;ever so lightly with the nape of her neck, offer a gesture charged with seductive&nbsp;promise. The head is raised slightly suggesting that something or someone has&nbsp;suddenly entered her line of vision. The apple she holds in her left hand, her&nbsp;fingers wrapped around it suggestive of erotic touch, identifies her as Venus&nbsp;Victorious, the goddess awarded the Golden Apple of Discord in perhaps the&nbsp;first beauty competition in the history of Western culture. The story comes from&nbsp;ancient Greece. Paris the Trojan prince judged Venus more beautiful than either&nbsp;of her rivals, Minerva and Juno. In return Venus introduced him to a Greek girl&nbsp;called Helen and the rest of course is the stuff of epic poetry.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/49cff0573a8ea4fb6b0e97635d9e0065f5707419.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Antonio Canova, detail <em>Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious</em>, 1804-08, white marble, 160 x 192 cm (Galleria Borghese, Rome)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Originally, Canova was to depict her as Diana, the chaste goddess of the moon&nbsp;and the hunt, a role that more would have require her to have been clothed.&nbsp;Paolina insisted on Venus, though. A bit of a loose cannon with a reputation&nbsp;for promiscuity, the Emperor&rsquo;s sister enjoyed courting controversy and posing&nbsp;naked would certainly have raised a few eyebrows in polite society. But there&nbsp;was more to it than that. Apparently, the Borghese family believed themselves&nbsp;to be descended from the heroic founder of Rome, Aeneas, who according to&nbsp;Virgil was the son of Venus. The choice then not only suited Paolina&#39;s flirtatious&nbsp;character, but also would have been met with approval by the Borghese family,&nbsp;suggesting continuity between the ancient and modern worlds.&nbsp;Her&nbsp;hair, a mass of curls bound in a Psyche knot, serves as a visual connector&nbsp;between the two, being worn in imitation of ancient Greek styles as was the&nbsp;fashion of the day. Its careful articulation offsets the smooth shallow planes of&nbsp;her torso.</p>\n"

"<p>Creating a contrast of another sort, the couch Paolina lies on is carved from&nbsp;a different type of marble, the base part of which is covered in rhythmically&nbsp;flowing drapery, much like on a catafalque, a raised platform used to bear coffins.&nbsp;The allusion to mortuary art is not that surprising; in Greek and Roman art the&nbsp;reclining female figure is frequently found on sarcophagus lids.

"<h3>A natural oasis</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The site of Jericho, just north of the Dead Sea and due west of the Jordan River, is one of the oldest continuously lived-in cities in the world. The reason for this may be found in its Arabic name, Ārīḥā, which means fragrant; Jericho is a natural oasis in the desert where countless fresh water springs can be found. This resource, which drew its first visitors between 10,000 and 9000 B.C.E., still has ancestors that live there today.</p>\n"

Like the Medici, they employed this kind of sacred patronage to expiate themselves against charges of immoral luxuriousness and wealth, as well as to quell suspicions of usury (charging interest, which was considered a sin). &nbsp;The irony, of course, is that a fresco insurance policy as grand as this one was only obtained at great cost, and was intended to attract maximum public attention. The extravagant &quot;humility&quot;&nbsp;of&nbsp;rich patrons (the Medici, the Tornabuoni and others), adorning the city with thinly-veiled monuments to themselves, came to be considered a demonstration of virtuous public service, celebrated as civic <em>magnificenza</em>.&nbsp; I suppose Donald Trump may see&nbsp;himself in the much the same way, scattering his showy, shiny monuments across&nbsp;America.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Bible in Florence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ghirlandaio loved Florence and fresco, and he adored the world and all of its charms. &nbsp; In contrast to the solid, stoic and severe formal classicism of the earlier generation of Alberti, Brunelleschi and Masaccio, Ghirlandaio loved form, color, variety, narrative and the quotidian (everyday)&nbsp;details of Florentine daily life. Although the primary narratives depicted in the Tornabuoni Chapel are scenes from the Life of John the Baptist and from the Life of the Virgin, these biblical scenes unfold in the streets of Florence, often staged in what appear to be temporary stage-sets, theatrical triumphal arches and temples, strewn with various bits of ancient Roman bric-a-brac, hastily assembled for the biblical actors. When you peer through the arches of these Lego-land wonders, you see the solid, sturdy, stone medieval fa&ccedil;ades of Florence&mdash;no matter where he goes in his imagination, for Ghirlandaio, Florence is the whole world. The conflation of time past and time present in the frescoes is also underscored by the inclusion, in many scenes, of late-fifteenth century members of the Tornabuoni family in the biblical subjects, floating across the stage like ghostly apparitions. For over 500 years these vivid frescoes have played across the walls of the chapel like a continuously looping documentary film, chronicling the living history of Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The painter &nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Domenico Ghirlandaio&nbsp;is often given rather short shrift by art historians existing, as he did, suspended between the austere Albertian mathematical rationalism of the fifteenth century and the agonized, self-flagellant extravagances of Michelangelo, to whom he served as painting master before he took up residence in the Medici garden. Trained in the family workshop, Ghirlandaio was an acknowledged fresco expert, and while his style is sometimes dismissed as &quot;prosaic,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it happily idiomatic, clearly revelling in the quotidian joys of observing the world around him&mdash;which is not to say that he lacked imagination. He had a distinct penchant for embellishing severe classical architectural settings with fanciful, fluid and flirtatious decorative flourishes and then peopling them with the most extraordinarily vivid and lively figures. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Every picture tells a story: the narratives</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The overall narrative program of the chapel is relatively simple, covering the two lateral walls, and part of the rear wall (around and above the magnificent stained-glass windows) in superimposed registers, &nbsp;culminating in frescoes of the Four Evangelists on the ceiling. &nbsp;</p>\n"

The message is clear&mdash;three mothers, two sons, two dispensations. John&rsquo;s fate, as the last Prophet of the Old Testament and first Apostle of the New Testament, is to recognize Jesus&nbsp;as the Messiah&mdash;this translation from old to new is the lynchpin that holds the cycles together.</p>\n"

The frescoes are, therefore, touching commemorative tributes to Giovanna, mingling the joys of birth with the sadness of death and the hope for eternal salvation.</p>\n"

"<h3>The life of the Virgin</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the many lovely aspects of the life of the Virgin, the loveliest is the story of her conception, born of a kiss between the aged Joachim and the long-barren Saint Ann, as they linger by the city gate. Ghirlandaio places this close encounter of the Biblical kind at the top of a staircase inside what appears to be a contemporary Florentine palace, where it gives way seamlessly to the contiguous <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>, easily the best-known scene from the chapel. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>St Ann props herself up in her fifteenth-century platform bed, in a luxuriously panelled room topped by a continuous frieze of illusionistically &quot;carved&quot;&nbsp;chubby, churning dancing putti. Midwives in the foreground pour water from an elegant pewter jug into a pewter basic, preparing baby&rsquo;s bath. The baby is a wriggling delight, held by a midwife and facing toward the still-floating Giovanna Tornabuoni, accompanied by her usual female entourage, all sumptuously dressed in high fifteenth-century Florentine style. Their presence is a reminder of the customary visits made by women of aristocratic families on the occasion of a birth. &nbsp;</p>\n"

But even here, in a scene of violent infanticide, Ghirlandaio can&rsquo;t shed his delight in fluttering, colourful sinuous draperies and an over-abundance of happy detail, which tends to highlight the ghoulishness of the dismembered baby parts strewn across the foreground, as though the putti of the Virgin&rsquo;s chamber (see the <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>&nbsp;above) had crumbled from the walls.</p>\n"

"<h3>The life of Saint&nbsp;John the Baptist</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are a number of frescoes depicting standard scenes associated with the life of the Baptist&mdash;chiefly his wanderings in the desert, during which he realizes his avocation, and his subsequent Baptism of Christ. &nbsp;But people sometimes forget that John, like Christ, was the result of a miraculous pregnancy. His parents, Zachariah and Elizabeth, had no children, but God heard&nbsp;Zachariah&rsquo;s prayers and the elderly Elizabeth found herself pregnant, three months in advance of the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary (the moment when Mary conceives Christ).&nbsp;The cycle therefore features the lovely moment of the <em>Visitation</em>, when Elizabeth and Mary encounter each other while pregnant and the unborn John &ldquo;leaps up&rdquo; in his mother&rsquo;s womb in recognition of the presence of Christ (Luke 1: 39-45). &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, The Visitation, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\n"

"<p>In his typical fashion, Ghirlandaio sets this encounter in a hybrid city setting; the women stand just inside a medieval wall and the Virgin faces toward the gliding and omniscient presence of Giovanna Tornabuoni.</p>\n"

In this confrontation of architectural styles, medieval and Renaissance, the old medieval world is giving way to the newly reborn &quot;Roman&quot;&nbsp;present, a trope Ghirlandaio borrowed from contemporary Netherlandish art. St. John the&nbsp;Baptist has his own lovingly detailed birth scene, complete with a rushing female figure carrying a birth tray of fresh fruits and replenishing foods to the new mother, the ever-watchful Giovanna Tornabuoni in the foreground.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Among the other scenes here, the one in which <em>Zaccariah Writes the Name of John</em> is the most unusual. &nbsp;At the moment of the angel Gabriel&rsquo;s announcement of Elizabeth&rsquo;s pregnancy, Zaccariah asked for a sign as proof; &nbsp;because he had spoken doubtfully, he lost the power of speech, regaining it only after writing on a tablet, at Elizabeth&rsquo;s urging, &quot;His name is John&quot;&nbsp;(Luke 1:18-22). The emphasis in this scene on written evidence is, perhaps, an allusion to the world of documents and contracts that characterized the Tornabuoni banking world.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The cycle on this wall culminates in a <em>Coronation of the Virgin with Saints</em>.</p>\n"

"<p>The Church of Santa Maria Novella, adjacent to the&nbsp;train station of the same name, is a treasure-house of Florentine art of the Renaissance. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>A banker&#39;s commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, Portrait of the Donor Francesca Pitti-Tornabuoni, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a5c741e4ff678d59384e3fa2a54ea3a84819b877.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>Portrait of the Donor Francesca Pitti-Tornabuoni</em>, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span>At the time of this commission, the Tornabuoni were the chief Florentine banking rivals of the Medici. Like the Medici, they employed this kind of sacred patronage to expiate themselves against charges of immoral luxuriousness and wealth, as well as to quell suspicions of usury (charging interest, which was considered a sin). &nbsp;The irony, of course, is that a fresco insurance policy as grand as this one was only obtained at great cost, and was intended to attract maximum public attention. The extravagant &quot;humility&quot;&nbsp;of&nbsp;rich patrons (the Medici, the Tornabuoni and others), adorning the city with thinly-veiled monuments to themselves, came to be considered a demonstration of virtuous public service, celebrated as civic <em>magnificenza</em>.&nbsp; I suppose Donald Trump may see&nbsp;himself in the much the same way, scattering his showy, shiny monuments across&nbsp;America.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Bible in Florence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ghirlandaio loved Florence and fresco, and he adored the world and all of its charms. &nbsp; In contrast to the solid, stoic and severe formal classicism of the earlier generation of Alberti, Brunelleschi and Masaccio, Ghirlandaio loved form, color, variety, narrative and the quotidian (everyday)&nbsp;details of Florentine daily life. Although the primary narratives depicted in the Tornabuoni Chapel are scenes from the Life of John the Baptist and from the Life of the Virgin, these biblical scenes unfold in the streets of Florence, often staged in what appear to be temporary stage-sets, theatrical triumphal arches and temples, strewn with various bits of ancient Roman bric-a-brac, hastily assembled for the biblical actors. When you peer through the arches of these Lego-land wonders, you see the solid, sturdy, stone medieval fa&ccedil;ades of Florence&mdash;no matter where he goes in his imagination, for Ghirlandaio, Florence is the whole world. The conflation of time past and time present in the frescoes is also underscored by the inclusion, in many scenes, of late-fifteenth century members of the Tornabuoni family in the biblical subjects, floating across the stage like ghostly apparitions. For over 500 years these vivid frescoes have played across the walls of the chapel like a continuously looping documentary film, chronicling the living history of Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The painter &nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Domenico Ghirlandaio&nbsp;is often given rather short shrift by art historians existing, as he did, suspended between the austere Albertian mathematical rationalism of the fifteenth century and the agonized, self-flagellant extravagances of Michelangelo, to whom he served as painting master before he took up residence in the Medici garden. Trained in the family workshop, Ghirlandaio was an acknowledged fresco expert, and while his style is sometimes dismissed as &quot;prosaic,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it happily idiomatic, clearly revelling in the quotidian joys of observing the world around him&mdash;which is not to say that he lacked imagination. He had a distinct penchant for embellishing severe classical architectural settings with fanciful, fluid and flirtatious decorative flourishes and then peopling them with the most extraordinarily vivid and lively figures. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Every picture tells a story: the narratives</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The overall narrative program of the chapel is relatively simple, covering the two lateral walls, and part of the rear wall (around and above the magnificent stained-glass windows) in superimposed registers, &nbsp;culminating in frescoes of the Four Evangelists on the ceiling. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/11a78ff5ac61161f2b665c533e7c19b90eb96e36.gif\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Tornabuoni Chapel, in green: stories of the Virgin Mary; in red: stories of St. John of the Baptist; and in violet: episodes of the Lives of Dominican Saints and the two patrons.

The message is clear&mdash;three mothers, two sons, two dispensations. John&rsquo;s fate, as the last Prophet of the Old Testament and first Apostle of the New Testament, is to recognize Jesus&nbsp;as the Messiah&mdash;this translation from old to new is the lynchpin that holds the cycles together.</p>\n"

The frescoes are, therefore, touching commemorative tributes to Giovanna, mingling the joys of birth with the sadness of death and the hope for eternal salvation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The life of the Virgin</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the many lovely aspects of the life of the Virgin, the loveliest is the story of her conception, born of a kiss between the aged Joachim and the long-barren Saint Ann, as they linger by the city gate. Ghirlandaio places this close encounter of the Biblical kind at the top of a staircase inside what appears to be a contemporary Florentine palace, where it gives way seamlessly to the contiguous <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>, easily the best-known scene from the chapel. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>St Ann props herself up in her fifteenth-century platform bed, in a luxuriously panelled room topped by a continuous frieze of illusionistically &quot;carved&quot;&nbsp;chubby, churning dancing putti. Midwives in the foreground pour water from an elegant pewter jug into a pewter basic, preparing baby&rsquo;s bath. The baby is a wriggling delight, held by a midwife and facing toward the still-floating Giovanna Tornabuoni, accompanied by her usual female entourage, all sumptuously dressed in high fifteenth-century Florentine style. Their presence is a reminder of the customary visits made by women of aristocratic families on the occasion of a birth. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46710ba01378e1f311428c487b8e69d541cbe707.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Left to right: Giovanna Tornabuoni, midwives with baby, St Ann (detail),&nbsp;Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>, fresco, 24 feet 4 inches x 14 feet 9 inches, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We next proceed through the <em>Presentation of the Virgin</em>, fluttering up the stairs to the high priest, her marriage to Joseph, the <em>Nativity</em> and, on a different note,&nbsp;the <em>Massacre of the Innocents</em> (image below&mdash;showing&nbsp;the execution of all young male children in the vicinity of Bethlehem ordered by King Herod to avoid the loss of his throne to a newborn King of the Jews whose birth had been announced to him by the Magi). But even here, in a scene of violent infanticide, Ghirlandaio can&rsquo;t shed his delight in fluttering, colourful sinuous draperies and an over-abundance of happy detail, which tends to highlight the ghoulishness of the dismembered baby parts strewn across the foreground, as though the putti of the Virgin&rsquo;s chamber (see the <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>&nbsp;above) had crumbled from the walls.</p>\n"

"<h3>The life of Saint&nbsp;John the Baptist</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are a number of frescoes depicting standard scenes associated with the life of the Baptist&mdash;chiefly his wanderings in the desert, during which he realizes his avocation, and his subsequent Baptism of Christ. &nbsp;But people sometimes forget that John, like Christ, was the result of a miraculous pregnancy. His parents, Zachariah and Elizabeth, had no children, but God heard&nbsp;Zachariah&rsquo;s prayers and the elderly Elizabeth found herself pregnant, three months in advance of the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary (the moment when Mary conceives Christ).&nbsp;The cycle therefore features the lovely moment of the <em>Visitation</em>, when Elizabeth and Mary encounter each other while pregnant and the unborn John &ldquo;leaps up&rdquo; in his mother&rsquo;s womb in recognition of the presence of Christ (Luke 1: 39-45). &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, The Visitation, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\n"

"\n"
"<p>In his typical fashion, Ghirlandaio sets this encounter in a hybrid city setting; the women stand just inside a medieval wall and the Virgin faces toward the gliding and omniscient presence of Giovanna Tornabuoni.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c735a35efaecf3c5d2ecb803023bc5a933fffc08.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Left to right: Mary, Elizabeth, two attendants, Giovanna Tornabuoni, and two more attendants (detail), Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>The Visitation</em>, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span>On the far right is the profile of a gleefully festooned triumphal arch. In this confrontation of architectural styles, medieval and Renaissance, the old medieval world is giving way to the newly reborn &quot;Roman&quot;&nbsp;present, a trope Ghirlandaio borrowed from contemporary Netherlandish art. St. John the&nbsp;Baptist has his own lovingly detailed birth scene, complete with a rushing female figure carrying a birth tray of fresh fruits and replenishing foods to the new mother, the ever-watchful Giovanna Tornabuoni in the foreground.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Among the other scenes here, the one in which <em>Zaccariah Writes the Name of John</em> is the most unusual. &nbsp;At the moment of the angel Gabriel&rsquo;s announcement of Elizabeth&rsquo;s pregnancy, Zaccariah asked for a sign as proof; &nbsp;because he had spoken doubtfully, he lost the power of speech, regaining it only after writing on a tablet, at Elizabeth&rsquo;s urging, &quot;His name is John&quot;&nbsp;(Luke 1:18-22). The emphasis in this scene on written evidence is, perhaps, an allusion to the world of documents and contracts that characterized the Tornabuoni banking world.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The altar wall</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, Annunciation, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3b16c93c664fcbd7afccfa0a3c71c370e3390be6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>Annunciation</em>, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span>On the lowest register, the altar wall features kneeling portraits of the donors, Giovanni Tornabuoni and his wife Francesca Pitti.&nbsp;In the upper registers, around and above the triple-mullioned stained-glass windows, we see the <em>Annunciation</em> and <em>St John in the Desert</em>, then scenes from the lives of two prominent Dominican saints, appropriate in a Dominican church. &nbsp;In one, Saint&nbsp;Dominic Tests Books in Fire and in the other we see the Death of Saint&nbsp;Peter Martyr. The cycle on this wall culminates in a <em>Coronation of the Virgin with Saints</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Again, for Ghirlandaio, God is clearly always in the details.

"<h3>A wide variety</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Egyptian artists used a wide array of materials, both local and imported, from very early in their history. For instance, already in the Predynastic period we find figurines carved from lapis lazuli&mdash;a lustrous blue stone that originates in what is now Afghanistan and indicates the early presence of robust trade routes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Group of stones collected in Egypt showing the range of colors and textures available to the ancient artists.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0a313364208470ac760c46d4d60995fd0d4ca734.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Group of stones collected in Egypt showing the range of colors and textures available to the ancient artists.</span></span></p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Menkaure (Mycerinus) and Khamerernebty(?), graywacke, c. 2490-2472 B.C.E.

(Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)</span></span>There were numerous native stones used for statuary, including the ubiquitous soft limestone of the desert cliffs that line most of the Nile valley, as well as sandstone, calcite, and schist.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Harder stones include quartzite, diorite, granite, and basalt. Carving on softer stones was done using copper chisels and stone tools; hard stone required tools of yet harder stone, copper alloys, and the use of abrasive sand to shape them. Polishing was achieved with a smooth rubbing stone and abrasive sands with a fine grit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Painted Statuary</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most statuary was painted; even stones selected for the symbolism of their color were often painted. For instance, the exemplary statues of Menkaure (left), builder of the smallest of the three major pyramids at Giza, were executed in dark schist (also called graywacke). This smooth black stone is connected with Osiris, resurrected god of the dead who was often shown with black or green skin referring to the fertile silt and lush vegetation of the Nile valley.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These images preserve traces of red paint on the king&rsquo;s skin indicating that, when completed and placed in his memorial temple near his pyramid, they would have appeared lifelike in coloration. With time, the paint would have flaked away, revealing the black stone underneath and explicitly linking the deceased king with the Lord of the Underworld.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Wood</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Egyptian artists also used a variety of woods in their work, including the native acacia, tamarisk, and sycamore fig as well as fir, cedar, and other conifers imported from Syria. Artisans excelled at puzzling together small, irregular pieces of wood and pegged them into place to create statuary, coffins, boxes, and furniture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Metals</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>They also executed pieces in various metals, including copper, copper alloys (such as bronze), gold, and silver. Cult statues of gods were made in gold and silver&mdash;materials identified by myth as their skin and bones&mdash;and were often quite small. Very few metal statues survive because they were often melted down and the material reused, although preserved examples from the Old and Middle Kingdoms demonstrate that they were skilled not only in sheet metal forming, but also practiced complex casting.</p>\n"

A cache of royal jewelry from the tombs of Middle Kingdom princesses displays extremely high levels of skill in terms of design as well as precisely cut stone inlays, repouss&eacute;, and cloisonn&eacute;.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many objects, especially small amulets and inlays, were made from a manufactured material known as Egyptian faience. This quartz-based medium could be easily shaped, molded, and mass produced. The glaze coating could be almost any color, depending on the minerals used in the composition, although turquoise blue is the most common.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><br />\n"
"&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Relief Sculpture</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Relief was usually carved before being painted. The two primary classes of relief are raised relief (where the figures stand up out from the surface) and sunk relief (where the figures are cut into and below the surface). The surface would be smoothed with a layer of plaster and then painted. If the surface was not carved before painting, several layers of mud plaster would be applied to create a flat plane.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Painted raised relief in the Temple of Seti I at Abydos (New Kingdom)\n"

"\n"
"<p>The drawing surface would be delineated using gridded guidelines, snapped onto the wall using string coated in red pigment dust (very much like chalk lines used by modern carpenters). This grid helped the artists properly proportion the figures and lay out the scenes. Scene elements were drafted out using red paint, corrections noted in black paint, and then the painting was executed one color at a time. Even on carved relief, many elements in a scene would be executed only in paint and not cut into the surface.</p>\n"

"<h3>A wide variety</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Egyptian artists used a wide array of materials, both local and imported, from very early in their history. For instance, already in the Predynastic period we find figurines carved from lapis lazui&mdash;a lustrous blue stone that originates in what is now Afghanistan and indicates the early presence of robust trade routes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Group of stones collected in Egypt showing the range of colors and textures available to the ancient artists.\" src=\"http://khan.smarthistory.org/assets/images/images/Egyptian-stones.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Group of stones collected in Egypt showing the range of colors and textures available to the ancient artists.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Stone</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Menkaure (Mycerinus) and Khamerernebty(?), graywacke, c. 2490-2472 B.C.E. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\" src=\"http://khan.smarthistory.org/assets/images/images/menkaure-mfa.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Menkaure (Mycerinus) and Khamerernebty(?), graywacke, c. 2490-2472 B.C.E. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)</span></span>There were numerous native stones used for statuary, including the ubiquitous soft limestone of the desert cliffs that line most of the Nile valley, as well as sandstone, calcite, and schist.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Harder stones include quartzite, diorite, granite, and basalt. Carving on softer stones was done using copper chisels and stone tools; hard stone required tools of yet harder stone, copper alloys, and the use of abrasive sand to shape them. Polishing was achieved with a smooth rubbing stone and abrasive sands with a fine grit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Painted Statuary</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most statuary was painted; even stones selected for the symbolism of their color were often painted. For instance, the exemplary statues of Menkaure (left), builder of the smallest of the three major pyramids at Giza, were executed in dark schist (also called graywacke). This smooth black stone is connected with Osiris, resurrected god of the dead who was often shown with black or green skin referring to the fertile silt and lush vegetation of the Nile valley.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These images preserve traces of red paint on the king&rsquo;s skin indicating that, when completed and placed in his memorial temple near his pyramid, they would have appeared lifelike in coloration. With time, the paint would have flaked away, revealing the black stone underneath and explicitly linking the deceased king with the Lord of the Underworld.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Wood</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Egyptian artists also used a variety of woods in their work, including the native acacia, tamarisk, and sycamore fig as well as fir, cedar, and other conifers imported from Syria. Artisans excelled at puzzling together small, irregular pieces of wood and pegged them into place to create statuary, coffins, boxes, and furniture.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Metals</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>They also executed pieces in various metals, including copper, copper alloys (such as bronze), gold, and silver. Cult statues of gods were made in gold and silver&mdash;materials identified by myth as their skin and bones&mdash;and were often quite small. Very few metal statues survive because they were often melted down and the material reused, although preserved examples from the Old and Middle Kingdoms demonstrate that they were skilled not only in sheet metal forming, but also practiced complex casting.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Tutankhamun's lunar pectoral in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo (New Kingdom)\n"

Photo: Amy Calvert</span></span>Jewelry work was quite sophisticated even in the Old Kingdom, as demonstrated by some highly creative pieces depicted in tomb scenes. A cache of royal jewelry from the tombs of Middle Kingdom princesses displays extremely high levels of skill in terms of design as well as precisely cut stone inlays, repouss&eacute;, and cloisonn&eacute;.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many objects, especially small amulets and inlays, were made from a manufactured material known as Egyptian faience. This quartz-based medium could be easily shaped, molded, and mass produced. The glaze coating could be almost any color, depending on the minerals used in the composition, although turquoise blue is the most common.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><br />\n"
"&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Relief Sculpture</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Relief was usually carved before being painted. The two primary classes of relief are raised relief (where the figures stand up out from the surface) and sunk relief (where the figures are cut into and below the surface). The surface would be smoothed with a layer of plaster and then painted. If the surface was not carved before painting, several layers of mud plaster would be applied to create a flat plane.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Painted raised relief in the Temple of Seti I at Abydos (New Kingdom)\n"

"\n"
"<p>The drawing surface would be delineated using gridded guidelines, snapped onto the wall using string coated in red pigment dust (very much like chalk lines used by modern carpenters). This grid helped the artists properly proportion the figures and lay out the scenes. Scene elements were drafted out using red paint, corrections noted in black paint, and then the painting was executed one color at a time. Even on carved relief, many elements in a scene would be executed only in paint and not cut into the surface.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Louis&rsquo; hair is also worth noting (and not just because it&rsquo;s amazing). To modern eyes, the king&rsquo;s hair seems more appropriate for a member of KISS than for a sixty-three year old absolute monarch; however, Louis&rsquo; hair cascades down his royal robes&mdash;representing a still youthful and robust king. In official royal portraits, there was constant negotiation between historical accuracy and the ideal form. How exactly to render Louis&rsquo; hair sparked an intense debate on more than one occasion: should the hairstyle be accurate, the king presented as he actually looks, or should concessions be made so that the regal qualities of the king might be more readily apparent? Like with Louis&rsquo; (lack of) height, royal painters had to strike a balance between an identifiable and recognizable portrait and one that idealized the sitter to meet the patron&rsquo;s desired result.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"The king’s legs (detail), Hyacinthe Rigaud, Louis XIV, 1701, oil on canvas, 9’2” x 6’3” (Musée du Louvre, Paris)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1a3804d1b5d20e72b3c5375dcba20de99434eb7f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">The king&rsquo;s legs (detail), Hyacinthe Rigaud, <em>Louis XIV</em>, 1701, oil on canvas, 9&rsquo;2&rdquo; x 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Similarly, Louis&rsquo; legs, which Rigaud has cleverly and prominently displayed, are rather well defined for an aging king. Louis&rsquo; advancing age (he would die fourteen years after this portrait) is betrayed by his lined face, slight jowls, and double chin; the king was reportedly in ill health and had to have several teeth extracted due to infection. It is no coincidence that Louis is posed with his majestic robe draped over his shoulder to reveal his lower limbs: Louis had been a ballet dancer in his youth and prided himself on his dancer&rsquo;s legs. The legs, while in contrast to his aged face, suggest a vital and vigorous man, still in the prime of his power. Rigaud tempers the monarch&rsquo;s timeworn face by reminding the viewer of Louis&rsquo; athletic past; the heeled shoes are not only flattering but add several precious inches onto Louis&rsquo; height. Here, Louis is identifiable&mdash;clearly the portrait is of the king in the later years of his life&mdash;yet also idealized, his well-toned legs and lustrous hair preternaturally preserved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Success&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rigaud&rsquo;s portrait, originally commissioned as a gift for Louis&rsquo; grandson, Philip V of Spain, was so well received that Louis ultimately chose to keep it and sent a copy in its place. Rigaud&nbsp;so successfully captured power of&nbsp;Louis XIV that the image was placed over the throne and in the king&rsquo;s absence, the painting served as his proxy and courtiers were forbidden to turn their backs on the painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

In his right hand, Louis holds the royal scepter while the crown rests on the table below, just in case there were any lingering doubts that this Louis was a pretty important fellow.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Louis&rsquo; hair is also worth noting (and not just because it&rsquo;s amazing). To modern eyes, the king&rsquo;s hair seems more appropriate for a member of KISS than for a sixty-three year old absolute monarch; however, Louis&rsquo; hair cascades down his royal robes&mdash;representing a still youthful and robust king. In official royal portraits, there was constant negotiation between historical accuracy and the ideal form. How exactly to render Louis&rsquo; hair sparked an intense debate on more than one occasion: should the hairstyle be accurate, the king presented as he actually looks, or should concessions be made so that the regal qualities of the king might be more readily apparent? Like with Louis&rsquo; (lack of) height, royal painters had to strike a balance between an identifiable and recognizable portrait and one that idealized the sitter to meet the patron&rsquo;s desired result.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Similarly, Louis&rsquo; legs, which Rigaud has cleverly and prominently displayed, are rather well defined for an aging king. Louis&rsquo; advancing age (he would die fourteen years after this portrait) is betrayed by his lined face, slight jowls, and double chin; the king was reportedly in ill health and had to have several teeth extracted due to infection. It is no coincidence that Louis is posed with his majestic robe draped over his shoulder to reveal his lower limbs: Louis had been a ballet dancer in his youth and prided himself on his dancer&rsquo;s legs. The legs, while in contrast to his aged face, suggest a vital and vigorous man, still in the prime of his power. Rigaud tempers the monarch&rsquo;s timeworn face by reminding the viewer of Louis&rsquo; athletic past; the heeled shoes are not only flattering but add several precious inches onto Louis&rsquo; height. Here, Louis is identifiable&mdash;clearly the portrait is of the king in the later years of his life&mdash;yet also idealized, his well-toned legs and lustrous hair preternaturally preserved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Success&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rigaud&rsquo;s portrait, originally commissioned as a gift for Louis&rsquo; grandson, Philip V of Spain, was so well received that Louis ultimately chose to keep it and sent a copy in its place. Louis XIV so successfully captured the power of the king that the image was placed over the throne and in the king&rsquo;s absence, the painting served as his proxy and courtiers were forbidden to turn their backs on the painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Buddhism in China</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Buddhism probably arrived in China during the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E. -&nbsp;220 C.E.), and became a central feature of Chinese culture during the period of division that followed. Buddhist teaching ascribed great merit to the reproduction of images of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, in which the artisans had to follow strict rules of iconography.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A twelfth-century catalogue of the Chinese imperial painting collection lists Daoist and Buddhist works from the time of Gu Kaizhi (c.&nbsp;344-406 C.E.) onwards.

"<h3>The Valley of the Thousand Buddhas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What has survived from the Tang period (618-906) is an important collection of Buddhist paintings on silk and paper, found&nbsp;in Cave 17, in the Valley of the Thousand Buddhas at the Chinese end of the Silk Road. Since Dunhuang was under Tibetan occupation at this time, its cave shrines and paintings escaped destruction.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The &quot;Caves of the Thousand Buddhas,&quot;&nbsp;or <em>Qianfodong</em>, are situated at Mogao, about 25 kilometres south-east of the oasis town of Dunhuang in Gansu province, western China, in the middle of the desert. By the late fourth century, the area had become a busy desert crossroads on the caravan routes of the Silk Road linking China and the West. Traders, pilgrims and other travelers stopped at the oasis town to stock up with provisions, pray for the journey ahead or give thanks for their survival.&nbsp;At about this time wandering monks carved the first caves into the long cliff stretching almost 2 kilometers in length along the Daquan River.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Over the next millennium more than 1000 caves of varying sizes were dug. Around five hundred of these were decorated as cave temples, carved from the gravel conglomerate of the escarpment. This material was not suitable for sculpture, as at other famous Buddhist cave temples at Yungang and Longmen.&nbsp;The Caves of the Thousand Buddhas gained their name from the legend of a monk who dreamt he saw a cloud with a thousand Buddhas floating over the valley.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Its entrance concealed behind a wall painting, the cave remained hidden from sight for centuries, until 1900, when it was discovered by Wang Yuanlu, a Daoist monk who had appointed himself abbot and guardian of the caves. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first Western expedition to reach Dunhuang, led by a Hungarian count, arrived in 1879.

Stein reached Dunhuang and Mogao in 1907 during his second expedition to Central Asia. By this time, he had heard rumors of the walled-in cave and its contents.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After delicate negotiations with Wang Yuanlu, Stein negotiated access to the cave. &quot;Heaped up in layers,&quot;&nbsp;Stein wrote, &quot;but without any order, there appeared in the dim light of the priest&#39;s little lamp a solid mass of manuscript bundles rising to a height of nearly ten feet....

"<p>The abbot eventually sold Stein seven thousand complete manuscripts and six thousand fragments, as well as several cases loaded with paintings, embroideries and other artifacts; the money was used to fund restoration work at the caves.The manuscripts are now in the British Library and the paintings have been divided between the National Museum in New Delhi and the British Museum, where over three hundred paintings on silk, hemp and paper are kept.</p>\n"

Euthymides had a clear sense of achievement and was indeed proud of his work, boastfully challenging his friend and rival&mdash;Euphronios. He would see Euphronios often, as well as other painters in the Kerameikos&mdash;the potter&rsquo;s quarter in Athens. They would be curious to see one another&rsquo;s new work, sometimes with appreciation, sometimes with a bit of jealousy. In the evenings they often had a good time together at a symposium&nbsp;(a kind of ancient Greek male drinking party). They would drink wine mixed with water, become garrulous, loud and&mdash;if drinking went on for too long&mdash;they might even start singing and even dancing. Perhaps what is depicted on this amphora is a scene similar to those Euthymides witnessed at one of these long parties.&nbsp;Euphronios indeed was a master potter and painter, and Euthymides knew that and had a full appreciation for his work. He thought however, that his figures seemed much more lively, caught in a split of a moment, in a dancing movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beginnings of red-figure painting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Euthymides worked mainly between 515 and 500 B.C.E., in a time when artists were exploring the possibilities of red-figure technique, invented in Athens around 530 B.C.E. Both Euthymides and Euphronios belonged to a kind of camaraderie of artists, often dubbed the &ldquo;Pioneer Group&quot; by art historians&mdash;referring to their innovative efforts in the new technique. In the red-figure technique, an artist sketches figures on the&nbsp;red clay of a freshly fashioned vessel, then covers all the background with a slip (a liquid clay), which&nbsp;turns black after final firing. Details, like elements of anatomy, folds of drapery, etc. &nbsp;can be freely added with a thin brush; the slip can be darker, sometimes more diluted, brownish, adding even more variety. In the&nbsp;black-figure technique which was used previously, an artist had to fill the figures with slip, and then incise the details with a sharp burin, which was much more difficult to handle. At the time of the&nbsp;&ldquo;Pioneers,&rdquo;&nbsp; there is a general trend in Greek art to observe the reality and represent human body more realistically, leaving the more stiff archaic models behind.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>On the other side of the vase, which is probably better known, the artist gave way to his keen sense of observation, giving us a glimpse into everyday life. Three rather tipsy men dance around, enjoying their moment during a long symposium. The one on the left still keeps in his hand a kantharos&mdash;a wine cup with long handles. Euthymides made effort to show them neither completely frontally, nor completely in profile, but rather in three quarters view, in foreshortening, trying to convey a vivid, realistic image. The poses are very diversified,&nbsp;the man in the center is represented in a twisted view.&nbsp;The artist brought his&nbsp;keen sense of observation to describing&nbsp;human anatomy and movement.&nbsp;Greek vase painters often give us clear insight into everyday life&mdash;allowing us to understand daily habits, details of clothing and&nbsp;customs. Of course, these painted vases&nbsp;cannot be treated as documents, since we would not expect men to be naked at a symposium. However, appreciation for the human body and nudity was a usual part of ancient Greek culture, and it provided a way for the artist to showcase his ability.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Euthymides had a clear sense of achievement and was indeed proud of his work, boastfully challenging his friend and rival&mdash;Euphronios. He would see Euphronios often, as well as other painters in the Kerameikos&mdash;the potter&rsquo;s quarter in Athens. They would be curious to see one another&rsquo;s new work, sometimes with appreciation, sometimes with a bit of jealousy. In the evenings they often had a good time together at a symposium&nbsp;(a kind of ancient Greek male drinking party). They would drink wine mixed with water, become garrulous, loud and&mdash;if drinking went on for too long&mdash;they might even start singing and even dancing. Perhaps what is depicts on this amphora&nbsp;is a scene similar to those Euthymides&nbsp;witnessed at one of these long parties? Euphronios indeed was a master potter and painter, and Euthymides knew that and had a full appreciation for his work. He thought however, that his figures seemed much more lively, caught in a split of a moment, in a dancing movement.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beginnings of red-figure painting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Euthymides worked mainly between 515 and 500 B.C.E., in a time when artists were exploring the possibilities of red-figure technique, invented in Athens around 530 B.C.E. Both Euthymides and Euphronios belonged to a kind of camaraderie of artists, often dubbed the &ldquo;Pioneer Group&quot; by art historians&mdash;referring to their innovative efforts in the new technique. In the red-figure technique, an artist sketches figures on the&nbsp;red clay of a freshly fashioned vessel, then covers all the background with a slip (a liquid clay), which&nbsp;turns black after final firing. Details, like elements of anatomy, folds of drapery, etc. &nbsp;can be freely added with a thin brush; the slip can be darker, sometimes more diluted, brownish, adding even more variety. In the&nbsp;black-figure technique which was used previously, an artist had to fill the figures with slip, and then incise the details with a sharp burin, which was much more difficult to handle. At the time of the&nbsp;&ldquo;Pioneers,&rdquo;&nbsp; there is a general trend in Greek art to observe the reality and represent human body more realistically, leaving the more stiff archaic models behind.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Coming back again to the &ldquo;Three Revelers&rdquo; vase&mdash;on&nbsp;one side of his amphora the artist decided to decorate with a mythological scene&mdash;a solemn moment of Hector departing for the Trojan war, receiving the helmet from his mother Hecube.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>On the other side of the vase, which is probably better known, the artist gave way to his keen sense of observation, giving us a glimpse into everyday life. Three rather tipsy men dance around, enjoying their moment during a long symposium. The one on the left still keeps in his hand a kantharos&mdash;a wine cup with long handles. Euthymides made effort to show them neither completely frontally, nor completely in profile, but rather in three quarters view, in foreshortening, trying to convey a vivid, realistic image. The poses are very diversified,&nbsp;the man in the center is represented in a twisted view.&nbsp;The artist brought his&nbsp;keen sense of observation to describing&nbsp;human anatomy and movement.&nbsp;Greek vase painters often give us clear insight into everyday life&mdash;allowing us to understand daily habits, details of clothing and&nbsp;customs. Of course, these painted vases&nbsp;cannot be treated as documents, since we would not expect men to be naked at a symposium. However, appreciation for the human body and nudity was a usual part of ancient Greek culture, and it provided a way for the artist to showcase his ability.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Man Ray, Gift, c. 1958 (replica of 1921 original), painted flatiron and tacks, 15.3 x 9 x 11.4 cm (The Museum of Modern Art) © 2014 Man Ray Trust / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / ADAGP, Paris \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bf6d37b4f9d14bb133d91b0cc6be7999c0d1e26b.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Man Ray, <em>Gift</em>, c. 1958 (replica of 1921 original), painted flatiron and tacks, 15.3 x 9 x 11.4 cm (The Museum of Modern Art)</span></span>The American artist Man Ray (born Emanuel Radnitzky) arrived in Paris in 1921. Within a year, the artist had his first solo show at a Parisian gallery. Among the works he exhibited was one unlisted sculpture: the object, which he called <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Gift</em>, was an everyday flatiron with brass tacks glued in a column down its center. According to Man Ray in his autobiography <em>Self-Portrait</em>, the object was made quickly, in a bout of inspiration, the day of the gallery opening.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What do we make of Man Ray&#39;s relatively simple, yet subversive act of presenting a modified household <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Samuel Kravitt, A Sister's Hands Ironing, c. 1931-36, photo, Hancock Shaker Village, Massachusetts (Library of Congress)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3fe1aa908e34e41bb2538325d3ee3d16ad6a4001.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Samuel Kravitt, <em>A Sister&#39;s Hands Ironing</em>,&nbsp;c. 1931-36, photo, Hancock Shaker Village, Massachusetts (Library of Congress)</span></span>appliance as a work of art? The flatiron &ndash; intended to smooth wrinkles from fabric &ndash; has been rendered useless with the addition of a row of brass tacks. We are perhaps expected to react the way the store owner supposedly did when Man Ray purchased these items, by exclaiming, &ldquo;But you&#39;ll ruin the shirt if you put tacks there!&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dada, or the nonsense of the everyday</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before arriving in Paris, May Ray was associated with the New York Dada group, which included the artist Marcel Duchamp. As a loosely-affiliated group of like-minded artists, they were particularly interested in using humor and antagonism to question the definition of a work of art. Re-defining art was prevalent in Duchamp&#39;s Readymades, such as his <em>Bicycle Wheel</em>, a sculpture made by conjoining a bicycle wheel and a stool, two utilitarian objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Surrealist object&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Marcel Duchamp, Bicycle Wheel, 1951 (third version, after lost original of 1913), metal wheel mounted on painted wood stool, 129.5 x 63.5 x 41.9 cm (The Museum of Modern Art), © 2014 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / ADAGP, Paris / Estate of Marcel Duchamp\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/373c056eec2607b9f674c37180553dafb4b40744.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Marcel Duchamp, <em>Bicycle Wheel</em>, 1951 (third version, after lost original of 1913), metal wheel mounted on painted wood stool, 129.5 x 63.5 x 41.9 cm (The Museum of Modern Art)</span></span>Although made in the spirit of Dada, Man Ray&#39;s <em>The Gift</em> prefigured by several years a key artistic practice that would develop within the Surrealist movement: the &ldquo;Surrealist object,&rdquo; a type of three-dimensional art work that included found objects, modified objects, and sculpted objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Surrealist object&mdash;one of many literary and visual practices in the movement&mdash;became prominent beginning in 1936, after its association with a series of extravagant international expositions organized in London and Paris. Surrealism had been first publicly announced in 1924, with the publication of Andr&eacute; Breton&#39;s first &quot;Manifesto of Surrealism.&quot; Stridently activist, Surrealists sought to release society from cultural constraints and the need to conform to social norms, which they felt curtailed people&#39;s desires to live as they wished.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Function/Dysfunction</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of the many types of Surrealist objects that were produced, two important features are present in Man Ray&#39;s <em>The Gift</em>. First, an everyday object has been changed so that its original function is denied. Indeed, the artist&#39;s relatively simple addition of tacks transforms a useful device into a destructive one.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Second, Man Ray&#39;s alteration gives a common object a symbolic function. The flatiron, associated with social expectations of propriety and middle-class values, becomes a subversive attack on social expectations. Even if Man Ray&#39;s tack-lined iron is no longer used for pressing clothes, the object resonates with ruinous, violent possibilities.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Denial and destruction</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While denial and destruction are qualities are not intrinsic to all Surrealist art, there are striking examples, like <em>The Gift</em>, that show Surrealists working with banal objects to question the viewer&#39;s expectations, and force us to re-evaluate the function of those objects in our lives.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Wolfgang Paalen, Articulated Cloud, umbrella in foam, 1938\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2e5ddad1550c11c60a4a3aabc4a281b087aa3e21.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Wolfgang Paalen, <em>Articulated Cloud</em>, umbrella in foam, 1938</span></span>Wolfgang Paalen&#39;s work from 1938, <em>Articulated Cloud</em>, an umbrella crafted from spongy foam, denies the object&#39;s intended function by causing water to be absorbed rather than repelled. It also makes the umbrella rather useless for anyone seeking shelter from rain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Another object by Man Ray&mdash;a metronome with a photograph of a woman&#39;s open eye clipped to it&mdash;adds an ominous sense of relentless observation to an ordinary musician&#39;s timing instrument. Man Ray&#39;s title of the piece, <em>Object to Be Destroyed</em>, seems mysterious at first. But when we consider the psychological effects of such obsessive observation&mdash;and think about what kind of impulses such regulations might evoke - the artist&#39;s title becomes easier to understand.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Man Ray, Indestructible Object (or Object to Be Destroyed), 1964 (replica of 1923 original), metronome with cutout photograph of eye on pendulum, 22.5 x 11 x 11.6 cm (The Museum of Modern Art) © 2014 Man Ray Trust / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / ADAGP, Paris\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/76f2af24315e3c945958e51262e36fca2bdf48fe.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Man Ray, <em>Indestructible Object</em> (or Object to Be Destroyed), 1964 (replica of 1923 original), metronome with cutout photograph of eye on pendulum, 22.5 x 11 x 11.6 cm (The Museum of Modern Art)</span></span>No longer a simple time-keeping device, <em>Object To Be Destroyed</em> summons feelings of irritation over being watched, and powerlessness in the face of endless time. There is no means to stop the cycle, except to destroy the object itself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Don&#39;t touch the art!</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The violent implications of <em>The Gift</em> and other Surrealist objects by Man Ray came to fruition in 1957 when <em>Object to Be Destroyed</em> was lost during a Man Ray retrospective. Varying stories exist as to the fate of the sculpture. In his autobiography, Man Ray recounts that a group of students visited the exhibition and caused a scene, during which one of them walked off with the sculpture, and it was never seen again. Numerous historians, however, state that during the exhibition one of the students took the title literally and smashed it with a hammer.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Whether stolen or smashed, <em>Object to Be Destroyed</em> no longer existed. This compelled Man Ray to remake the sculpture, but he pointedly changed the title to <em>Indestructible Object</em>.</p>\n"

Among the works he exhibited was one unlisted sculpture: the object, which he called <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Gift</em>, was an everyday flatiron with brass tacks glued in a column down its center. According to Man Ray in his autobiography <em>Self-Portrait</em>, the object was made quickly, in a bout of inspiration, the day of the gallery opening.</p>\n"

"<p>What do we make of Man Ray&#39;s relatively simple, yet subversive act of presenting a modified household <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Samuel Kravitt, A Sister's Hands Ironing, c. 1931-36, photo, Hancock Shaker Village, Massachusetts (Library of Congress)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3fe1aa908e34e41bb2538325d3ee3d16ad6a4001.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Samuel Kravitt, <em>A Sister&#39;s Hands Ironing</em>,&nbsp;c. 1931-36, photo, Hancock Shaker Village, Massachusetts (Library of Congress)</span></span>appliance as a work of art? The flatiron &ndash; intended to smooth wrinkles from fabric &ndash; has been rendered useless with the addition of a row of brass tacks. We are perhaps expected to react the way the store owner supposedly did when Man Ray purchased these items, by exclaiming, &ldquo;But you&#39;ll ruin the shirt if you put tacks there!&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dada, or the nonsense of the everyday</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before arriving in Paris, May Ray was associated with the New York Dada group, which included the artist Marcel Duchamp. As a loosely-affiliated group of like-minded artists, they were particularly interested in using humor and antagonism to question the definition of a work of art. Re-defining art was prevalent in Duchamp&#39;s Readymades, such as his <em>Bicycle Wheel</em>, a sculpture made by conjoining a bicycle wheel and a stool, two utilitarian objects.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Surrealist object&mdash;one of many literary and visual practices in the movement&mdash;became prominent beginning in 1936, after its association with a series of extravagant international expositions organized in London and Paris. Surrealism had been first publicly announced in 1924, with the publication of Andr&eacute; Breton&#39;s first &quot;Manifesto of Surrealism.&quot; Stridently activist, Surrealists sought to release society from cultural constraints and the need to conform to social norms, which they felt curtailed people&#39;s desires to live as they wished.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Function/Dysfunction</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of the many types of Surrealist objects that were produced, two important features are present in Man Ray&#39;s <em>The Gift</em>. First, an everyday object has been changed so that its original function is denied. Indeed, the artist&#39;s relatively simple addition of tacks transforms a useful device into a destructive one.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Second, Man Ray&#39;s alteration gives a common object a symbolic function. The flatiron, associated with social expectations of propriety and middle-class values, becomes a subversive attack on social expectations. Even if Man Ray&#39;s tack-lined iron is no longer used for pressing clothes, the object resonates with ruinous, violent possibilities.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Denial and destruction</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While denial and destruction are qualities are not intrinsic to all Surrealist art, there are striking examples, like <em>The Gift</em>, that show Surrealists working with banal objects to question the viewer&#39;s expectations, and force us to re-evaluate the function of those objects in our lives.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Wolfgang Paalen, Articulated Cloud, umbrella in foam, 1938\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2e5ddad1550c11c60a4a3aabc4a281b087aa3e21.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Wolfgang Paalen, <em>Articulated Cloud</em>, umbrella in foam, 1938</span></span>Wolfgang Paalen&#39;s work from 1938, <em>Articulated Cloud</em>, an umbrella crafted from spongy foam, denies the object&#39;s intended function by causing water to be absorbed rather than repelled. It also makes the umbrella rather useless for anyone seeking shelter from rain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Another object by Man Ray&mdash;a metronome with a photograph of a woman&#39;s open eye clipped to it&mdash;adds an ominous sense of relentless observation to an ordinary musician&#39;s timing instrument. Man Ray&#39;s title of the piece, <em>Object to Be Destroyed</em>, seems mysterious at first. But when we consider the psychological effects of such obsessive observation&mdash;and think about what kind of impulses such regulations might evoke - the artist&#39;s title becomes easier to understand.</p>\n"

There is no means to stop the cycle, except to destroy the object itself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Don&#39;t touch the art!</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The violent implications of <em>The Gift</em> and other Surrealist objects by Man Ray came to fruition in 1957 when <em>Object to Be Destroyed</em> was lost during a Man Ray retrospective. Varying stories exist as to the fate of the sculpture. In his autobiography, Man Ray recounts that a group of students visited the exhibition and caused a scene, during which one of them walked off with the sculpture, and it was never seen again. Numerous historians, however, state that during the exhibition one of the students took the title literally and smashed it with a hammer.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Whether stolen or smashed, <em>Object to Be Destroyed</em> no longer existed. This compelled Man Ray to remake the sculpture, but he pointedly changed the title to <em>Indestructible Object</em>.</p>\n"

"<h3>Sex, Booze and 18th-Century Britain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you ever needed proof that the sex, booze and a rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll lifestyle was not a twentieth century invention, you need look no further than the satirical prints of William Hogarth. He held up a moralising mirror to eighteenth-century Britain; the harlots, the womanisers&mdash;even the clergy could not escape. Hogarth&rsquo;s prints play out the sins of eighteenth-century London in a kind of visual theatre that was entirely new and novel in their day.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4eefc3da580ebbc11899b6a2775d4c819854f9c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Harlot&#39;s Progress, plate 1</em>, 1732, etching with engraving on paper,&nbsp;31.4 x 38 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first example of these prints, which Hogarth himself termed &lsquo;modern moral subjects&rsquo;, was <em>A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress</em>. In this series, we meet the fresh faced Moll Hackabout as she arrives for the first time in London. Moll is soon preyed upon by a brothel keeper and she descends into prostitution. The tale ends with her premature death from a sexually transmitted disease, aged just twenty-three. Despite its dark subject matter <em>A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress</em> was a huge success. These prints reference characters types who were well known to their contemporary London audience. For example Moll&rsquo;s madam was the real-life Elizabeth Needham, keeper of an exclusive London brothel and her first patron, the renowned love-rat and convicted rapist, Colonel Francis Charteris.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress&nbsp;</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These sly nods to the bad guys of the day not only made the prints hugely relevant and enjoyable to their target audience but it also made them incredibly popular. <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> (1735) was Hogarth&rsquo;s second series and proved to be just as well loved. The main character is Tom Rakewell&mdash;a rake being a old fashioned term for a man of loose morals or a womaniser. Tom&rsquo;s name is intentionally general and in a modern equivalent, he might be called &lsquo;Mr. Immoral.&rsquo; Tom is not unique, he could be any number of people in eighteenth-century Britain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The series opens with a chaotic scene: Tom&rsquo;s father, who was a rich merchant, has died and Tom has returned from Oxford University to collect and spend his late father&rsquo;s wealth. He also wastes no time in rejecting his pregnant fiance, Sarah Young, by attempting to pay her off. Hogarth laces all his prints with clues to help us decode the scene. Here we can see Sarah sobbing into a hankie whilst holding her engagement ring in her hand. Her mother stands behind her angrily clutching the love letters Tom once wrote to her daughter and he holds out a handful of coins in an attempt to get rid of them. Sarah pops up throughout these prints representing a more wholesome life that he could have had.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/926ec21957ded9b4cc6541dbe73bd770018ce6c9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 2, &quot;Surrounded by Artists and Professors,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper, 35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>A Fashionable Life</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the next scene (<em>&quot;Surrounded by Artists and Professors,&quot; </em>above) Tom has already moved from his cosy, if slightly shabby family home into his new bachelor pad surrounded by a dance master, a music teacher, a poet, a tailor, a landscape gardener, a body guard and a jockey all offering their services to help Tom complete his fashionable lifestyle. He is dressed in his nightclothes indicating that he has just woken: those who wish to exploit his new found wealth are wasting no time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom&rsquo;s fashionable life also comes with fashionable vices and soon we see him in the Rose Tavern with a group of prostitutes (see <em>&quot;The Tavern Scene,&quot;</em> below). He sits on the lap of one who caresses him with one hand whilst robbing him of his watch with the other. Portraits of Roman Emperors hang on the wall behind them but the only one that has not been defaced is Nero&rsquo;s. This is perhaps hard for a modern audience to identify but there would have been a significant number of Hogarth&rsquo;s classically educated audience who got the gag: Nero was a corrupt womaniser who fiercely persecuted Christians. To the very classically aware Georgians (George II was then King) the message was clear, Christian morals are not to be found here.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>A Decadant Decline&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom&rsquo;s decadent lifestyle does not last for long and by the third scene his sedan chair is intercepted by bailiffs as he is en route to the Queen&rsquo;s birthday party. It is at this point that our heroine Sarah Young comes to the rescue. She is now working as a milliner and kindly pays Tom&rsquo;s bail. Although Sarah has saved Tom from the bailiffs, she cannot save him from himself. By the next scene he is marrying a wealthy old hag. The old woman&rsquo;s eyes lust eagerly towards the ring and Tom&rsquo;s towards her maid. In the background Sarah Young and her mother struggle to voice their objections but are held back by some of the guests.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom is wealthy again but he is no better with his money now than he was last time and soon he is on his knees in a gambling den having just squandered the lot (see <em>&quot;The Gaming House,&quot;</em> below). Excessive gambling was a real problem in the eighteenth century and whole family fortunes could be lost in one evening. Later in the century, George III&rsquo;s son, who later became George IV, had to ask Parliament for money to help him pay off his gambling debts. It was given to him but it was not long before he needed even more.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9fe82bc65faa12dca1390cbcb089947aad332913.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 6, &quot;The Gaming House,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper,&nbsp;35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Debtors&#39; Prison</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like so many others in eighteenth-century Britain, Tom finds himself in debtors&rsquo;&nbsp;prison, quickly coming to the end of his tether. On the one side his wife derides him for squandering their fortune, on the other the beer-boy and the jailer harass him to settle his weekly bill. Sarah Young, who has come to visit Tom with their child, has fainted on seeing him in this hopeless situation. This must have been very personally relevant for Hogarth as his father spent much of his childhood in a debtors&#39; prison.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>My favourite part of the series is played out in the background of this scene. Tom&rsquo;s fellow inmates are trying various schemes to get enough money to buy their freedom. However, their choice of projects cleverly illustrate just how&nbsp;impossible it was to get out of debt in Georgian Britain. One man is attempting to turn lead into gold while the other is working on solving the national debt crisis. Even Tom has written a play, though&nbsp;we can clearly see a rejection letter for it lying on the table.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/25bdb5f05075c3fef3386848453a638ebaa3ab0f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 8, &quot;The Madhouse,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper,&nbsp;35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Bedlam</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The stresses of the previous scene have proven to be more than Tom can bear and in the final scene he is found languishing in bedlam&mdash;London&rsquo;s notorious mental hospital (see <em>&quot;The Madhouse,&quot;</em> above). The mark on his chest suggests that he has stabbed himself in a failed suicide attempt. Fashionable young women, the likes of which Tom would have socialised with just a short while ago, observe the scene in amusement. All that he has left is the company and care of the faithful Sarah Young.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why so popular?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One answer is that it appealed to the contemporary concern about people from the middle classes who tried to live like aristocrats. This was a popular issue at this time as the merchant trade was creating social mobility on a scale never seen before. However if we scratch the surface of <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> we can see that a number of different types of people implicated. For example, Tom was on his way to the Queen&rsquo;s birthday party when he was stopped by bailiffs and therefore his lifestyle is actually being encouraged and supported by aristocrats. In <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em>, everyone from the Queen to the priest that performs his marriage of convenience, to common prostitutes, &nbsp;are part of the problem.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But it is not just Hogarth&rsquo;s &lsquo;take no prisoners&rsquo; approach to social commentary that made him so popular. Printed satire was actually already very common place and central London was full of bookshops and print sellers that displayed this kind of work. What Hogarth did do that was so completely novel was to tell a story through pictures, <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> is like a story board for a play. In fact, Hogarth&rsquo;s series were adapted into plays and pantomimes during his lifetime. His visual drama offered his audience a new way to enjoy satire. It is for this reason that to find comparisons and inspirations we should be looking at authors such as Hogarth&rsquo;s friend and fellow moraliser, Henry Fielding or Jonathan Swift&mdash;author of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, rather than contemporary artists. The title <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress </em>was referencing John Bunyan&rsquo;s <em>The Pilgrims Progress</em>. We can be quite sure that most people would have gotten this reference as it is thought that, at this time, this was the most read book in Britain after the Bible. Hogarth successfully borrows from popular culture in order to express complicated ideas through an enjoyable and totally accessible story. Of course Hogarth wasn&rsquo;t the first to do this, but he did it so well, he is celebrated to this day.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Bedlam</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The stresses of the previous scene have proven to be more than Tom can bear and in the final scene he is found languishing in bedlam&mdash;London&rsquo;s notorious mental hospital (see <em>&quot;The Madhouse,&quot;</em> above). The mark on his chest suggests that he has stabbed himself in a failed suicide attempt. Fashionable young women, the likes of which Tom would have socialised with just a short while ago, observe the scene in amusement. All that he has left is the company and care of the faithful Sarah Young.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why so popular?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One answer is that it appealed to the contemporary concern about people from the middle classes who tried to live like aristocrats. This was a popular issue at this time as the merchant trade was creating social mobility on a scale never seen before. However if we scratch the surface of <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> we can see that a number of different types of people implicated. For example, Tom was on his way to the Queen&rsquo;s birthday party when he was stopped by bailiffs and therefore his lifestyle is actually being encouraged and supported by aristocrats. In <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em>, everyone from the Queen to the priest that performs his marriage of convenience, to common prostitutes, &nbsp;are part of the problem.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But it is not just Hogarth&rsquo;s &lsquo;take no prisoners&rsquo; approach to social commentary that made him so popular. Printed satire was actually already very common place and central London was full of bookshops and print sellers that displayed this kind of work. What Hogarth did do that was so completely novel was to tell a story through pictures, <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> is like a story board for a play. In fact, Hogarth&rsquo;s series were adapted into plays and pantomimes during his lifetime. His visual drama offered his audience a new way to enjoy satire. It is for this reason that to find comparisons and inspirations we should be looking at authors such as Hogarth&rsquo;s friend and fellow moraliser, Henry Fielding or Jonathan Swift&mdash;author of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, rather than contemporary artists. The title <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress </em>was referencing John Bunyan&rsquo;s <em>The Pilgrims Progress</em>. We can be quite sure that most people would have gotten this reference as it is thought that, at this time, this was the most read book in Britain after the Bible. Hogarth successfully borrows from popular culture in order to express complicated ideas through an enjoyable and totally accessible story. Of course Hogarth wasn&rsquo;t the first to do this, but he did it so well, he is celebrated to this day.</p>\n"

"<p>Known today as Tell el-Muqayyar, the &quot;Mound of Pitch,&quot; the site was occupied from around 5000 B.C.E. to 300 B.C.E. Although Ur is famous as the home of the Old Testament patriarch Abraham (Genesis 11:29-32), there is no actual proof that Tell el-Muqayyar was identical with &quot;Ur of the Chaldees.&quot; In antiquity the city was known as Urim.<br />\n"

At the center of the settlement were mud brick temples dating back to the fourth millennium B.C.E.&nbsp;At the edge of the sacred area a cemetery grew up which included burials known today as the Royal Graves. An area of ordinary people&#39;s houses was excavated in which a number of street corners have small shrines. But the largest surviving religious buildings, dedicated to the moon god Nanna, also include one of the best preserved ziggurats, and were founded in the period 2100-1800 B.C.E. For some of this time Ur was the capital of an empire stretching across southern Mesopotamia. Rulers of the later Kassite and Neo-Babylonian empires continued to build and rebuild at Ur. Changes in both the flow of the River Euphrates (now some ten miles to the east) and trade routes led to the eventual abandonment of the site.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The royal graves of Ur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Close to temple buildings at the center of the city of Ur, sat&nbsp;a rubbish dump built up over centuries. Unable to use the area for building, the people of Ur started to bury their dead there. The cemetery was used between about 2600-2000 B.C.E. and hundreds of burials were made in pits. Many of these contained very rich materials.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In one area of the cemetery a group of sixteen graves was dated to the mid-third millennium. These large, shaft graves were distinct from the surrounding burials and consisted of a tomb, made of stone, rubble and bricks, built at the bottom of a pit. The layout of the tombs varied, some occupied the entire floor of the pit and had multiple chambers. The most complete tomb discovered belonged to a lady identified as Pu-abi from the name carved on a cylinder seal found with the burial.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"

"&copy; Trustees of the British Museum</span></span>The majority of graves had been robbed in antiquity but where evidence survived the main burial was surrounded by many human bodies. One grave had up to seventy-four such sacrificial victims. It is evident that elaborate ceremonies took place as the pits were filled in that included more human burials and offerings of food and objects. The excavator, Leonard Woolley thought the graves belonged to kings and queens. Another suggestion is that they belonged to the high priestesses of Ur.</p>\n"

"<h3>The city of Ur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Known today as Tell el-Muqayyar, the &quot;Mound of Pitch,&quot; the site was occupied from around 5000 B.C.E. to 300 B.C.E. Although Ur is famous as the home of the Old Testament patriarch Abraham (Genesis 11:29-32), there is no actual proof that Tell el-Muqayyar was identical with &quot;Ur of the Chaldees.&quot; In antiquity the city was known as Urim.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3367be147c2c2f98fb1276fdc20d1f874ccd81f1.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Postcard; printed; photograph showing archaeological excavations at Ur, with Arab workmen standing for scale in the excavated street of an early second millennium B.C.E. residential quarter &copy; Trustees of the British Museum</span></span>The main excavations at Ur were undertaken from 1922-34 by a joint expedition of The British Museum and the University Museum, Pennsylvania, led by Leonard Woolley. At the center of the settlement were mud brick temples dating back to the fourth millennium B.C.E.&nbsp;At the edge of the sacred area a cemetery grew up which included burials known today as the Royal Graves. An area of ordinary people&#39;s houses was excavated in which a number of street corners have small shrines. But the largest surviving religious buildings, dedicated to the moon god Nanna, also include one of the best preserved ziggurats, and were founded in the period 2100-1800 B.C.E. For some of this time Ur was the capital of an empire stretching across southern Mesopotamia. Rulers of the later Kassite and Neo-Babylonian empires continued to build and rebuild at Ur. Changes in both the flow of the River Euphrates (now some ten miles to the east) and trade routes led to the eventual abandonment of the site.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The royal graves of Ur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Close to temple buildings at the center of the city of Ur, sat&nbsp;a rubbish dump built up over centuries. Unable to use the area for building, the people of Ur started to bury their dead there. The cemetery was used between about 2600-2000 B.C.E. and hundreds of burials were made in pits. Many of these contained very rich materials.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In one area of the cemetery a group of sixteen graves was dated to the mid-third millennium. These large, shaft graves were distinct from the surrounding burials and consisted of a tomb, made of stone, rubble and bricks, built at the bottom of a pit. The layout of the tombs varied, some occupied the entire floor of the pit and had multiple chambers. The most complete tomb discovered belonged to a lady identified as Pu-abi from the name carved on a cylinder seal found with the burial.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Cylinder seal of Pu-abi, from Ur, c. 2600 B.C.E., lapis lazuli, 4.9 x 2.6 cm (The British Museum)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e20f22400074918f840f3cc28906fae235fc788c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Cylinder seal of Pu-abi</em>,&nbsp;c. 2600 B.C.E., lapis lazuli, 4.9 x 2.6 cm,&nbsp;from Ur<br />\n"
"&copy; Trustees of the British Museum</span></span>The majority of graves had been robbed in antiquity but where evidence survived the main burial was surrounded by many human bodies. One grave had up to seventy-four such sacrificial victims. It is evident that elaborate ceremonies took place as the pits were filled in that included more human burials and offerings of food and objects. The excavator, Leonard Woolley thought the graves belonged to kings and queens. Another suggestion is that they belonged to the high priestesses of Ur.</p>\n"

"<h3>The <em>Standard of Ur</em></h3>\n"

"<p>Leonard Woolley, the excavator at Ur, imagined that it was carried on a pole as a standard, hence its common name. Another theory suggests that it formed the soundbox of a musical instrument.</p>\n"

"<p>When found, the original wooden frame for the mosaic of shell, red limestone and lapis lazuli had decayed, and the two main panels had been crushed together by the weight of the soil.

"\n"
"<h3>Queen&#39;s Lyre</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Leonard Woolley discovered several lyres in the graves in the Royal Cemetery at Ur. This was one of two that he found in the grave of &quot;Queen&quot;&nbsp;Pu-abi. Along with the lyre, which stood against the pit wall, were the bodies of ten women with fine jewelry, presumed to be sacrificial victims, and numerous stone and metal vessels. One woman lay right against the lyre and, according to Woolley, the bones of her hands were placed where the strings would have been.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Imagine a man&nbsp;standing before a large fire wearing&nbsp;the&nbsp;heavy eagle mask shown above&nbsp;and a long cedar bark costume on his body. He&nbsp;begins to dance, the firelight flickers&nbsp;and the feathers rustle&nbsp;as he&nbsp;moves about the room in front of hundreds of people. Now, imagine him pulling&nbsp;the string that opens the mask, he is transformed&nbsp;into something else entirely&mdash;what a powerful and dramatic moment!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Northwest Coast transformation masks&nbsp;manifest transformation, usually an animal changing into a mythical being or one animal becoming another. Masks are&nbsp;worn by dancers during&nbsp;ceremonies, they pull&nbsp;strings to open and move the mask&mdash;in effect, animating it. In the Eagle mask shown above from&nbsp;the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, you can see the wooden frame and netting that held the mask on the dancer&rsquo;s head. When the cords are pulled, the eagle&rsquo;s face and beak split down the center, and the bottom of the beak opens&nbsp;downwards, giving the impression of a bird spreading its wings (see image below). Transformed, the mask reveals the face of an ancestor.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Transformation masks, like those belonging to the Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw (pronounced Kwak-wak-ah-wak, a Pacific Northwest Coast indigenous people) and illustrated here, are&nbsp;worn during a potlatch,&nbsp;a ceremony where the host displayed his status, in part by giving away gifts to those in attendance. These masks&nbsp;were only one part of a costume that also included a cloak made of red cedar bark. During a potlatch, Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw dancers perform wearing the mask&nbsp;and costume. The masks conveyed&nbsp;social position (only those with a certain status could wear them)&nbsp;and also helped to portray a family&rsquo;s genealogy by displaying&nbsp;(family) crest&nbsp;symbols.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masks are not the same across the First Nations of the Northwest Coastal areas; here we focus solely on Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw transformation masks.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw (&ldquo;Kwak&rsquo;wala speaking tribes&rdquo;) are generally called Kwakiutl by non-Native peoples. They are one of many indigenous groups that live on the western coast of British Columbia, Canada. The mythology and cosmology of different Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw Nations (such as the Kwagu&rsquo;ł (Kwakiutl) or &lsquo;Namgis) is extremely diverse, although&nbsp;there are commonalities. For instance, many groups relate that deceased ancestors roamed the world, transforming themselves in the process (this might entail removing their animal skins or masks to reveal their human selves within).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw bands are arranged into four clans (Killer Whale, Eagle, Raven, and Wolf clans). The clans are divided into <em>numayn</em> (or <em>&lsquo;na&rsquo;mina</em>), which can be loosely translated as &ldquo;group of fellows of the same kind&rdquo; (essentially groups that shared a common ancestor). <em>Numayns</em> were responsible for safe-guarding crest&nbsp;symbols and for conveying their specific rights&mdash;which might include access to natural resources (like salmon fishing areas) and rights to sacred names and dances that related to a <em>numayn&rsquo;s</em> ancestor or the group&rsquo;s origins. The <em>numayn</em> were ranked, and typically only one person could fill a spot at any given moment in time. Each rank entailed specific rights, including ceremonial privileges&mdash;like the right to wear a mask such as the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s Thunderbird transformation mask. Animal transformation masks contained crests for a given <em>numayn</em>. Ancestral entities and supernatural forces temporarily embody dancers wearing these masks and other ceremonial regalia.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Many myths relate moments of transformation often involving trickster supernaturals (a trickster is a god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphic animal who exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behavior). Raven, for instance, is known as a consummate trickster&mdash;he often changes into other creatures, and helps&nbsp;humans by providing them with a variety of useful&nbsp;things such as&nbsp;the sun, moon, fire, and salmon.&nbsp;Thunderbird (<em>Kwankwanxwalige&rsquo;</em>), who was a mythical ancestor of the Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw, also figures prominently in mythology. He is believed to cause thunder when he beats his wings, and&nbsp;lightning comes from his eyes. He lives in the celestial realm, and he can remove his bird skin to assume human form.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Design and materials</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The masks illustrated here display a variety of brightly colored surfaces filled with complex forms. These&nbsp;masks use elements of the formline style, a term coined&nbsp;in 1965 to describe the characteristics of Northwest Coast visual culture. The Brooklyn Museum mask provides a clear example of what constitutes the formline style. For instance, The Brooklyn Museum mask (when open) displays a color palette of mostly red, blue-green, and black, which is consistent with other formline objects like a Tlingit Raven Screen (a house partition screen) attributed to Kadyisdu.axch&rsquo; (detail below). The masks, whether opened or closed, are bilaterally symmetrical. Typical of the formline style is the use of an undulating, calligraphic line. Also, note how the pupils of the eyes on the exterior of the Brooklyn Museum mask&nbsp;are ovoid shapes, similar to the figures and forms found on the interior surfaces of many masks. This ovoid shape, along with s- and u-forms, are common&nbsp;features of the formline style. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The American Museum of Natural History and Brooklyn Museum masks are carved of red cedar wood, an important and common material used for many Northwest Coast objects and buildings. Masks take months, sometimes years, to create. Because they are made of wood and other organic materials that quickly decay, most masks date to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (even though we know that the practice extends much farther into the past). In fact, the artistic style of many transformation masks it thought to have emerged over a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>With the introduction and enforcement of Christianity and as a result of colonization in the nineteenth century, masking practices changed among peoples of the Northwest Coast. Prior to contact with Russians, Europeans, and Euro-Americans, masks like the Brooklyn Museums&rsquo;s Thunderbird Transformation Mask, were not carved using metal tools. After iron tools were introduced along with other materials and equipment, masks demonstrate different carving techniques. Earlier masks used natural (plant and mineral based) pigments, post-contact,&nbsp;brighter and more durable synthetic colors were introduced. The open mask from the American Museum of Natural History, for example, displays bright red, yellow, and blue.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ceremonies and potlatches&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masks passed between family members of a specific clan (they could be inherited or gifted).

Franz Boas, an anthropologist who worked in this area between 1885 and 1930, noted that &ldquo;The acquisition of a high position and the maintenance of its dignity require correct marriages and wealth&mdash;wealth accumulated by industry and by loaning out property at interest&mdash;dissipated at the proper time, albeit with the understanding that each recipient of a gift has to return it with interest at a time when he is dissipating his wealth.

"<p>Imagine a man&nbsp;standing before a large fire wearing&nbsp;the&nbsp;heavy eagle mask shown above&nbsp;and a long cedar bark costume on his body. He&nbsp;begins to dance, the firelight flickers&nbsp;and the feathers rustle&nbsp;as he&nbsp;moves about the room in front of hundreds of people.

"<p>Northwest Coast transformation masks&nbsp;manifest transformation, usually an animal changing into a mythical being or one animal becoming another. Masks are&nbsp;worn by dancers during&nbsp;ceremonies, they pull&nbsp;strings to open and move the mask&mdash;in effect, animating it. In the Eagle mask shown above from&nbsp;the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, you can see the wooden frame and netting that held the mask on the dancer&rsquo;s head. When the cords are pulled, the eagle&rsquo;s face and beak split down the center, and the bottom of the beak opens&nbsp;downwards, giving the impression of a bird spreading its wings (see image below). Transformed, the mask reveals the face of an ancestor.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Transformation masks, like those belonging to the Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw (pronounced Kwak-wak-ah-wak, a Pacific Northwest Coast indigenous people) and illustrated here, are&nbsp;worn during a potlatch,&nbsp;a ceremony where the host displayed his status, in part by giving away gifts to those in attendance. These masks&nbsp;were only one part of a costume that also included a cloak made of red cedar bark. During a potlatch, Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw dancers perform wearing the mask&nbsp;and costume. The masks conveyed&nbsp;social position (only those with a certain status could wear them)&nbsp;and also helped to portray a family&rsquo;s genealogy by displaying&nbsp;(family) crest&nbsp;symbols.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masks are not the same across the First Nations of the Northwest Coastal areas; here we focus solely on Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw transformation masks.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw (&ldquo;Kwak&rsquo;wala speaking tribes&rdquo;) are generally called Kwakiutl by non-Native peoples. They are one of many indigenous groups that live on the western coast of British Columbia, Canada. The mythology and cosmology of different Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw Nations (such as the Kwagu&rsquo;ł (Kwakiutl) or &lsquo;Namgis) is extremely diverse, although&nbsp;there are commonalities. For instance, many groups relate that deceased ancestors roamed the world, transforming themselves in the process (this might entail removing their animal skins or masks to reveal their human selves within).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw bands are arranged into four clans (Killer Whale, Eagle, Raven, and Wolf clans). The clans are divided into <em>numayn</em> (or <em>&lsquo;na&rsquo;mina</em>), which can be loosely translated as &ldquo;group of fellows of the same kind&rdquo; (essentially groups that shared a common ancestor). <em>Numayns</em> were responsible for safe-guarding crest&nbsp;symbols and for conveying their specific rights&mdash;which might include access to natural resources (like salmon fishing areas) and rights to sacred names and dances that related to a <em>numayn&rsquo;s</em> ancestor or the group&rsquo;s origins. The <em>numayn</em> were ranked, and typically only one person could fill a spot at any given moment in time. Each rank entailed specific rights, including ceremonial privileges&mdash;like the right to wear a mask such as the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s Thunderbird transformation mask. Animal transformation masks contained crests for a given <em>numayn</em>. Ancestral entities and supernatural forces temporarily embody dancers wearing these masks and other ceremonial regalia.</p>\n"

"<h3>Animals and myths</h3>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/faa833a939f592b786f406e4fcb8b0fafc6da176.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Transformation Mask</em>, Kwakiutl population, British Columbia, Canada,&nbsp;wood paint, graphite, cedar, cloth, string, 34 X 53 cm closed, 130 cm open (Quai Branly Museum). &quot;This transformation mask opens into two sections. Closed, it represents a crow or an eagle; when spread out, a human face appears. It was associated with initiation rites that took place during the winter. During these ceremonies, both religious and theatrical, the spirit of the ancestors was supposed to enter into men.&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/collections/tailor-made-walks/claude-levi-strauss-walk-amongst-the-objects.html?tx_fepromenadealacartet3_pi1%5Buid%5D=596\">source</a>)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many myths relate moments of transformation often involving trickster supernaturals (a trickster is a god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphic animal who exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behavior). Raven, for instance, is known as a consummate trickster&mdash;he often changes into other creatures, and helps&nbsp;humans by providing them with a variety of useful&nbsp;things such as&nbsp;the sun, moon, fire, and salmon.&nbsp;Thunderbird (<em>Kwankwanxwalige&rsquo;</em>), who was a mythical ancestor of the Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw, also figures prominently in mythology. He is believed to cause thunder when he beats his wings, and&nbsp;lightning comes from his eyes. He lives in the celestial realm, and he can remove his bird skin to assume human form.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Design and materials</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The masks illustrated here display a variety of brightly colored surfaces filled with complex forms. These&nbsp;masks use elements of the formline style, a term coined&nbsp;in 1965 to describe the characteristics of Northwest Coast visual culture. The Brooklyn Museum mask provides a clear example of what constitutes the formline style. For instance, The Brooklyn Museum mask (when open) displays a color palette of mostly red, blue-green, and black, which is consistent with other formline objects like a Tlingit Raven Screen (a house partition screen) attributed to Kadyisdu.axch&rsquo; (detail below). The masks, whether opened or closed, are bilaterally symmetrical. Typical of the formline style is the use of an undulating, calligraphic line. Also, note how the pupils of the eyes on the exterior of the Brooklyn Museum mask&nbsp;are ovoid shapes, similar to the figures and forms found on the interior surfaces of many masks. This ovoid shape, along with s- and u-forms, are common&nbsp;features of the formline style. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The American Museum of Natural History and Brooklyn Museum masks are carved of red cedar wood, an important and common material used for many Northwest Coast objects and buildings. Masks take months, sometimes years, to create. Because they are made of wood and other organic materials that quickly decay, most masks date to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (even though we know that the practice extends much farther into the past). In fact, the artistic style of many transformation masks it thought to have emerged over a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>With the introduction and enforcement of Christianity and as a result of colonization in the nineteenth century, masking practices changed among peoples of the Northwest Coast. Prior to contact with Russians, Europeans, and Euro-Americans, masks like the Brooklyn Museums&rsquo;s Thunderbird Transformation Mask, were not carved using metal tools. After iron tools were introduced along with other materials and equipment, masks demonstrate different carving techniques. Earlier masks used natural (plant and mineral based) pigments, post-contact,&nbsp;brighter and more durable synthetic colors were introduced. The open mask from the American Museum of Natural History, for example, displays bright red, yellow, and blue.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>After <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em></span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the end of 1821 the leading Romantic painter in France, Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, returned from a year long stay in England where crowds had flocked to see his masterpiece <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em> displayed in the Egyptian Hall in Pall Mall, London. Despite the success of the exhibition, the French government still refused to buy the painting and his own prodigious spending meant that he was strapped for cash and in no position to embark on another ambitious and expensive large scale project like The Raft. His health too was soon to suffer. On his return to France, a riding accident led to complications, causing a tumor to develop on the spine that proved fatal. He died, aged 32, in January 1824.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f20d063f697a43fb0b0d729114775d848e3583f3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>A Woman Addicted to Gambling</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 77 x 64 cm (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of his last years were his portraits of the insane. There were ten of them originally. Only five have survived: <em>A Woman Addicted to Gambling</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Child Snatcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Kleptomaniac</em>; and&nbsp;<em>A Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Command</em>. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>No information is available for those that have been lost. According to the artist&rsquo;s first biographer, Charles Cl&eacute;ment, G&eacute;ricault painted them after returning from England for &Eacute;tienne-Jean Georget (1795-1828), the chief physician of the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, the women&rsquo;s asylum in Paris. The paintings were certainly in Georget&rsquo;s possession when he died.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Three Theories for the Commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How the two men met is not known for sure. Possibly Georget treated G&eacute;ricault as a patient, or perhaps they met in the Beaujon Hospital, from whose morgue G&eacute;ricault had taken home dissected limbs to serve as studies for his figures in The Raft. What is more debated though, is Georget&rsquo;s role in the production of the paintings. There are three main theories. The first two link the portraits to the psychological toll taken out of G&eacute;ricault whilst producing his great masterpiece and the nervous breakdown he is believed to have suffered in the autumn following its completion in 1819. The first theory runs that Georget helped him to recover from this episode and that the portraits were produced for and given to the doctor as a gesture of thanks; the second puts forward that Georget, as the artist&rsquo;s physician, encouraged G&eacute;ricault to paint them as an early form of art therapy; and the third is that G&eacute;ricault painted them for Georget after his return from England to assist his studies in mental illness.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is this last that is generally held to be the most likely. Stylistically, they belong to the period after his stay in England, two years after his breakdown. Also, the unified nature of the series, in terms of their scale, composition and color scheme suggest a clearly defined commission, while the medical concept of &ldquo;monomania&rdquo; shapes the whole design.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Early Modern Psychiatry</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A key figure in early modern psychiatry in France was Jean-Etienne-Dominique Esquirol (1772-1840), whose main area of interest was &ldquo;monomania,&rdquo; a term no longer in clinical use, which described a particular fixation leading sufferers to exhibit delusional behavior, imagining themselves to be a king, for example. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/528d22d27c06d93d134d282dab4f4582ce5b0d86.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault,<em> Portait of a Child Snatcher,</em> 1822, oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm (Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield, Massachusetts)</span></span>Esquirol, who shared a house with his friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Georget, was a great believer in the now largely discredited science of physiognomy, holding that physical appearances could be used to diagnose mental disorders. With this in mind, he had over 200 drawings made of his patients, a group of which, executed by Georges-Francoise Gabriel, were exhibited at the Salon of 1814. As an exhibitor himself that year, it seems highly likely that G&eacute;ricault would have seen them there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Georget&rsquo;s work developed on Esquirol&rsquo;s. &nbsp;An Enlightenment figure, Esquirol rejected moral or theological explanations for mental illness, seeing insanity, neither as the workings of the devil nor as the outcome of moral decrepitude, but as an organic affliction, one that, like any other disease, can be identified by observable physical symptoms. In his book <em>On Madness</em>, published in 1820, following Esquirol, Georget turns to physiognomy to support this theory:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>In general the idiot&rsquo;s face is stupid, without meaning; the face of the manic patient is as agitated as his spirit, often distorted and cramped; the moron&rsquo;s facial characteristics are dejected and without expression; the facial characteristics of the melancholic are pinched, marked by pain or extreme agitation; the monomaniacal king has a proud, inflated expression; the religious fanatic is mild, he exhorts by casting his eyes at the heavens or fixing them on the earth; the anxious patient pleads, glancing sideways, etc.</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The clumsy language here&mdash;&ldquo;the idiot&rsquo;s face is stupid&rdquo;&mdash;seems a world away from G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s extraordinarily sensitive paintings, a point that begs the question whether G&eacute;ricault was doing more than simply following the good doctor&rsquo;s orders in producing the series, but instead making his own independent enquiries.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>After <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em></span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the end of 1821 the leading Romantic painter in France, Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, returned from a year long stay in England where crowds had flocked to see his masterpiece <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em> displayed in the Egyptian Hall in Pall Mall, London. Despite the success of the exhibition, the French government still refused to buy the painting and his own prodigious spending meant that he was strapped for cash and in no position to embark on another ambitious and expensive large scale project like The Raft. His health too was soon to suffer. On his return to France, a riding accident led to complications, causing a tumor to develop on the spine that proved fatal. He died, aged 32, in January 1824.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f20d063f697a43fb0b0d729114775d848e3583f3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>A Woman Addicted to Gambling</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 77 x 64 cm (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of his last years were his portraits of the insane. There were ten of them originally. Only five have survived: <em>A Woman Addicted to Gambling</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Child Snatcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Kleptomaniac</em>; and&nbsp;<em>A Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Command</em>. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>No information is available for those that have been lost. According to the artist&rsquo;s first biographer, Charles Cl&eacute;ment, G&eacute;ricault painted them after returning from England for &Eacute;tienne-Jean Georget (1795-1828), the chief physician of the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, the women&rsquo;s asylum in Paris. The paintings were certainly in Georget&rsquo;s possession when he died.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Three Theories for the Commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How the two men met is not known for sure. Possibly Georget treated G&eacute;ricault as a patient, or perhaps they met in the Beaujon Hospital, from whose morgue G&eacute;ricault had taken home dissected limbs to serve as studies for his figures in The Raft. What is more debated though, is Georget&rsquo;s role in the production of the paintings. There are three main theories. The first two link the portraits to the psychological toll taken out of G&eacute;ricault whilst producing his great masterpiece and the nervous breakdown he is believed to have suffered in the autumn following its completion in 1819. The first theory runs that Georget helped him to recover from this episode and that the portraits were produced for and given to the doctor as a gesture of thanks; the second puts forward that Georget, as the artist&rsquo;s physician, encouraged G&eacute;ricault to paint them as an early form of art therapy; and the third is that G&eacute;ricault painted them for Georget after his return from England to assist his studies in mental illness.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is this last that is generally held to be the most likely. Stylistically, they belong to the period after his stay in England, two years after his breakdown. Also, the unified nature of the series, in terms of their scale, composition and color scheme suggest a clearly defined commission, while the medical concept of &ldquo;monomania&rdquo; shapes the whole design.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Early Modern Psychiatry</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A key figure in early modern psychiatry in France was Jean-Etienne-Dominique Esquirol (1772-184), whose main area of interest was &ldquo;monomania,&rdquo; a term no longer in clinical use, which described a particular fixation leading sufferers to exhibit delusional behavior, imagining themselves to be a king, for example. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/528d22d27c06d93d134d282dab4f4582ce5b0d86.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault,<em> Portait of a Child Snatcher,</em> 1822, oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm (Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield, Massachusetts)</span></span>Esquirol, who shared a house with his friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Georget, was a great believer in the now largely discredited science of physiognomy, holding that physical appearances could be used to diagnose mental disorders. With this in mind, he had over 200 drawings made of his patients, a group of which, executed by Georges-Francoise Gabriel, were exhibited at the Salon of 1814. As an exhibitor himself that year, it seems highly likely that G&eacute;ricault would have seen them there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Georget&rsquo;s work developed on Esquirol&rsquo;s. &nbsp;An Enlightenment figure, Esquirol rejected moral or theological explanations for mental illness, seeing insanity, neither as the workings of the devil nor as the outcome of moral decrepitude, but as an organic affliction, one that, like any other disease, can be identified by observable physical symptoms. In his book <em>On Madness</em>, published in 1820, following Esquirol, Georget turns to physiognomy to support this theory:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>In general the idiot&rsquo;s face is stupid, without meaning; the face of the manic patient is as agitated as his spirit, often distorted and cramped; the moron&rsquo;s facial characteristics are dejected and without expression; the facial characteristics of the melancholic are pinched, marked by pain or extreme agitation; the monomaniacal king has a proud, inflated expression; the religious fanatic is mild, he exhorts by casting his eyes at the heavens or fixing them on the earth; the anxious patient pleads, glancing sideways, etc.</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The clumsy language here&mdash;&ldquo;the idiot&rsquo;s face is stupid&rdquo;&mdash;seems a world away from G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s extraordinarily sensitive paintings, a point that begs the question whether G&eacute;ricault was doing more than simply following the good doctor&rsquo;s orders in producing the series, but instead making his own independent enquiries.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6c61cfc6bf1185ca13f02e4bf676e234b74a5317.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>Portait of a Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy (The Hyena)</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 72 x 58 cm (Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, Lyons)</span></span>G&eacute;ricault had many reasons to be interested in psychiatry, starting with his own family: his grandfather and one of his uncles had died insane.

"<p>Located in Conques, the Church of Saint-Foy (Saint Faith) is an important pilgrimage church on the route to Santiago de Compostela in Northern Spain. It is also an abbey, meaning that the church was part of a monastery where monks lived, prayed and worked. Only small parts of the monastery have survived but the church remains largely intact. Although smaller churches stood on the site from the seventh century, the Church of Saint-Foy was begun in the eleventh century and completed in the mid-twelfth century. As a Romanesque church, it has a barrel-vaulted nave lined with arches on the interior.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>It is known as a pilgrimage church&nbsp;because many of the large churches long the route to Santiago de Compostela took a similar shape. The main feature of these churches was the cruciform plan. Not only did this plan take the symbolic form of the cross but it also helped control the crowds of pilgrims. In most cases, pilgrims could enter the western portal and then circulate around the church towards the apse at the eastern end. The apse usually contained smaller chapels, known as radiating chapels, where pilgrims could visit saint&rsquo;s shrines, especially the sanctuary of Saint Foy. They could then circulate around the ambulatory and out the transept, or crossing. This design helped to regulate the flow of traffic throughout the church although the intention and effective use of this design has been debated.</p>\n"

"<p>Pilgrims arriving in Conques had one thing on their mind: the reliquary of Saint Foy. This reliquary, or container holding the remains of a saint or holy person, was one of the most famous in all of Europe. So famous that it was originally located in a monastery in Agen but the monks at Conques plotted to steal it in order to attract more wealth and visitors. The reliquary at Conques held the remains of Saint Foy, a young Christian convert living in Roman-occupied France during the second century. At the age of twelve, she was condemned to die for her refusal to sacrifice to pagan gods, she is therefore revered&nbsp;as a martyr, as&nbsp;someone who dies for their faith. Saint Foy was a very popular saint in Southern France&nbsp;and her relic&nbsp;was extremely important to&nbsp;the church;&nbsp;bringing pilgrams and wealth to the small, isolated town of Conques.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the date of the reliquary is unknown, Bernard of Angers first spoke it about in 1010. At first, Bernard was frightened that the statue was too beautiful stating, &quot;Brother, what do you think of this idol? Would Jupiter or Mars consider himself unworthy of such a statue?&quot; He was concerned about idolatry&mdash;that pilgrims would begin to worship the jewel-encrusted reliquary rather than what that reliquary contained and represented, the holy figure of Saint Foy. Indeed, the gold and gem encrusted statue would been&nbsp;quite a sight for the pilgrims.&nbsp;Over time, travelers paid homage to Saint Foy by donating&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33 1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: Holly Hayes (CC BY-NC 2.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7598d1c8c3349dc7e3715d46fe699a481d8c44f6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33-1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sacred_destinations/2649842024/in/photostream/\">Holly Hayes </a>(CC BY-NC 2.0)</span></span>gemstones for the reliquary so that her dress is&nbsp;covered with agates, amethysts, crystals, carnelians, emeralds, garnets, hematite, jade, onyx, opals, pearls, rubies, sapphires, topazes, antique cameos and intaglios.

"<p>Imagine you pack up your belongings in a sack, tie on your cloak, and start off on a months-long journey though treacherous mountains, unpredictable weather and unknown lands. For the medieval pilgrim, life was a spiritual journey. Why did people in the Middle Ages take pilgrimages? There are many reasons, but visiting a holy site meant being closer to God.

"<p>Located in Conques, high up in the Pyrenees Mountains between Spain and France, the Church of Saint-Foy (Saint Faith) is an important pilgrimage church on the route to Santiago de Compostela in Northern Spain. It is also an abbey, meaning that the church was part of a monastery where monks lived, prayed and worked. Only small parts of the monastery have survived but the church remains largely intact. Although smaller churches stood on the site from the seventh century, the Church of Saint-Foy was begun in the eleventh century and completed in the mid-twelfth century. As a Romanesque church, it has a barrel-vaulted nave lined with arches on the interior.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>It is known as a pilgrimage church&nbsp;because many of the large churches long the route to Santiago de Compostela took a similar shape. The main feature of these churches was the cruciform plan. Not only did this plan take the symbolic form of the cross but it also helped control the crowds of pilgrims. In most cases, pilgrims could enter the western portal and then circulate around the church towards the apse at the eastern end. The apse usually contained smaller chapels, known as radiating chapels, where pilgrims could visit saint&rsquo;s shrines, especially the sanctuary of Saint Foy. They could then circulate around the ambulatory and out the transept, or crossing. This design helped to regulate the flow of traffic throughout the church although the intention and effective use of this design has been debated.</p>\n"

"<p>When shots rang out in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, Europe began hurtling towards one of the deadliest conflicts the world has ever seen. Gavrilo Princip&rsquo;s assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, brought long-brewing political tension to a head. By August 4, 1914, the Central Powers (Germany, Bulgaria, Austro-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Entente or Allied Powers (France, Britain, Russia, Italy, and later the United States), were officially engaged in the First World War.</p>\n"

World War I, also known as the Great War, was a distinctly modern conflict in many ways. However, like wars throughout history, it inspired a tremendous amount of creative output from artists and writers, civilians and combatants, men and women. Though we may read about dates and numbers when we study historic conflicts, the lived reality of a war becomes much more vivid when we look at the diverse creative expressions it inspires. The varied perspectives represented in the First World War art show us that there was not one single uniform war experience for Britons, whether on the battlefield or at home. In fact, we could say that British artists and writers witnessed and experienced different wars even though only one conflict is recorded in history. War-related art also had many purposes, whether to document, commemorate, appeal, revise, expose, obscure, or protest.</p>\n"

"<h3>Carrying poetry to war</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>First World War literature also presents a range of perspectives. Rupert Brooke&rsquo;s patriotic &lsquo;1914&rsquo; sonnet sequence became hugely popular in the early years of the war. At the outset of the war, many Britons were touched by the heroic sentiments of the poems, in particular, &ldquo;The Soldier.&rdquo; This poem&rsquo;s combatant speaker assures the reader that his death in battle will mean that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some corner of a foreign field/That is for ever England.&rdquo; Brooke&rsquo;s poems pictured military service and death as purifying and noble. At the start of the war, when such nationalistic feeling was strong, many British soldiers departed for training with a copy of Brooke&rsquo;s poems tucked into their kits. However, after years of devastating losses and with no clear resolution to the seemingly endless fighting, poets depicting the hard reality of the soldier&rsquo;s experience gained more recognition. Wilfred Owen&rsquo;s gloomy 1917 &ldquo;Anthem for Doomed Youth&rdquo; pictures the war&rsquo;s fallen &ldquo;d[ying] as cattle,&rdquo; for example. Siegfried Sassoon&rsquo;s 1918 piece, &ldquo;Counter-Attack,&rdquo; offers us the gruesome vision of a battlefield &ldquo;place rotten with dead&rdquo; where corpses &ldquo;face downward, in the sucking mud,/Wallow&hellip;&rdquo; Sassoon&rsquo;s shocking verbal image recalls the horrible tableau of Nevinson&rsquo;s dead soldiers lying facedown in the mud.</p>\n"

"<h3>A Brief Introduction to WWI and Its Representation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When shots rang out in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, Europe began hurtling towards one of the deadliest conflicts the world has ever seen. Gavrilo Princip&rsquo;s assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, brought long-brewing political tension to a head. By August 4, 1914, the Central Powers (Germany, Bulgaria, Austro-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Entente or Allied Powers (France, Britain, Russia, Italy, and later the United States), were officially engaged in the First World War.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Britain at War, August 5, 1914, letterpress on newsprint, 76.3 x 50.7 cm, published by The Times (Imperial War Museum)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c57df3e79e57318533eb91365fd29ca9084e3ec4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Britain at War</em>, August 5, 1914, letterpress on newsprint, 76.3 x 50.7 cm, published by <em>The Times</em> (Imperial War Museum, London)</span></span>The crisis would last until November 11, 1918 and claim millions of lives, with battlefronts in Europe, European waters, and in the Middle and Near East. World War I, also known as the Great War, was a distinctly modern conflict in many ways. However, like wars throughout history, it inspired a tremendous amount of creative output from artists and writers, civilians and combatants, men and women. Though we may read about dates and numbers when we study historic conflicts, the lived reality of a war becomes much more vivid when we look at the diverse creative expressions it inspires. The varied perspectives represented in the First World War art show us that there was not one single uniform war experience for Britons, whether on the battlefield or at home. In fact, we could say that British artists and writers witnessed and experienced different wars even though only one conflict is recorded in history. War-related art also had many purposes, whether to document, commemorate, appeal, revise, expose, obscure, or protest.</p>\n"

We know that the central figure is an Oba because of his distinctive coral beaded regalia. Also, attendants hold shields above his head, either to protect him from attack or possibly from the hot, tropical sun. This was a privilege only afforded to an Oba.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figures around him range in size, not because of their actual height or distance from the Oba, but rather due to their level of importance within the court. This convention of sizing human figures based on status is known as &ldquo;hieratic scale&rdquo; and is found in artwork from cultures around the world and across time. The Oba would have travelled with a large cohort of attendants, warriors, servants, diplomats, chieftains, and priests. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The plaque originally hung alongside many others on posts throughout the palace of the Oba. The order of their placement on these posts would have told the history of the royal lineage of Benin&rsquo;s Obas, who traced their dynasty all the way back to Oranmiyan, whose son was the first Oba of Benin. However, the sequence of plaques is lost to us since they were long held in storage when found by westerners in the 19th century. You may notice that the Oba rides sidesaddle on horseback, which would seem to indicate a connection to Oba Esigie (who ruled c. 1504-1550), the first Oba to travel by horse. However, without knowing the original order of the plaques, we will never know for certain whether this was Esigie, or a later Oba who emulated his brash new mode of travel.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Artists working in brass were organized under Esigie. Today, artists working in brass in Benin are part of a brass workers guild, and it was likely that previous generations would have also worked collectively. These artists created plaques and other sculptures using what is known as the &ldquo;lost wax casting technique,&rdquo; in which, first, a more malleable wax version of the final brass work is made. It is then covered in clay and fired to harden the clay, removing the wax, which melts away in the process (hence the term, &ldquo;lost wax&rdquo;). Hot, molten liquid brass is then poured into the clay mold. As the brass cools, it hardens, and the clay is removed, revealing the finished plaque.&nbsp;</p>\n"

We know that the central figure is an Oba because of his distinctive coral beaded regalia. Also, attendants hold shields above his head, either to protect him from attack or possibly from the hot, tropical sun. This was a privilege only afforded to an Oba.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figures around him range in size, not because of their actual height or distance from the Oba, but rather due to their level of importance within the court. This convention of sizing human figures based on status is known as &ldquo;hieratic scale&rdquo; and is found in artwork from cultures around the world and across time. The Oba would have travelled with a large cohort of attendants, warriors, servants, diplomats, chieftains, and priests. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The plaque originally hung alongside many others on posts throughout the palace of the Oba. The order of their placement on these posts would have told the history of the royal lineage of Benin&rsquo;s Obas, who traced their dynasty all the way back to Oranmiyan, whose son was the first Oba of Benin. However, the sequence of plaques is lost to us since they were long held in storage when found by westerners in the 19th century. You may notice that the Oba rides sidesaddle on horseback, which would seem to indicate a connection to Oba Esigie (who ruled c. 1504-1550), the first Oba to travel by horse. However, without knowing the original order of the plaques, we will never know for certain whether this was Esigie, or a later Oba who emulated his brash new mode of travel.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Artists working in brass were organized under Esigie. Today, artists working in brass in Benin are part of a brass workers guild, and it was likely that previous generations would have also worked collectively. These artists created plaques and other sculptures using what is known as the &ldquo;lost wax casting technique,&rdquo; in which, first, a more malleable wax version of the final brass work is made. It is then covered in clay and fired to harden the clay, removing the wax, which melts away in the process (hence the term, &ldquo;lost wax&rdquo;). Hot, molten liquid brass is then poured into the clay mold. As the brass cools, it hardens, and the clay is removed, revealing the finished plaque.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"

Her father, Frederik Ruysch, was an eminent scientist and professor of anatomy and botany. He possessed a well-known collection of rare natural history specimens, which Rachel helped catalogue and record. He encouraged her artistic talents, careful observation of the natural world and scientifically accurate renderings of plants and flowers.&nbsp;<span>At age fifteen, Ruysch began an apprenticeship with famous still life painter Willem van Aelst. By eighteen, she was already producing her first still life paintings and starting to establish her long and successful career.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Working Mother</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At twenty nine, Rusch married portrait painter Juriaen Pool, with whom she had ten children. Despite her enormous domestic responsibilities, she was remarkably prolific, producing more than 250 paintings over seven decades. Her works were in great demand, and she achieved widespread fame and international recognition. Considered one of the most successful artists of her day, contemporary Dutch writers called her &ldquo;Holland&rsquo;s art prodigy&rdquo; and &ldquo;our subtle art heroine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Consumer Society</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1648, the Netherlands became independent from Spain, ushering in a period of great economic prosperity. Flourishing international trade and a thriving capitalistic economy resulted in a newly affluent middle class. Wealthy merchants created a new kind of patronage and art market. Without a powerful monarchy or the Catholic Church to commission artworks (the Dutch were Protestants), artists produced directly for buyers. Like today, buyers purchased art either from professional dealers or from the artist in their studios. Subjects like big historical, mythological or religious paintings were no longer desired; buyers wanted portraits, still lifes, landscapes and genre paintings (scenes of everyday life) to decorate their homes. Proud of their newly independent country and trade wealth, they desired artworks that would reflect their success. In a competitive open market, artists began to specialize. Rachel Ruysch became known as one of the greatest flower painters of her time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Flowers: A National Passion</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Great Tulip Book: Semper Augustus, 1600-1699, gouache on paper, 12-1/8 x 7-7/8 inches / 30.8 x 20.0 cm (Norton Simon Museum)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/67d8a2d36cf67e2e3545a6aacba3e2d1d20cf675.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Great Tulip Book: Semper Augustus, 1600-1699, gouache on paper, 12-1/8 x 7-7/8 inches / 30.8 x 20.0 cm (Norton Simon Museum)</span></span>Ruysch&rsquo;s career paralleled the growth of the Dutch horticultural industry and the science of botany. The Netherlands became the largest importers of new and exotic plants and flowers from around the world. Once valued primarily for their use as herbs or medicine, flowers became newly appreciated simply for their beauty and fragrance. They became prized luxuries and desirable status symbols for the wealthy. Botanists and gardeners sought the rarest specimens imported from overseas trade. The tulip, like the one featured prominently in Ruysch&rsquo;s painting below, was the most exotic.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;Tulip Mania&rdquo;&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Coveted for their intense and unusually varied colors, tulips were introduced into the Netherlands from Turkey in the late 16th century. The Dutch fell madly in love with them. Because it takes so long for a tulip to be grown from seed, demand far outpaced supply. The rarest and most valuable tulips were the variegated or &ldquo;flamed&rdquo; tulips, those with feathers of contrasting color on their petals. This exotic coloration was actually caused by a virus that infected the tulip, shortening its life span and making it even more sought after and valuable. The stage was set for a buying craze.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Buyer Beware: A Cautionary Tale?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Bruegel suggests the economic folly of tulip mania by depicting speculators as brainless monkeys in contemporary upper class dress (detail),  Brueghel the Younger, Satire on Tulip Mania, c. 1640 (Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem)\n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c738bf4ab1af15143f5e83166e5913111a11a17d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Bruegel suggests the economic folly of tulip mania by depicting speculators as brainless monkeys in contemporary upper class dress (detail), Brueghel the Younger, <em>Satire on Tulip Mania</em>, c. 1640 (Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The word tulip mania is often used today to refer to certain types of economic crises. It describes a financial bubble caused by large numbers of people speculating on unproved commodities or companies. Tulip bulbs were so avidly desired in 17th century Netherlands that a &ldquo;futures market&rdquo; was born. &nbsp;Buyers bought bulbs still in the ground, speculating that they would be worth more in the future and could then be sold for a large profit. Prices rose steadily and irrationally. At the peak of tulip speculation in 1636, some bulbs sold for more than a skilled craftsman earned in ten years. A nursery catalog of the time notes that at the height of the madness, a rare &ldquo;Semper Augustus&rdquo; tulip sold for 5,200 guiders, more than the price of a fine house, a ship or twelve acres of land.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In February, 1637, investors suddenly decided that tulip bulbs were grossly overpriced, and began to sell. Within days, panic ensued. With more sellers than buyers, demand for tulips evaporated. Prices plummeted, tulip bulbs lost 90% of their earlier value, and the market crashed. The world had just experienced its first financial bubble. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<h3>Look Closely: Microscopic Detail</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Rachel Ruysch, Flower Still Life, c. 1726, oil on canvas, 75.6 x 60.6 cm (Toledo Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c2f66c7f2523493f729085ad2b4263213b9616c6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Rachel Ruysch, Flower Still Life, c. 1726, oil on canvas, 75.6 x 60.6 cm (Toledo Museum of Art)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A successful Dutch still life painting was highly valued for its degree of skillful realism. <em>Flowers Still Life</em> depicts a profusion of scientifically accurate floral details. Each petal, stem, and leaf is minutely and precisely rendered. Textures are remarkably realistic, from the delicate paper thin poppy petals to the crinkly, brittle leaves. Looking closer still, we see that Ruysch has also meticulously depicted tiny insects: a caterpillar crawls on a stem, a bee gathers pollen from the center of a poppy, a white butterfly alights on a marigold.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Mixed Bouquet</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Flowers spilling out of the vase (detail), Rachel Ruysch, Flower Still Life, c. 1726, oil on canvas, 75.6 x 60.6 cm (Toledo Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ff2895619f1d6b81437c91831cc3cdc77b318d28.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">A drooping marigold and other flowers spilling out of the vase (detail), Rachel Ruysch, <em>Flower Still Life</em>, c. 1726, oil on canvas, 75.6 x 60.6 cm (Toledo Museum of Art)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>Flower&nbsp;Still Life</em> depicts a lush variety of different flowers, from popular common European blooms to rare overseas species. Ruysch combines a complex and intricate arrangement of poppies, snapdragons, roses, carnations, hollyhocks, marigolds, morning glories and a single red and white flamed tulip. Flowers lavishly spill out of the vase, filling the entire picture space. Some are in full bloom, others droop and wilt, as leaves and curving stems entwine throughout.&nbsp;While many of her contemporary flower painters used more symmetrical and formal compositions, Ruysch was known for these lively and informal looking arrangements. The flowers are asymmetrically arranged, leading the eye diagonally from the lower left drooping marigold to the upper right red poppy. Our eye is first attracted to the lightest flowers in the center, then to the brightly colored surrounding flowers, and finally out to the small darker flowers at the edges of the bouquet. Complementary colors create harmony, as warm yellows and rose balance cool blues and greens. Light alternates with shadow, enlivening the flowers as they stand out dramatically against the darker background.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;Vanitas&rdquo;: Hidden Meanings?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some scholars believe there is another way to view Ruysch&rsquo;s flower paintings. One common interpretation is to understand them in light of <em>vanitas</em>, a moral message common at the time. Taken from a passage in the Christian bible, it was a reminder that beauty fades and all living things must die. While still life paintings celebrated the beauty and luxury of fine food or voluptuous flowers, <em>vanitas</em> was a warning about the fleeting nature of these material things and the shortness of life. In <em>Flowers Still Life</em>, some flowers wilt and die while insects have eaten holes in the leaves. Wealthy Dutch consumers were being reminded to not become too attached to their material possessions and worldly pleasures; eternal salvation came only through devotion to God.</p>\n"

Subjects like big historical, mythological or religious paintings were no longer desired; buyers wanted portraits, still lifes, landscapes and genre paintings (scenes of everyday life) to decorate their homes. Proud of their newly independent country and trade wealth, they desired artworks that would reflect their success. In a competitive open market, artists began to specialize. Rachel Ruysch became known as one of the greatest flower painters of her time.</p>\n"

The Netherlands became the largest importers of new and exotic plants and flowers from around the world. Once valued primarily for their use as herbs or medicine, flowers became newly appreciated simply for their beauty and fragrance. They became prized luxuries and desirable status symbols for the wealthy. Botanists and gardeners sought the rarest specimens imported from overseas trade. The tulip, like the one featured prominently in Ruysch&rsquo;s painting below, was the most exotic.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;Tulip Mania&rdquo;&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Coveted for their intense and unusually varied colors, tulips were introduced into the Netherlands from Turkey in the late 16th century. The Dutch fell madly in love with them. Because it takes so long for a tulip to be grown from seed, demand far outpaced supply. The rarest and most valuable tulips were the variegated or &ldquo;flamed&rdquo; tulips, those with feathers of contrasting color on their petals. This exotic coloration was actually caused by a virus that infected the tulip, shortening its life span and making it even more sought after and valuable. The stage was set for a buying craze.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The word tulip mania is often used today to refer to certain types of economic crises. It describes a financial bubble caused by large numbers of people speculating on unproved commodities or companies. Tulip bulbs were so avidly desired in 17th century Netherlands that a &ldquo;futures market&rdquo; was born. &nbsp;Buyers bought bulbs still in the ground, speculating that they would be worth more in the future and could then be sold for a large profit. Prices rose steadily and irrationally. At the peak of tulip speculation in 1636, some bulbs sold for more than a skilled craftsman earned in ten years. A nursery catalog of the time notes that at the height of the madness, a rare &ldquo;Semper Augustus&rdquo; tulip sold for 5,200 guiders, more than the price of a fine house, a ship or twelve acres of land.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In February, 1637, investors suddenly decided that tulip bulbs were grossly overpriced, and began to sell. Within days, panic ensued. With more sellers than buyers, demand for tulips evaporated. Prices plummeted, tulip bulbs lost 90% of their earlier value, and the market crashed. The world had just experienced its first financial bubble. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>A successful Dutch still life painting was highly valued for its degree of skillful realism. <em>Flowers Still Life</em> depicts a profusion of scientifically accurate floral details. Each petal, stem, and leaf is minutely and precisely rendered. Textures are remarkably realistic, from the delicate paper thin poppy petals to the crinkly, brittle leaves. Looking closer still, we see that Ruysch has also meticulously depicted tiny insects: a caterpillar crawls on a stem, a bee gathers pollen from the center of a poppy, a white butterfly alights on a marigold.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><em>Flower&nbsp;Still Life</em> depicts a lush variety of different flowers, from popular common European blooms to rare overseas species. Ruysch combines a complex and intricate arrangement of poppies, snapdragons, roses, carnations, hollyhocks, marigolds, morning glories and a single red and white flamed tulip. Flowers lavishly spill out of the vase, filling the entire picture space. Some are in full bloom, others droop and wilt, as leaves and curving stems entwine throughout.&nbsp;While many of her contemporary flower painters used more symmetrical and formal compositions, Ruysch was known for these lively and informal looking arrangements. The flowers are asymmetrically arranged, leading the eye diagonally from the lower left drooping marigold to the upper right red poppy. Our eye is first attracted to the lightest flowers in the center, then to the brightly colored surrounding flowers, and finally out to the small darker flowers at the edges of the bouquet. Complementary colors create harmony, as warm yellows and rose balance cool blues and greens. Light alternates with shadow, enlivening the flowers as they stand out dramatically against the darker background.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;Vanitas&rdquo;: Hidden Meanings?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some scholars believe there is another way to view Ruysch&rsquo;s flower paintings. One common interpretation is to understand them in light of <em>vanitas</em>, a moral message common at the time. Taken from a passage in the Christian bible, it was a reminder that beauty fades and all living things must die. While still life paintings celebrated the beauty and luxury of fine food or voluptuous flowers, <em>vanitas</em> was a warning about the fleeting nature of these material things and the shortness of life. In <em>Flowers Still Life</em>, some flowers wilt and die while insects have eaten holes in the leaves. Wealthy Dutch consumers were being reminded to not become too attached to their material possessions and worldly pleasures; eternal salvation came only through devotion to God.</p>\n"

"<p>In terms of painting, Europe was most definitely leading the way, the Louvre first opening its doors to the public in 1793, granting access to the French royal family&rsquo;s former collection of art.

"\n"
"<p><span>While lagging behind in some ways, in others London was somewhat ahead of the rest.

"\n"
"<p>The Museum, in its first incarnation, was located in a grand mansion on Montague Street, the site of the present building.

"<h3>One of the greatest neoclassical interiors in London</h3>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The commission for the new building was given to Robert Smirke, a well-established neoclassical architect. The building took around thirty years to complete, its elevation mirroring the expanse of the British Empire itself. He started with the east wing, built to house the King&rsquo;s Library. It survives complete today and is considered one of the greatest neoclassical interiors in London.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In 1827 construction on the remaining wings was begun, creating the famous quadrangle with its impressive colonnaded portico and two acre courtyard. The antique sourcing of the fa&ccedil;ade is predictable enough. Neoclassicism had been the prevailing fashion in European architecture since the 1750s and would have seemed an appropriate choice, especially given the number and quality of classical sculptures in the Museum (particularly the Parthenon sculptures). &nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These must surely have influenced Smirke&rsquo;s design of the main entrance, which is modelled on Greek temple design and shares the same number of eight columns as the Parthenon itself. In scale though it is almost double the size, while the austere doric order is replaced by the based and slender columns and scrolled capitals of the ionic order, which, with all its connotations of wisdom and learning, must have been thought best suited for the building&rsquo;s purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/805eb25ee0b11867161224a78dad19415c1d4435.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Entablature (detail) Robert Smirke, The British Museum, 1823-57 (London)</span></span>The entablature (the entire horizontal area carried by the columns) is composed of a tripartite architrave (the lowest part of the entablature) with a blind frieze above (without sculptural decoration) and a dentilated cornice (dentils are the repeated blocks forming a pattern at the base of the cornice)&mdash;all running in an unbroken chain around the whole length of the south portico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The building is topped with a flat roof, the pediment therefore being false, in the sense that its function is decorative rather than structural, its pinnacle creating a vertical axis that bisects the main entrance way. The projecting wings, like the skene or scenic backdrop in an ancient Greek theatre, add&nbsp;a dramatic sweep to the fa&ccedil;ade, channelling the eye of the viewer to the main entrance.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The conscious reworking of the classical language of architecture, drawing on a period which, according to enlightened tastes, marked the greatest flowering of art and culture in European history, obviously served to elevate the status of the building, expressing something of the pride and confidence of the British at the very heyday of their empire. While not necessarily equating Britain with Rome or Greece, the building did seem to suggest, firstly, that the British were carrying the torch of civilisation and, secondly, that they, like the Romans and the Greeks before them, were up to the task.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This explicit nationalist message is illustrated in the pediment sculptures, designed by Richard Westmacott and given the grandiose name,<em> The Rise of Civilisation</em>. Here we see a female Britannia-like figure representing Enlightenment, surrounded by other allegorical figures standing for various artistic and scientific disciplines.</p>\n"
"\n"

"<span>Pediment of British Museum, 1845-51 (London)</span></span></span>To the far left, however, we find a different story. Here early man emerges, crawling from rubble to be handed the Lamp of Knowledge by the Angel of Enlightenment, behind him is a dog-like animal and behind that a crocodile. Though hard to pick out from ground level, that crocodile&rsquo;s snout is one of the most telling details in the whole sculpture, offering a foretaste of the debates that were soon to rage between religious and scientific communities. Though Darwin had yet to publish his On the Origin of Species, with the type of fossil and geological evidence that the Museum was amassing, the case for evolution was certainly mounting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>New Technologies</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although on the face of it, the Museum might seem to be a very conservative building, the manner in which it was constructed was anything but. Smirke, for instance, was one of the first architects to make extensive use of concrete, laying it as a base for the cast iron frame that underpins the entire structure, a frame that was then filled with London stock brick and covered in a facing of Portland stone,<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/401d6350ef493bfcfe137085b78cd8180cb05ff4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Weston Hall, 1845-47, The British Museum (London)</span></span> brought all the way from Dorset.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the design of the interior, too, which was overseen by Smirke&rsquo;s brother, Sydney from 1845 onwards, British materials were used throughout, the floor of the entrance hall&mdash;the Weston Hall&mdash;being paved with York stone, the staircase balustrade and ornamental vases carved from Huddlestone stone and the sides of the Grand Staircase lined with red Aberdeen granite. While, the fact that these materials were all sourced from the British Isles reinforced the nationalist message, the vivid colours of the stones themselves created a luminous interior that was further adorned with colorful designs based on those found on classical buildings, which by the nineteenth century were known to be polychromatic. The original stonework has all survived to this day, while the 1847 painting and gilding was restored in 2000. The electric lamps in the hall are also replicas of the original, installed in 1879, making the Museum one of the first public buildings in London to be electrically lit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Reading Room</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the 1850s, with the collection continuing to expand, the site needed a yet larger library, the idea this time being to construct a round room in the central courtyard. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d99be86f90777578a8b4d8c434a8ff6678b08036.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Reading Room, 1854-7, The British Museum (London)</span></span>Designed by Sydney Smirke, the Reading Room was built between 1854-1857. Given the size of it, 42.6m in diameter, the speed of construction, even assisted by modern building techniques, was astounding. Using cast iron, concrete and glass, it was a masterpiece of nineteenth-century technology, inspired as much by Paxton&rsquo;s ferrovitreous Crystal Palace as by the Pantheon in Rome; the airy and graceful internal dome disguising the complex fretwork of cast iron that supported it from without. Even the bookshelves were state-of-the-art, built of iron to carry the weight of the books and making up a staggering three miles of cases and twenty-five miles of shelving.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Recent Times</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This was not the end of the story, though. In 1997, the books were relocated yet again to the newly built British Library on Euston Road and the old Reading Room transformed into an exhibition space, a move that provided the catalyst to revitalise the old courtyard. In 2000, Foster and Partner&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II Great Court was opened and the two buildings, the Museum and the Reading Room, were now connected with a huge glazed canopy spanning the two acres of the courtyard. And the story still continues, for even more recently yet more changes have been made, with the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centres, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners, due to open in 2014.</span><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beedf6420cb14db2fb3f8591a7084c3644f5c0ce.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Foster and Partners, Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, 1997</span></span>That the site is a constantly evolving one is only to be expected, given the ever-changing nature of the collection itself. An astonishing compendium of 260 years of human discoveries, the British Museum is indeed a house filled with many mansions, the outside of which, in the last analysis, however brilliant and varied in its construction it may be, will never come close to matching the glories within.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/805eb25ee0b11867161224a78dad19415c1d4435.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Entablature (detail) Robert Smirke, The British Museum, 1823-57 (London)</span></span>The entablature (the entire horizontal area carried by the columns) is composed of a tripartite architrave (the lowest part of the entablature) with a blind frieze above (without sculptural decoration) and a dentilated cornice (dentils are the repeated blocks forming a pattern at the base of the cornice)&mdash;all running in an unbroken chain around the whole length of the south portico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The building is topped with a flat roof, the pediment therefore being false, in the sense that its function is decorative rather than structural, its pinnacle creating a vertical axis that bisects the main entrance way. The projecting wings, like the skene or scenic backdrop in an ancient Greek theatre, adds a dramatic sweep to the fa&ccedil;ade, channelling the eye of the viewer to the main entrance.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The conscious reworking of the classical language of architecture, drawing on a period which, according to enlightened tastes, marked the greatest flowering of art and culture in European history, obviously served to elevate the status of the building, expressing something of the pride and confidence of the British at the very heyday of their empire. While not necessarily equating Britain with Rome or Greece, the building did seem to suggest, firstly, that the British were carrying the torch of civilisation and, secondly, that they, like the Romans and the Greeks before them, were up to the task.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This explicit nationalist message is illustrated in the pediment sculptures, designed by Richard Westmacott and given the grandiose name,<em> The Rise of Civilisation</em>. Here we see a female Britannia-like figure representing Enlightenment, surrounded by other allegorical figures standing for various artistic and scientific disciplines.</p>\n"

"<span>Pediment of British Museum, 1845-51 (London)</span></span></span>To the far left, however, we find a different story. Here early man emerges, crawling from rubble to be handed the Lamp of Knowledge by the Angel of Enlightenment, behind him is a dog-like animal and behind that a crocodile. Though hard to pick out from ground level, that crocodile&rsquo;s snout is one of the most telling details in the whole sculpture, offering a foretaste of the debates that were soon to rage between religious and scientific communities. Though Darwin had yet to publish his On the Origin of Species, with the type of fossil and geological evidence that the Museum was amassing, the case for evolution was certainly mounting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>New Technologies</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although on the face of it, the Museum might seem to be a very conservative building, the manner in which it was constructed was anything but. Smirke, for instance, was one of the first architects to make extensive use of concrete, laying it as a base for the cast iron frame that underpins the entire structure, a frame that was then filled with London stock brick and covered in a facing of Portland stone,<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/401d6350ef493bfcfe137085b78cd8180cb05ff4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Weston Hall, 1845-47, The British Museum (London)</span></span> brought all the way from Dorset.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the design of the interior, too, which was overseen by Smirke&rsquo;s brother, Sydney from 1845 onwards, British materials were used throughout, the floor of the entrance hall&mdash;the Weston Hall&mdash;being paved with York stone, the staircase balustrade and ornamental vases carved from Huddlestone stone and the sides of the Grand Staircase lined with red Aberdeen granite. While, the fact that these materials were all sourced from the British Isles reinforced the nationalist message, the vivid colours of the stones themselves created a luminous interior that was further adorned with colorful designs based on those found on classical buildings, which by the nineteenth century were known to be polychromatic. The original stonework has all survived to this day, while the 1847 painting and gilding was restored in 2000. The electric lamps in the hall are also replicas of the original, installed in 1879, making the Museum one of the first public buildings in London to be electrically lit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Reading Room</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the 1850s, with the collection continuing to expand, the site needed a yet larger library, the idea this time being to construct a round room in the central courtyard. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d99be86f90777578a8b4d8c434a8ff6678b08036.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Reading Room, 1854-7, The British Museum (London)</span></span>Designed by Sydney Smirke, the Reading Room was built between 1854-1857. Given the size of it, 42.6m in diameter, the speed of construction, even assisted by modern building techniques, was astounding. Using cast iron, concrete and glass, it was a masterpiece of nineteenth-century technology, inspired as much by Paxton&rsquo;s ferrovitreous Crystal Palace as by the Pantheon in Rome; the airy and graceful internal dome disguising the complex fretwork of cast iron that supported it from without. Even the bookshelves were state-of-the-art, built of iron to carry the weight of the books and making up a staggering three miles of cases and twenty-five miles of shelving.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Recent Times</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This was not the end of the story, though. In 1997, the books were relocated yet again to the newly built British Library on Euston Road and the old Reading Room transformed into an exhibition space, a move that provided the catalyst to revitalise the old courtyard. In 2000, Foster and Partner&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II Great Court was opened and the two buildings, the Museum and the Reading Room, were now connected with a huge glazed canopy spanning the two acres of the courtyard. And the story still continues, for even more recently yet more changes have been made, with the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centres, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners, due to open in 2014.</span><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beedf6420cb14db2fb3f8591a7084c3644f5c0ce.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Foster and Partners, Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, 1997</span></span>That the site is a constantly evolving one is only to be expected, given the ever-changing nature of the collection itself. An astonishing compendium of 260 years of human discoveries, the British Museum is indeed a house filled with many mansions, the outside of which, in the last analysis, however brilliant and varied in its construction it may be, will never come close to matching the glories within.</p>\n"

Painted largely out of doors at the &quot;Lover&rsquo;s Seat&quot; (a scenic outlook) above Covehurst Bay near Hastings on the south coast of England, the scene captures a tranquil spot inhabited only by a flock of sheep. The rather daring composition and the attention to natural detail make this painting unique.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Hunt captures the beauty of an English summer day. The brightness of the sunlight is interrupted only by the shadows of the clouds they move across the landscape. The sea glitters in the distance on the far left. The cliffs are pushed up to the top of the picture frame, leaving little room for the sky.

"\n"
"<h3>Pre-Raphaelite Truth to Nature</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>True to the ideals of Pre-Raphaelitism, Hunt painted every flower, bramble and blade of grass with extreme attention to detail. The texture gives the impression that you could reach out feel the uneven clumps of wool on the sheep, and Hunt even pays attention to the red marking, used to differentiate ownership, on each member of the flock. Hunt, who had introduced the Pre-Raphaelites to the ideas of John Ruskin, was perhaps the most faithful follower of Ruskin&rsquo;s advice to &ldquo;go to Nature in all singleness of heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n"
"&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Political and Moral Content</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Also following in the tradition of Ruskin is the fact that the painting carries a moral content. The title <em>Our English Coasts</em> related to the fact that at the time of the unguarded state of the many miles of English coastline was a serious topic of discussion at the time. The European revolutions of 1848 had made Britons nervous, and it was as yet unclear what the relationship was to be with France&rsquo;s new ruler Napoleon III.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The painting&rsquo;s subtitle, <em>Strayed Sheep</em>, relates to the more Biblical message of the painting. There is no shepherd tending the flock, some of which are perched perilously close to the edge of the cliff. In this the message relates to the moral of Hunt&rsquo;s <em>The Hireling Shepherd</em>, in which a beautiful woman distracts the shepherd while the flock behind him gets into all kinds of trouble. Interestingly, when Hunt exhibited the painting in France in 1855, the<em> Our English Coasts</em> part of the title was dropped.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Hunt and the Pre-Raphaelites</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Hunt was born in London in 1827 and became a student at the Royal Academy School in 1844, where he met Millais. He also became a close friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti when the two bonded over a mutual regard for the work of the poet Keats. He was an important force in the early years of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the subjects and moral content of his paintings frequently reflect his own deeply religious nature.&nbsp;</p>\n"

How much has the world changed since when you were a kid? There was no internet, and no personal computers. Your parents didn&rsquo;t own a minivan or SUV&mdash;those didn&rsquo;t exist yet. Commercial airplanes were brand new. The world was still recovering from World War II, and if you lived in the United States you likely lived in mortal fear of a nuclear attack from the USSR. Life in 2013 may resemble life in 1950 in some ways, but there&rsquo;s no question the world is a different place, a more advanced, stranger place.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Industrial Revolution Changed Everything</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>That was the point of view of British artist Joseph Mallord William Turner (commonly known by his initials J.M.W.) in 1839. J.M.W. Turner was born in 1775, less than a month after the start of the American Revolutionary War. He grew up in a United Kingdom whose empire stretched across the globe under the watchful eye of its navy, and whose military prowess was encouraged by a booming economy driven by the Industrial Revolution.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Industrial Revolution, between roughly 1760 and 1830, brought great positive change to Great Britain. Steam power heralded a machine age filled with factories and mechanical processes. Innovations in textile machinery increased industrial output thousands of times, iron became cheap and strong enough to become an everyday building material, and gas lamps meant people could be active at all hours of the day and night. Populations increased, consumer goods became more affordable, and the middle class exploded. There was a palpable understanding that the world was changing forever.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, not all things improved. Even though the average income grew during the industrial age, standards of living plummeted for most, as did conditions in urban housing and in the new factories. Child labor was not only legal, it was expected. Despite its economic successes, the Industrial Revolution was not without serious problems.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Brave Historical Legacy</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Clarkson Frederick Stanfield, Sketch for &quot;The Battle of Trafalgar, and the Victory of Lord Nelson over the Combined French and Spanish Fleets,&quot; 1805 1833 (Tate, London).

Stanfield may have depicted the Temeraire, illuminated in the foreground and flying the British flag.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ambiguity was on Turner&rsquo;s mind when he began work on his painting, whose full title is&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up</em>,<em> 1838</em>. He was familiar with the namesake ship, HMS Temeraire, as were all Britons of the day. Temeraire was the hero of the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where Napoleon&#39;s forces were defeated, and which secured British naval dominance for the next century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the late 1830s, however, Temeraire was no longer relevant. After retiring from service in 1812 she was converted into a hulk, a ship that can float but not actually sail. She spent time as a prison ship, housing ship, and storage depot before she was finally decommissioned in 1838 and sent up the River Thames to a shipyard in London to be broken into scrap materials. That trip on the Thames was witnessed by Turner, who used it as inspiration for his famous painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Clash of Technology</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For many Britons, Temeraire was a powerful reminder of their nation&rsquo;s long history of military success and a living connection to the heroes of the Napoleonic Wars. Its disassembly signaled the end of an historical era. Turner celebrates Temeraire&rsquo;s heroic past, and he also depicts a technological change which had already begun to affect modern-day life in a more profound way than any battle.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rather than placing Temeraire in the middle of his canvas, Turner paints the warship near the left edge of the canvas. He uses shades of white, grey, and brown for the boat, making it look almost like a ghost ship. The mighty warship is being pulled along by a tiny black tugboat, whose steam engine is more than strong enough to control its larger counterpart. Turner transforms the scene into an allegory about how the new steam power of the Industrial Revolution quickly replaced history and tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Believe it or not, tugboats were so new that there wasn&rsquo;t even a word for what the little ship was doing to Temeraire. According to the&nbsp;Oxford English Dictionary, Turner&rsquo;s title for his painting is the first ever recorded use of the word &ldquo;tugged&rdquo; to describe a steamship pulling another boat.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to the inventive title, Turner included in the exhibition catalog the following lines of text, which he modified from a poem by Thomas Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ye Mariners of England&rdquo;:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The flag which braved the battle and the breeze<br />\n"
"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No long owns her</p>\n"

How much has the world changed since when you were a kid? There was no internet, and no personal computers. Your parents didn&rsquo;t own a minivan or SUV&mdash;those didn&rsquo;t exist yet. Commercial airplanes were brand new. The world was still recovering from World War II, and if you lived in the United States you likely lived in mortal fear of a nuclear attack from the USSR. Life in 2013 may resemble life in 1950 in some ways, but there&rsquo;s no question the world is a different place, a more advanced, stranger place.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Industrial Revolution Changed Everything</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>That was the point of view of British artist Joseph Mallord William Turner (commonly known by his initials J.M.W.) in 1839. J.M.W. Turner was born in 1775, less than a month after the start of the American Revolutionary War. He grew up in a United Kingdom whose empire stretched across the globe under the watchful eye of its navy, and whose military prowess was encouraged by a booming economy driven by the Industrial Revolution.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Industrial Revolution, between roughly 1760 and 1830, brought great positive change to Great Britain. Steam power heralded a machine age filled with factories and mechanical processes. Innovations in textile machinery increased industrial output thousands of times, iron became cheap and strong enough to become an everyday building material, and gas lamps meant people could be active at all hours of the day and night. Populations increased, consumer goods became more affordable, and the middle class exploded. There was a palpable understanding that the world was changing forever.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, not all things improved. Even though the average income grew during the industrial age, standards of living plummeted for most, as did conditions in urban housing and in the new factories. Child labor was not only legal, it was expected. Despite its economic successes, the Industrial Revolution was not without serious problems.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Brave Historical Legacy</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/18917b044822b73c612d41ec858271347f865dca.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Clarkson Frederick Stanfield, <em>Sketch for &quot;The Battle of Trafalgar, and the Victory of Lord Nelson over the Combined French and Spanish Fleets,&quot;</em> 1805 1833 (Tate, London). Stanfield may have depicted the Temeraire, illuminated in the foreground and flying the British flag.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ambiguity was on Turner&rsquo;s mind when he began work on his painting, whose full title is&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up</em>,<em> 1838</em>. He was familiar with the namesake ship, HMS Temeraire, as were all Britons of the day. Temeraire was the hero of the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where Napoleon&#39;s forces were defeated, and which secured British naval dominance for the next century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the late 1830s, however, Temeraire was no longer relevant. After retiring from service in 1812 she was converted into a hulk, a ship that can float but not actually sail. She spent time as a prison ship, housing ship, and storage depot before she was finally decommissioned in 1838 and sent up the River Thames to a shipyard in London to be broken into scrap materials. That trip on the Thames was witnessed by Turner, who used it as inspiration for his famous painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Clash of Technology</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For many Britons, Temeraire was a powerful reminder of their nation&rsquo;s long history of military success and a living connection to the heroes of the Napoleonic Wars. Its disassembly signaled the end of an historical era. Turner celebrates Temeraire&rsquo;s heroic past, and he also depicts a technological change which had already begun to affect modern-day life in a more profound way than any battle.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rather than placing Temeraire in the middle of his canvas, Turner paints the warship near the left edge of the canvas. He uses shades of white, grey, and brown for the boat, making it look almost like a ghost ship. The mighty warship is being pulled along by a tiny black tugboat, whose steam engine is more than strong enough to control its larger counterpart. Turner transforms the scene into an allegory about how the new steam power of the Industrial Revolution quickly replaced history and tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Believe it or not, tugboats were so new that there wasn&rsquo;t even a word for what the little ship was doing to Temeraire. According to the&nbsp;Oxford English Dictionary, Turner&rsquo;s title for his painting is the first ever recorded use of the word &ldquo;tugged&rdquo; to describe a steamship pulling another boat.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to the inventive title, Turner included in the exhibition catalog the following lines of text, which he modified from a poem by Thomas Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ye Mariners of England&rdquo;:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The flag which braved the battle and the breeze<br />\n"
"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No long owns her</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This was literally true: Temeraire flies a white flag instead of the British flag, indicating it has been sold by the military to a private company. Furthermore, the poem acknowledges that the ship now has a different function. Temeraire used to be a warship, but no more.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Like Donatello&#39;s <em>St. Mark</em> from Orsanmichele in Florence, he stands naturally, in contrapposto, with his weight on his left leg, and his right knee bent. The apostles (Christ&#39;s followers) look worried and anxiously watch to see what will happen.

"<p>Look down at the feet&mdash;how the light travels through the figures, and is stopped when it encounters the figures.

Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours&quot; (Matthew 17:27).&nbsp;Christ performed a miracle&mdash;and the apostles have the money to pay the tax collector.&nbsp;In the center of the fresco (scene 1), we see the tax collector demanding the money, and Christ instructing Peter. On the far left (scene 2), we see Peter kneeling down and retreiving the&nbsp;money from the mouth of a fish, and on the far right (scene 3), St. Peter pays the tax collector.&nbsp;In the fresco, the tax collector appears twice, and St. Peter appears three times (you can find them easily if you look for their clothing).&nbsp;</p>\n"

Like Donatello&#39;s <em>St. Mark</em> from Orsanmichele in Florence, he stands naturally, in contrapposto, with his weight on his left leg, and his right knee bent. The apostles (Christ&#39;s followers) look worried and anxiously watch to see what will happen.

"<h3>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture?&quot;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture? The style is a mixture of Moorish, Tartar, Gothic, and Chinese and all in stone and iron. It is a whim which has already cost &pound;700,000, and it is still not ﬁt to live in.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^1</code>&nbsp;Such was the verdict of the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich on the eclectic, exotic and sensuous Royal Pavilion at Brighton.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While not all the contemporary reactions to the Pavilion were critical,&nbsp;John Evans, for example, admired it for both its &quot;beauty&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;grandeur,&quot;​<code class=\"latex\">^2</code>​&nbsp;it was a building which provoked a predominantly critical response in Regency England (in political terms the period from 1811 to 1820 when George, Prince of Wales&mdash;future George IV&mdash;ruled in place of his ailing father George III; and in cultural terms up until the death of George IV in 1830).&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;New Brighton Guide</em>&nbsp;called it a&nbsp;&quot;masterpiece of bad taste&quot;&nbsp;while the&nbsp;Comtesse de Boigne declared it a&nbsp;&quot;mad-house.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^3</code>&nbsp;And when Queen Victoria first visited the Royal Pavilion in 1837, she noted,&nbsp;&quot;The Pavilion is a strange, odd, Chinese looking place, both outside and inside.

"<h3>The patron: the Prince Regent</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ostensible aesthetic randomness of the Pavilion is best comprehended as the material expression of the profligate and rebellious life of its extraordinary benefactor, the Prince Regent, the future George IV, undoubtedly the greatest royal patron of the arts since King Charles I. A man of easy wit and charm, as well as political indolence and questionable morals, the Prince was the touchstone of style for the fashion-conscious Georgian elite of the day. He first visited the seaside resort of Brighton in 1783 to benefit from its reputedly medicinal waters. Captivated by the picturesque promise of the area, the Prince purchased a &quot;superior farmhouse&quot;&nbsp;in 1786 and engaged the royal architect Henry Holland to convert this modest building into a Neo-classical &quot;marine pavilion&quot;&nbsp;fit for a royal personage at play. Under the influence of the Prince Regent, William Porden, Nash&rsquo;s assistant, added a large stables and riding school in the Indian-style which would be the decorative prototype for the &quot;Oriental&quot;&nbsp;incarnation of the Royal Pavilion by its&nbsp;principal architect, John Nash.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The architect: John Nash</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>John Nash was the perfect professional partner for the Pavilion&rsquo;s colorful patron. Subsequently criticised for an overly fashionable&nbsp;and reckless approach to architectural practice, and a resultant lack of purity in the finished product, Nash had planned Regent&rsquo;s Street and Regent&rsquo;s Park in London as a celebration of the rise of the new consumer classes.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Nash&rsquo;s vision for Brighton was informed by the Prince&rsquo;s aesthetic sensibilities and colorful personality and the architect&rsquo;s own experiences of the Picturesque (the beauty inherent in unspoilt nature, as first outlined by the artist William Gilpin), as well as the aquatints of &quot;hindoo&quot;&nbsp;architecture which appeared in the six-volume <em>Oriental Scenery</em> by the landscape painters Thomas and William Daniell at the end of the 18th century. The result was the so-called &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style, comprised of an assortment of architectural and design forms and motifs taken from Britain&rsquo;s colonial experience of the &quot;Orient.&quot;<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Without denying the central agency of both the bold-thinking Nash and fashion-conscious Prince Regent in the design of the Royal Pavilion, the range and variety of architectural styles should be viewed within the context of a&nbsp;wider cultural tradition just then emerging. This exotic mad-house was a response to the early&nbsp;British Empire and its&nbsp;East India Company (a trading company established in 1600 with a&nbsp;fleet of ships and an army&nbsp;200,000 strong)&nbsp;that facillitated the rule of&nbsp;the Indian sub-continent for some two-hundred years and&nbsp;which&nbsp;shaped the British Empire.&nbsp;Here was trade from the East, a rich complex of cultural interchange, and a fascination for the &quot;Orient&quot;&nbsp;in its widest, and loosest, colonial meaning. As the architectural historian Ian Sutton has written, in the nineteenth-century, &quot;Both&nbsp;[architects] and their patrons were assailed by new temptations which they found difficult to resist.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^5</code></p>\n"

"<p>Both buildings pre-date the Pavilion. Moreover, juxtaposing a culturally alien interior to the exterior was not a new idea, and was in some sense&nbsp;a colonial interpretation of the cultures of the lands of Empire. Henry Holland&#39;s French Neo-classical Carlton House,&nbsp;1783&ndash;96&nbsp;in London, for example, boasted a fine Chinese drawing room. As such, Brighton Pavilion could be seen as the culmination of years of experimentation, rather than a one-off, stand-alone enterprise.<br />\n"

"<p>What does mark Brighton Pavilion out from the above examples, however, is its fundamental expression of Regency England Romanticism derived from the world of letters. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&rsquo;s opium-fuelled poem &quot;Kubla Khan,&quot; a classic of Romantic literature, published in 1816, famously speaks of the &quot;stately pleasure-dome&quot;&nbsp;of the Mongol ruler. One of the confidants of the Prince Regent was William Beckford, notorious hedonist and author of <em>Vathek: An Arabian Tale</em> (1786), whose earlier story of the outrageous ninth Caliph of Abassides was inspired by both<em> The Arabian Knights</em> and Horace Walpole&rsquo;s <em>The Castle of Oltranto</em> (1764), the latter being the novel that ushered in the Gothic genre in English literature. Indeed, the only true architectural pre-cursor to the Pavilion in this Romantic Gothic tradition is probably Walpole&rsquo;s own <em>Strawberry Hill</em> (see image below), an early example of Gothic Revival architecture, which applies &quot;Gothick&quot;&nbsp;forms and motifs in a similarly imaginative way as the Pavilion.<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Architecturally, the &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior owes much to C.P. Cockerell&rsquo;s Sezincote; however, there is in reality a significant difference which speaks of the changing fashions and the further development of exotic eclecticism in this period. Sezincote is hybridic: it retains a Neo-classical facade (the windows and bays), whilst sporting a turquoise onion-shaped Mughul dome and minarets, typical of Islamic architecture of the Indian sub-continent, such as the Taj Mahal, and features a Hindu-inspired garden, including a temple.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Pavilion&#39;s exterior, on the other hand, is more uniformly Mugul-flavored, albeit shot through with a generic sense of the &quot;Orient&quot;: namely&nbsp;the arabesque profusion of ten domes and ten minarets, supported by a cast iron frame, and the vertical thrust of the building, giving it a sense of lightness and airiness, an almost dream-like temporary tent-like quality, in opposition to the permanent horizontal-axised stout square-blockedness of Sezincote.<br />\n"

The Entrance Hall (see image below), for instance, is symmetrically arranged, as per the Neo-classical; while the Long Gallery (see image above) contains a multitude of generic Chinese/Asian features (&quot;Chinoiserie&quot;), including the hexagonal lanterns, the silk tassels and the motif of bamboo and birds on the wallpaper, the work of interior decorator Frederick Crace.</p>\n"

"<h3>Making sense of a &lsquo;mad-house&rsquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Royal Pavilion at Brighton in all its apparent kaleidoscopic silliness, brashness, vitality, phantasamagoric contradictions and oppositions, references, and tries&mdash;though not always succeeds&mdash;to respond to the tastes of a new fashionable elite at home and to make sense (or not) of a new world of empire abroad. Indeed, in all its range and variety, as well as in its playful eccentricities, it is quite possibly the ultimate architectural manifestation of early nineteenth-century eclecticism, as well as being the material personification of a powerful Regency personality and his private architect. The history of architecture in Britain is all the richer as a result.</p>\n"

"<h3>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture?&quot;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture? The style is a mixture of Moorish, Tartar, Gothic, and Chinese and all in stone and iron. It is a whim which has already cost &pound;700,000, and it is still not ﬁt to live in.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^1</code>&nbsp;Such was the verdict of the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich on the eclectic, exotic and sensuous Royal Pavilion at Brighton.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While not all the contemporary reactions to the Pavilion were critical,&nbsp;John Evans, for example, admired it for both its &quot;beauty&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;grandeur,&quot;​<code class=\"latex\">^2</code>​&nbsp;it was a building which provoked a predominantly critical response in Regency England (in political terms the period from 1811 to 1820 when George, Prince of Wales&mdash;future George IV&mdash;ruled in place of his ailing father George III; and in cultural terms up until the death of George IV in 1830).&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;New Brighton Guide</em>&nbsp;called it a&nbsp;&quot;masterpiece of bad taste&quot;&nbsp;while the&nbsp;Comtesse de Boigne declared it a&nbsp;&quot;mad-house.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^3</code>&nbsp;And when Queen Victoria first visited the Royal Pavilion in 1837, she noted,&nbsp;&quot;The Pavilion is a strange, odd, Chinese looking place, both outside and inside. Most of the rooms are low, and I can see a morsel of the sea, from one of my sitting room windows.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^4</code></p>\n"

"<h3>The patron: the Prince Regent</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ostensible aesthetic randomness of the Pavilion is best comprehended as the material expression of the profligate and rebellious life of its extraordinary benefactor, the Prince Regent, the future George IV, undoubtedly the greatest royal patron of the arts since King Charles I. A man of easy wit and charm, as well as political indolence and questionable morals, the Prince was the touchstone of style for the fashion-conscious Georgian elite of the day. He first visited the seaside resort of Brighton in 1783 to benefit from its reputedly medicinal waters. Captivated by the picturesque promise of the area, the Prince purchased a &quot;superior farmhouse&quot;&nbsp;in 1786 and engaged the royal architect Henry Holland to convert this modest building into a Neo-classical &quot;marine pavilion&quot;&nbsp;fit for a royal personage at play. Under the influence of the Prince Regent, William Porden, Nash&rsquo;s assistant, added a large stables and riding school in the Indian-style which would be the decorative prototype for the &quot;Oriental&quot;&nbsp;incarnation of the Royal Pavilion by its&nbsp;principal architect, John Nash.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The architect: John Nash</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>John Nash was the perfect professional partner for the Pavilion&rsquo;s colorful patron. Subsequently criticised for an overly fashionable&nbsp;and reckless approach to architectural practice, and a resultant lack of purity in the finished product, Nash had planned Regent&rsquo;s Street and Regent&rsquo;s Park in London as a celebration of the rise of the new consumer classes.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Nash&rsquo;s vision for Brighton was informed by the Prince&rsquo;s aesthetic sensibilities and colorful personality and the architect&rsquo;s own experiences of the Picturesque (the beauty inherent in unspoilt nature, as first outlined by the artist William Gilpin), as well as the aquatints of &quot;hindoo&quot;&nbsp;architecture which appeared in the six-volume <em>Oriental Scenery</em> by the landscape painters Thomas and William Daniell at the end of the 18th century. The result was the so-called &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style, comprised of an assortment of architectural and design forms and motifs taken from Britain&rsquo;s colonial experience of the &quot;Orient.&quot;<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Without denying the central agency of both the bold-thinking Nash and fashion-conscious Prince Regent in the design of the Royal Pavilion, the range and variety of architectural styles should be viewed within the context of a&nbsp;wider cultural tradition just then emerging. This exotic mad-house was a response to the early&nbsp;British Empire and its&nbsp;East India Company (a trading company established in 1600 with a&nbsp;fleet of ships and an army&nbsp;200,000 strong)&nbsp;that facillitated the rule of&nbsp;the Indian sub-continent for some two-hundred years and&nbsp;which&nbsp;shaped the British Empire.&nbsp;Here was trade from the East, a rich complex of cultural interchange, and a fascination for the &quot;Orient&quot;&nbsp;in its widest, and loosest, colonial meaning. As the architectural historian Ian Sutton has written, in the nineteenth-century, &quot;Both&nbsp;[architects] and their patrons were assailed by new temptations which they found difficult to resist.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^5</code></p>\n"

"<p>Both buildings pre-date the Pavilion. Moreover, juxtaposing a culturally alien interior to the exterior was not a new idea, and was in some sense&nbsp;a colonial interpretation of the cultures of the lands of Empire. Henry Holland&#39;s French Neo-classical Carlton House,&nbsp;1783&ndash;96&nbsp;in London, for example, boasted a fine Chinese drawing room. As such, Brighton Pavilion could be seen as the culmination of years of experimentation, rather than a one-off, stand-alone enterprise.<br />\n"

"<p>What does mark Brighton Pavilion out from the above examples, however, is its fundamental expression of Regency England Romanticism derived from the world of letters. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&rsquo;s opium-fuelled poem &quot;Kubla Khan,&quot; a classic of Romantic literature, published in 1816, famously speaks of the &quot;stately pleasure-dome&quot;&nbsp;of the Mongol ruler. One of the confidants of the Prince Regent was William Beckford, notorious hedonist and author of <em>Vathek: An Arabian Tale</em> (1786), whose earlier story of the outrageous ninth Caliph of Abassides was inspired by both<em> The Arabian Knights</em> and Horace Walpole&rsquo;s <em>The Castle of Oltranto</em> (1764), the latter being the novel that ushered in the Gothic genre in English literature. Indeed, the only true architectural pre-cursor to the Pavilion in this Romantic Gothic tradition is probably Walpole&rsquo;s own <em>Strawberry Hill</em> (see image below), an early example of Gothic Revival architecture, which applies &quot;Gothick&quot;&nbsp;forms and motifs in a similarly imaginative way as the Pavilion.<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Architecturally, the &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior owes much to C.P. Cockerell&rsquo;s Sezincote; however, there is in reality a significant difference which speaks of the changing fashions and the further development of exotic eclecticism in this period. Sezincote is hybridic: it retains a Neo-classical facade (the windows and bays), whilst sporting a turquoise onion-shaped Mughul dome and minarets, typical of Islamic architecture of the Indian sub-continent, such as the Taj Mahal, and features a Hindu-inspired garden, including a temple.</p>\n"

"&copy; British Library Board</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Pavilion&#39;s exterior, on the other hand, is more uniformly Mugul-flavored, albeit shot through with a generic sense of the &quot;Orient&quot;: namely&nbsp;the arabesque profusion of ten domes and ten minarets, supported by a cast iron frame, and the vertical thrust of the building, giving it a sense of lightness and airiness, an almost dream-like temporary tent-like quality, in opposition to the permanent horizontal-axised stout square-blockedness of Sezincote.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The &quot;Chinese&quot;&nbsp;interior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As for the interior of the Pavilion, while England&rsquo;s curiosity for Chinese culture pre-dates that of its interest in Indian civilization by almost a century, the former&rsquo;s application to the inside of Nash&rsquo;s building is complex, for we have in fact the Neo-classical, Chinese and Gothic at work together. The Entrance Hall (see image below), for instance, is symmetrically arranged, as per the Neo-classical; while the Long Gallery (see image above) contains a multitude of generic Chinese/Asian features (&quot;Chinoiserie&quot;), including the hexagonal lanterns, the silk tassels and the motif of bamboo and birds on the wallpaper, the work of interior decorator Frederick Crace.</p>\n"

"<h3>Making sense of a &lsquo;mad-house&rsquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Royal Pavilion at Brighton in all its apparent kaleidoscopic silliness, brashness, vitality, phantasamagoric contradictions and oppositions, references, and tries&mdash;though not always succeeds&mdash;to respond to the tastes of a new fashionable elite at home and to make sense (or not) of a new world of empire abroad. Indeed, in all its range and variety, as well as in its playful eccentricities, it is quite possibly the ultimate architectural manifestation of early nineteenth-century eclecticism, as well as being the material personification of a powerful Regency personality and his private architect. The history of architecture in Britain is all the richer as a result.</p>\n"

"<p>A key idea of the Age of Enlightenment&mdash;that empirical observation grounded in science and reason could best advance society&mdash;is expressed by the faces of the individuals in Joseph Wright of Derby&rsquo;s <em>A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Age of Enlightenment</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wright&rsquo;s painting encapsulates in one moment the Enlightenment, a philosophical shift in the eighteenth century away from traditional religious models of the universe and toward an empirical, scientific approach. It is important to note the term given this new way of thinking. &ldquo;Enlightenment&rdquo; indicates an active process, undertaken by an individual by group.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The age of Enlightenment is most closely associated with scientists and inventors, but writers and artists also played major roles. They helped spread enlightenment concepts via the written word and printed image, and inspired others to think rationally about the world in which they lived. The provincial English painter Joseph Wright of Derby became the unofficial artist of the Enlightenment, depicting scientists and philosophers in ways previously reserved for Biblical heroes and Greek gods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Joseph Wright of Derby</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Joseph Wright of Derby was born in the town of Derby in central England, and save for short stints in Liverpool and London, lived in that city his entire life. He was known even during his lifetime as Joseph Wright of Derby, to distinguish him from another artist of the same name. Even though Wright of Derby was the more talented of the two, he was stuck with the geographical identifier on his name.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other than Thomas Gainsborough, who spent much of his career in the high-society resort town of Bath, Wright was the most prominent English painter of the eighteenth century to spend the majority of his career outside of London. Operating without the constraints of the mainstream London art world, Wright was free to explore a general interest in science with his friends, a group that included Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles) and other members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, an informal learned society which met to discuss scientific topics of the day.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wright was known for his deft depiction of the contrasts between light and dark, also known as chiaroscuro, and his unflinching portrayal of the true personalities of his subjects. This trait caused his downfall when he attempted to work as a portraitist&mdash;few wanted a portrait, warts and all.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Intensity of Scientific Discovery</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 1760s Wright began to explore the traditional boundaries of various genres of painting. According to the French academies of art, the highest genre of painting was history painting, which depicted Biblical or classical subjects to demonstrate a moral lesson. This high regard for history panting was adopted by the British&mdash;Benjamin West&rsquo;s <em>The Death of General Wolfe</em> is a prominent example.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Wright took this noble, aggrandizing method of portraying events and applied it to a composition showing a contemporary subject in <em>A Philosopher Lecturing at the Orrery</em>. Rather than a moral of leadership or heroism, this painting&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral&rdquo; is the pursuit of scientific knowledge. With its collection of non-idealized men, women, boys, and girls informally arranged in a small physical space around a central organizing point, Wright&rsquo;s painting mimics the compositional structure of a conversation piece (an informal group portrait) like Zoffany&#39;s <em>Gore Family</em> (above), but with the dramatic lighting and scale expected from a major religious scene.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In effect, <em>A Philosopher Lecturing at the Orrery </em>does depict a moment of religious epiphany. Much like the central figure in Caravaggio&rsquo;s<em> Calling of Saint Matthew </em>(below), the figures listening to the philosopher&rsquo;s lecture in Wright&rsquo;s painting are experiencing conversion...to science.</p>\n"

"<p>Petra is often seen in isolation; in fact, it was one of many Nabataean sites; the Nabataean lands stretched from the Sinai and Negev in the west, as far north as Damascus at one point, and as far south as Egra, modern-day Madain Saleh, in Northern Saudi Arabia, which also had numerous rock-cut tombs, amongst others. At Egra an inscription attests to the presence of a Roman Legion at the site, marking the city as the southern most boundary of the Roman Empire in the Antonine Era. Khirbet et-Tannur was a major sanctuary in central Jordan; many of its reliefs are in the Cincinnati Museum of Art today.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Nabataeans took an active role in their architectural and artistic creations, drawing upon the artistic vocabulary of the Hellenistic world and the ancient Near East. Rather than slavishly copying either one of these traditions, the Nabataeans actively selected and adopted certain elements for their tombs, dining pavilions, and temples to suit their needs and purposes, on both the group and individual level. Indeed, the Treasury and the Monastery could only have been conceived of and executed in Petra.</p>\n"

"<p>Petra is often seen in isolation; in fact, it was one of many Nabataean sites; the Nabataean lands stretched from the Sinai and Negev in the west, as far north as Damascus at one point, and as far south as Egra, modern-day Madain Saleh, in Northern Saudi Arabia, which also had numerous rock-cut tombs, amongst others. At Egra an inscription attests to the presence of a Roman Legion at the site, marking the city as the southern most boundary of the Roman Empire in the Antonine Era. Khirbet et-Tannur was a major sanctuary in central Jordan; many of its reliefs are in the Cincinnati Museum of Art today.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Nabataeans took an active role in their architectural and artistic creations, drawing upon the artistic vocabulary of the Hellenistic world and the ancient Near East. Rather than slavishly copying either one of these traditions, the Nabataeans actively selected and adopted certain elements for their tombs, dining pavilions, and temples to suit their needs and purposes, on both the group and individual level. Indeed, the Treasury and the Monastery could only have been conceived of and executed in Petra.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The way of the flesh and the way of the spirit</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Dutch painter Pieter Aertsen, who worked for many years in Antwerp, was later renowned for his life-size market scenes with exuberant still life elements. Many scholars have commented on the bold originality of Aertsen&rsquo;s compositions, and rightly so. In the sixteenth century, religious or mythological scenes usually occupied pride of place in works of art, while everyday objects were considered mere accessories. In this and other&nbsp;roughly contemporary works like <em>Christ in the House of Mary and Martha</em>&nbsp;(below), Aertsen has deliberately reversed this formula. He gave all the attention to the accessories, which seem to spill out of the picture and into the viewer&rsquo;s own space.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Christ with Mary and Martha, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ccc4b4ff34ac21f9c91e6a330370a3d1f5382ac0.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>Christ in the House of&nbsp;Mary and Martha</em>, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen certainly seems to have been the first to foreground meat in a prestigious, costly oil painting on a monumental size. However, he may also have been inspired to upend traditional hierarchies of subject matter (giving most of the attention to the still-life elements) by the painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden&#39;s <em>Ecce homo </em>scene<em>&nbsp;</em>(<em>Ecce homo</em>&nbsp;means &quot;behold the man&quot; and refers to&nbsp;Pontius Pilate presenting&nbsp;the beaten Christ crowned with&nbsp;thorns before his crucifixion). Leyden, in <em>Christ Presented the People</em> (below),&nbsp;shows a great market square with a crowd in the foreground, while Christ himself has been relegated to the background.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Lucas van Leyden, Christ Presented to the People, c. 1510, copperplate engraving, 28.8 x 45.2 cm (The British Museum)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7642ddf09bd1a450b93c9edebf0e569e11ee9cd8.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Lucas van Leyden, <em>Christ Presented to the People,</em> c. 1510, copperplate engraving, 28.8 x 45.2 cm (The British Museum)</span></span><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Crossed herring (detail), Pieter Aertsen, A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b352bceece09f8bfc4234e556d9bc96717e3f106.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Crossed herring (detail), Pieter Aertsen, <em>A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms</em>, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)</span></span>This&nbsp;may be a comment on the arduous nature of spirituality: those who truly seek enlightenment must look hard, and turn their attention away from the things of this world. And indeed, in Aertsen&rsquo;s picture, the crossed herring on a pewter plate just above the ox&rsquo;s head&mdash;fish was associated with Lent, a period when the faithful abstained from meat&mdash;seem to point in the direction of the holy scene in the background, beyond the meat.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other scholars have suggested that Aertsen&rsquo;s inversion of traditional hierarchies was inspired by sources from classical antiquity&mdash;though perhaps equally moralizing. The Roman satirist Juvenal, for example, chastised the lovers of lavish meals in his eleventh satire, lambasting their fondness for &ldquo;stinking meat shops&rdquo; instead of plain, wholesome food. Closer to Aertsen&rsquo;s own time, the philosopher Desiderius Erasmus&nbsp;used irony to make a point: undesirable behavior is heaped with praise&nbsp;to throw its negative aspects into sharp relief, while the reader is treated to a good laugh. Erasmus does this to great effect in <em>In Praise of Folly </em>(1511), a book that Aertsen and his contemporaries may very well have read.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The art of rendering well</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Market Woman with Vegetable Stall, 1567, oil on wood (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/649343f96e60dd9c50082933c54d82dbec68fb5f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, Market <em>Woman with Vegetable Stall</em>, 1567, oil on wood (Gem&auml;ldegalerie, Berlin)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen&rsquo;s bold move can also be seen in light of his artistic context. Antwerp in the mid-sixteenth century was one of the greatest centers of mercantile trade at the time: populous, prosperous, and booming.&nbsp;It was the second largest city in northern Europe&mdash;smaller than Paris but bigger than London&mdash;and arguably also the wealthiest. Merchants came from <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Jan Brueghel the Elder, Flowers in a Wooden Vessel, 1568, oil on wood, 98 x 73 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb2a49dd484a23c0a9a95993eea605e50e079233.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Jan Brueghel the Elder, <em>Flowers in a Wooden Vessel</em>, 1568, oil on wood, 98 x 73 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span>around the world to deal in spices, staple goods, finance, and especially luxury goods like glass, fine textiles, precious furnishings, and works of art. The number of artists attracted to this concentration of wealth was considerable, and this in turn encouraged specialization, a situation that may also have encouraged Aertsen to flaunt his skill in painting lifelike elements such as fruit, vegetables, cheese, and meat in the market scenes for which he is now famous (see the image above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like so many other specialties we take for granted today: landscapes, flower pieces, scenes from everyday life, etc. market scenes were just beginning to emerge as subjects in their own right, independent of paintings that depicted mythological or religious scenes&mdash;which, by the way, Aertsen also painted in considerable numbers (see below), though not all of them survived the waves of iconoclasm (the destruction of images) that swept across northern Europe in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, The Adoration of the Magi, c. 1560, oil on panel, 167.5 x 180 cm (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bf25ca6e7e653517b09194e1e1de3df6f4a5256c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>The Adoration of the Magi</em>, c. 1560, oil on panel, 167.5 x 180 cm (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)</span></span></p>\n"

"<h3>Topical concerns</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Two hands—symbol of Antwerp (detail), Pieter Aertsen, A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46c74eeba74c0c1bebeeff7767fd2c74df60173b.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Two hands&mdash;symbol of Antwerp (detail), Pieter Aertsen, <em>A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms</em>, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)</span></span>Aertsen&rsquo;s originality and painterly skill would have been sufficient to charm an international connoisseur among Antwerp&rsquo;s wealthy merchant community, who came from countries as diverse as Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Poland, Germany, and of course Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But for those familiar with Antwerp&rsquo;s tangled local politics, there are some highly specific messages embedded in this composition that would have been legible only to them. In the upper left-hand corner is a small representation of&nbsp;two hands&mdash;the symbol of the city of Antwerp&mdash;and chalked on the post next to it are symbols typical of guild marks belonging to specific individuals, though their identity remains a mystery.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Present-day view of the Vleeshuis, or Butchers’ Hall, Antwerp, photo: Ckiki lwai (CC BY-SA 3.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0c1982d032547526498744d72eca5e544c713c2f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Present-day view of the <em>Vleeshuis</em>, or Butchers&rsquo; Hall, Antwerp, photo: <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Het_Vleeshuis_(the_butchers_guild_house).jpg\">Ckiki lwai </a>(CC BY-SA 3.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Butchers&rsquo; Guild in Antwerp was a very powerful institution that enjoyed the support of Emperor Charles V himself. It was one of the few guilds with a written charter, and succeeded in having its profession closed to outsiders: there could only be sixty-two officially recognized butchers in the city at any given time, and when a butcher passed away his post would go to his son or other close male relative. Anyone who wanted to buy meat in Antwerp had to buy it from the <em>Vleeshuis</em>, or &ldquo;Meat Hall,&rdquo; an imposing building near the banks of the River Scheldt that was rivaled as a landmark only by the Church of Our Lady (now the cathedral of Antwerp), truly a sign of the guild&rsquo;s power. Nevertheless, the butchers&rsquo; influence was coming under increasing attack in 1551: butchers from outside the city had banded together to fight what they perceived as an unfair trade monopoly. They filed a lawsuit that was first overturned, then upheld, then appealed by the Butchers&rsquo; Guild in the imperial courts&mdash;and the results were still pending when Aertsen painted his striking panel. Meat was a hot item indeed!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Sign (detail), Pieter Aertsen, A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/424d6ee48de8d0d7cbbad3cb88fdf2c856854bf8.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sign (detail), Pieter Aertsen, <em>A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms</em>, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)</span></span>But there is more. At the upper right, posted on top of the meat stall, is a small sign in Dutch &nbsp;that, when translated, reads: &ldquo;Land for sale out back: 154 rods, either by the piece or all at once.&rdquo; This text refers to an actual sale of land that took place in 1551, and a controversial one at that. It must have been important to the picture&rsquo;s original meaning, because the sign appears in all four, almost identical versions of the <em>Meat Stall</em> that Aertsen painted. To make a long story short, the city of Antwerp decided to develop what was then the southeast side of town. Land being in short supply, the city council forced the prestigious order of Augustinian nuns who ran the St. Elisabeth&rsquo;s hospital&nbsp;to sell their property at a loss. But the city bought too much acreage, so the surplus was sold to one Gillis van Schoonbeke, a notorious real estate developer whose activities were so unpopular that they even caused riots. At one point imperial troops had to be called in to stop the violence.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Given this background, the painting with its layered messages&mdash;all of which warn against greed and excess&mdash;must have seemed emblematic of the rapid social changes overtaking the city, which experienced unprecedented growth thanks to its booming international trade. Traditional groups and values, such as the charitable nuns and their inviolable property, or the venerable butchers and their hereditary rights, were under fire from powerful, wealthy entrepreneurs and the city&rsquo;s desire for economic growth, a matter of concern for all citizens.&nbsp;</p>\n"

A great carcass hangs in the same room, and a butcher (we recognize him as such thanks to his red coat, which in Antwerp could only be worn by guild members) appears to be adding water to the wine for his guests. But why would an artist depict meat at all, let alone in such an unsavory way and in combination with a religious scene?&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The way of the flesh and the way of the spirit</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Dutch painter Pieter Aertsen, who worked for many years in Antwerp, was later renowned for his life-size market scenes with exuberant still life elements. Many scholars have commented on the bold originality of Aertsen&rsquo;s compositions, and rightly so. In the sixteenth century, religious or mythological scenes usually occupied pride of place in works of art, while everyday objects were considered mere accessories. In this and other&nbsp;roughly contemporary works like <em>Christ in the House of Mary and Martha</em>&nbsp;(below), Aertsen has deliberately reversed this formula. He gave all the attention to the accessories, which seem to spill out of the picture and into the viewer&rsquo;s own space.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Christ with Mary and Martha, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ccc4b4ff34ac21f9c91e6a330370a3d1f5382ac0.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>Christ in the House of&nbsp;Mary and Martha</em>, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen certainly seems to have been the first to foreground meat in a prestigious, costly oil painting on a monumental size. However, he may also have been inspired to upend traditional hierarchies of subject matter (giving most of the attention to the still-life elements) by the painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden&#39;s <em>Ecce homo </em>scene<em>&nbsp;</em>(<em>Ecce homo</em>&nbsp;means &quot;behold the man&quot; and refers to&nbsp;Pontius Pilate presenting&nbsp;the beaten Christ crowned with&nbsp;thorns before his crucifixion). Leyden, in <em>Christ Presented the People</em> (below),&nbsp;shows a great market square with a crowd in the foreground, while Christ himself has been relegated to the background.</p>\n"

And indeed, in Aertsen&rsquo;s picture, the crossed herring on a pewter plate just above the ox&rsquo;s head&mdash;fish was associated with Lent, a period when the faithful abstained from meat&mdash;seem to point in the direction of the holy scene in the background, beyond the meat.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other scholars have suggested that Aertsen&rsquo;s inversion of traditional hierarchies was inspired by sources from classical antiquity&mdash;though perhaps equally moralizing. The Roman satirist Juvenal, for example, chastised the lovers of lavish meals in his eleventh satire, lambasting their fondness for &ldquo;stinking meat shops&rdquo; instead of plain, wholesome food. Closer to Aertsen&rsquo;s own time, the philosopher Desiderius Erasmus&nbsp;used irony to make a point: undesirable behavior is heaped with praise&nbsp;to throw its negative aspects into sharp relief, while the reader is treated to a good laugh. Erasmus does this to great effect in <em>In Praise of Folly </em>(1511), a book that Aertsen and his contemporaries may very well have read.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The art of rendering well</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Market Woman with Vegetable Stall, 1567, oil on wood (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/649343f96e60dd9c50082933c54d82dbec68fb5f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, Market <em>Woman with Vegetable Stall</em>, 1567, oil on wood (Gem&auml;ldegalerie, Berlin)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen&rsquo;s bold move can also be seen in light of his artistic context. Antwerp in the mid-sixteenth century was one of the greatest centers of mercantile trade at the time: populous, prosperous, and booming.&nbsp;It was the second largest city in northern Europe&mdash;smaller than Paris but bigger than London&mdash;and arguably also the wealthiest. Merchants came from <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Jan Brueghel the Elder, Flowers in a Wooden Vessel, 1568, oil on wood, 98 x 73 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb2a49dd484a23c0a9a95993eea605e50e079233.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Jan Brueghel the Elder, <em>Flowers in a Wooden Vessel</em>, 1568, oil on wood, 98 x 73 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span>around the world to deal in spices, staple goods, finance, and especially luxury goods like glass, fine textiles, precious furnishings, and works of art. The number of artists attracted to this concentration of wealth was considerable, and this in turn encouraged specialization, a situation that may also have encouraged Aertsen to flaunt his skill in painting lifelike elements such as fruit, vegetables, cheese, and meat in the market scenes for which he is now famous (see the image above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like so many other specialties we take for granted today: landscapes, flower pieces, scenes from everyday life, etc. market scenes were just beginning to emerge as subjects in their own right, independent of paintings that depicted mythological or religious scenes&mdash;which, by the way, Aertsen also painted in considerable numbers (see below), though not all of them survived the waves of iconoclasm (the destruction of images) that swept across northern Europe in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, The Adoration of the Magi, c. 1560, oil on panel, 167.5 x 180 cm (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bf25ca6e7e653517b09194e1e1de3df6f4a5256c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>The Adoration of the Magi</em>, c. 1560, oil on panel, 167.5 x 180 cm (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)</span></span></p>\n"

"<h3>Topical concerns</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Two hands—symbol of Antwerp (detail), Pieter Aertsen, A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46c74eeba74c0c1bebeeff7767fd2c74df60173b.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Two hands&mdash;symbol of Antwerp (detail), Pieter Aertsen, <em>A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms</em>, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)</span></span>Aertsen&rsquo;s originality and painterly skill would have been sufficient to charm an international connoisseur among Antwerp&rsquo;s wealthy merchant community, who came from countries as diverse as Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Poland, Germany, and of course Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But for those familiar with Antwerp&rsquo;s tangled local politics, there are some highly specific messages embedded in this composition that would have been legible only to them. In the upper left-hand corner is a small representation of&nbsp;two hands&mdash;the symbol of the city of Antwerp&mdash;and chalked on the post next to it are symbols typical of guild marks belonging to specific individuals, though their identity remains a mystery.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Present-day view of the Vleeshuis, or Butchers’ Hall, Antwerp, photo: Ckiki lwai (CC BY-SA 3.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0c1982d032547526498744d72eca5e544c713c2f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Present-day view of the <em>Vleeshuis</em>, or Butchers&rsquo; Hall, Antwerp, photo: <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Het_Vleeshuis_(the_butchers_guild_house).jpg\">Ckiki lwai </a>(CC BY-SA 3.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Butchers&rsquo; Guild in Antwerp was a very powerful institution that enjoyed the support of Emperor Charles V himself. It was one of the few guilds with a written charter, and succeeded in having its profession closed to outsiders: there could only be sixty-two officially recognized butchers in the city at any given time, and when a butcher passed away his post would go to his son or other close male relative. Anyone who wanted to buy meat in Antwerp had to buy it from the <em>Vleeshuis</em>, or &ldquo;Meat Hall,&rdquo; an imposing building near the banks of the River Scheldt that was rivaled as a landmark only by the Church of Our Lady (now the cathedral of Antwerp), truly a sign of the guild&rsquo;s power. Nevertheless, the butchers&rsquo; influence was coming under increasing attack in 1551: butchers from outside the city had banded together to fight what they perceived as an unfair trade monopoly. They filed a lawsuit that was first overturned, then upheld, then appealed by the Butchers&rsquo; Guild in the imperial courts&mdash;and the results were still pending when Aertsen painted his striking panel. Meat was a hot item indeed!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Sign (detail), Pieter Aertsen, A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/424d6ee48de8d0d7cbbad3cb88fdf2c856854bf8.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sign (detail), Pieter Aertsen, <em>A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms</em>, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)</span></span>But there is more. At the upper right, posted on top of the meat stall, is a small sign in Dutch &nbsp;that, when translated, reads: &ldquo;Land for sale out back: 154 rods, either by the piece or all at once.&rdquo; This text refers to an actual sale of land that took place in 1551, and a controversial one at that. It must have been important to the picture&rsquo;s original meaning, because the sign appears in all four, almost identical versions of the <em>Meat Stall</em> that Aertsen painted. To make a long story short, the city of Antwerp decided to develop what was then the southeast side of town. Land being in short supply, the city council forced the prestigious order of Augustinian nuns who ran the St. Elisabeth&rsquo;s hospital&nbsp;to sell their property at a loss. But the city bought too much acreage, so the surplus was sold to one Gillis van Schoonbeke, a notorious real estate developer whose activities were so unpopular that they even caused riots. At one point imperial troops had to be called in to stop the violence.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Given this background, the painting with its layered messages&mdash;all of which warn against greed and excess&mdash;must have seemed emblematic of the rapid social changes overtaking the city, which experienced unprecedented growth thanks to its booming international trade. Traditional groups and values, such as the charitable nuns and their inviolable property, or the venerable butchers and their hereditary rights, were under fire from powerful, wealthy entrepreneurs and the city&rsquo;s desire for economic growth, a matter of concern for all citizens.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Cupid&#39;s arrow hits its mark</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A young woman in a bejeweled dress with a stiff lace collar gazes confidently out of a simply-framed, bust-length portrait placed at the very center of a large canvas. &nbsp;Her name is Marie de&#39; Medici, daughter of the Grandduke of Tuscany.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Additionally, Marie&rsquo;s hefty dowry eased Henry&rsquo;s large debt to the Medici, major financial backers of his military activities. And, perhaps most importantly, Henry was nearing the age of 50 and had yet to father an heir, putting France&rsquo;s future stability in danger. A fruitful union with Marie was key to this stability.

"In the Pre-Hispanic period (the period before Spanish colonization)&nbsp;the Inka did not have a tradition of portrait painting comparable to that of Europeans (the Inka&nbsp;Empire was on the west coast of South America, and included&nbsp;parts of present day Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia). However, following the Spanish Conquest (c. 1534) they quickly appropriated European painting conventions. For example, the images of Sapa Inkas (the sovereign Inka emperors) in Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala&rsquo;s famed illustrated chronicle <em>El primer nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</em> (<em>The First New Chronicle and Good Government</em>, c. 1615) are among the earliest examples of European-style portraiture executed by an indigenous artist.&nbsp;</p>\n"

He is, though,&nbsp;included in the Brooklyn series&mdash;with an inscription that reads &ldquo;bastard tyrant Atahualpa.&rdquo; The increased scale of his figure in the roundel deviates from the conventions of the other thirteen portraits, such as those of Huayna Capac or Huascar.*</p>\n"

"<p>Atahualpa was the last Sapa Inka before the Spanish Conquest began around 1534. As the inscription on the Brooklyn portrait makes explicit, he was the illegitimate son of Sapa Inka Huayna Capac who&nbsp;died of smallpox in 1528.&nbsp;Although Atahualpa ultimately prevailed in&nbsp;a battle with his elder brother Huascar (born of a different mother) for control of the Inka empire&mdash;the timing of the victory was unfortunate. &nbsp;While the civil war raged, the Spanish conquistador Franciso Pizarro, who had landed in present-day Ecuador on his third expedition to the Americas, made his way southward along the western coast of the continent, pillaging and murdering as he traveled. In November of 1523, Atahualpa was celebrating his victory in the city of Cajamarca awaiting the arrival of his prisoner, his brother&nbsp;Huascar. &nbsp;He had learned of Pizarro&rsquo;s expedition party but believed a retinue of less than two hundred men posed little threat. On November 16 Atahualpa, sumptuously attired, rode into the plaza of Cajamarca atop a luxurious litter (a platform for passengers&nbsp;carried by people)&nbsp;accompanied by high ranking Inka nobles and several thousand guards. &nbsp;He was met by the Dominican friar Vicente de Valverde and an interpreter. &nbsp;After a tense exchange in which Atahualpa threw to the ground a book of Catholic prayers offered to him by Valverde, the friar called out to the Spaniards who had hidden themselves, their mounts and artillery in the buildings surrounding the plaza. Pizarro signaled his men to charge, and in the ambush that followed several thousand Andeans were massacred and Atahualpa was taken prisoner. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In captivity, Atahualpa quickly discovered the Spaniards&rsquo; lust for silver and gold. He offered Pizarro an impressive ransom in exchange for his freedom, promising to fill a room approximately 6.2m x 4.8m to half its height (2.5 meters) with gold objects and the same room twice over with silver objects. For the next eight months, gold and silver streamed into Cajamarca from across the empire. Beginning in June the Spaniards began melting down the cache of treasure and divvying up the spoils. After the ransom had been melted and dispersed&mdash;and in response to mounting pressure among the expedition party&mdash;Pizarro had Atahualpa executed on July 26, 1533, by garroting (a method of execution by which a tightened metal collar results in strangulation). &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Who owned this series?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the colonial period if you visited the home of a powerful <em>cacique</em> (an Indian chieftain or nobleman) you might see royal portraits depicting the succession of Inka kings displayed. Portraits of royal Inka&nbsp;genealogies were especially important in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries&mdash;these aristocratic genealogies were employed by the Inka elite to assert their privileged social status and claim political power in the viceroyalty. &nbsp;Following the Tupac Amaru II rebellion (1780-81), Inkaist imagery (like depictions of the Sapa Inkas)&nbsp;was banned by Spanish colonial authorities who feared that depictions of aristocratic Inka forbearers as well as contemporary Inka nobility would incite subsequent uprisings. Genealogical Inka portraits, such as the Brooklyn series, would have been seen as subversive in this moment. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Essay by Carla Colon</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>*There are two potential sources for the&nbsp;<em>General History</em>&nbsp;engravings upon which the Brooklyn series is based. The first are paintings of Pre-Hispanic Inka rulers commissioned in 1572 by the Viceroy Franciso de Toledo and sent to King Phillip II of Spain. &nbsp;The second is a painting commissioned by Inkas of royal descent in Cuzco which depicted Pre-Hispanic Inka rulers and their descendants. &nbsp;This painting, which was sent to Spain in 1603, served as evidence of the commissioners&rsquo; royal lineage and established their claim to rights as nobility under Spanish law. &nbsp;Unfortunately since neither of the proposed models for the General History engravings exist any more, we are limited to speculation about its original source.</p>\n"

"In the Pre-Hispanic period (the period before Spanish colonization)&nbsp;the Inka did not have a tradition of portrait painting comparable to that of Europeans (the Inka&nbsp;Empire was on the west coast of South America, and included&nbsp;parts of present day Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia). However, following the Spanish Conquest (c. 1534) they quickly appropriated European painting conventions. For example, the images of Sapa Inkas (the sovereign Inka emperors) in Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala&rsquo;s famed illustrated chronicle <em>El primer nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</em> (<em>The First New Chronicle and Good Government</em>, c. 1615) are among the earliest examples of European-style portraiture executed by an indigenous artist.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The history is&nbsp;divided into eight decades, each of which is introduced by a unique, engraved title page. The title page (left) introducing the fifth decade was the model for the Brooklyn series of Inka rulers.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In both the engraving and the painted series, the figures&rsquo; postures and regalia as well as the strategies of representation correspond closely. The Inka kings are shown as half-length figures set in decorative roundels on which are inscribed their names and positions in the line of royal succession. Notably absent from the Herrera engraving is the image of Atahualpa. He is, though,&nbsp;included in the Brooklyn series&mdash;with an inscription that reads &ldquo;bastard tyrant Atahualpa.&rdquo; The increased scale of his figure in the roundel deviates from the conventions of the other thirteen portraits, such as those of Huayna Capac or Huascar.*</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f846dc883757764b7254c734baea2240c0e01272.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Right: <em>Huayna Capac, Twelfth Inka</em>, c. mid-18th century, oil on canvas, 23 1/2 x 21 11/16 inches (Brooklyn Museum of Art); left: <em>Huascar, Thirteenth Inka</em>, c. mid-18th century, oil on canvas, 23 1/2 x 21 11/16 inches (Brooklyn Museum of Art)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Atahualpa was the last Sapa Inka before the Spanish Conquest began around 1534. As the inscription on the Brooklyn portrait makes explicit, he was the illegitimate son of Sapa Inka Huayna Capac who&nbsp;died of smallpox in 1528.&nbsp;Although Atahualpa ultimately prevailed in&nbsp;a battle with his elder brother Huascar (born of a different mother) for control of the Inka empire&mdash;the timing of the victory was unfortunate. &nbsp;While the civil war raged, the Spanish conquistador Franciso Pizarro, who had landed in present-day Ecuador on his third expedition to the Americas, made his way southward along the western coast of the continent, pillaging and murdering as he traveled. In November of 1523, Atahualpa was celebrating his victory in the city of Cajamarca awaiting the arrival of his prisoner, his brother&nbsp;Huascar. &nbsp;He had learned of Pizarro&rsquo;s expedition party but believed a retinue of less than two hundred men posed little threat. On November 16 Atahualpa, sumptuously attired, rode into the plaza of Cajamarca atop a luxurious litter (a platform for passengers&nbsp;carried by people)&nbsp;accompanied by high ranking Inka nobles and several thousand guards. &nbsp;He was met by the Dominican friar Vicente de Valverde and an interpreter. &nbsp;After a tense exchange in which Atahualpa threw to the ground a book of Catholic prayers offered to him by Valverde, the friar called out to the Spaniards who had hidden themselves, their mounts and artillery in the buildings surrounding the plaza. Pizarro signaled his men to charge, and in the ambush that followed several thousand Andeans were massacred and Atahualpa was taken prisoner. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In captivity, Atahualpa quickly discovered the Spaniards&rsquo; lust for silver and gold. He offered Pizarro an impressive ransom in exchange for his freedom, promising to fill a room approximately 6.2m x 4.8m to half its height (2.5 meters) with gold objects and the same room twice over with silver objects. For the next eight months, gold and silver streamed into Cajamarca from across the empire. Beginning in June the Spaniards began melting down the cache of treasure and divvying up the spoils. After the ransom had been melted and dispersed&mdash;and in response to mounting pressure among the expedition party&mdash;Pizarro had Atahualpa executed on July 26, 1533, by garroting (a method of execution by which a tightened metal collar results in strangulation). &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Who owned this series?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the colonial period if you visited the home of a powerful <em>cacique</em> (an Indian chieftain or nobleman) you might see royal portraits depicting the succession of Inka kings displayed. Portraits of royal Inka&nbsp;genealogies were especially important in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries&mdash;these aristocratic genealogies were employed by the Inka elite to assert their privileged social status and claim political power in the viceroyalty. &nbsp;Following the Tupac Amaru II rebellion (1780-81), Inkaist imagery (like depictions of the Sapa Inkas)&nbsp;was banned by Spanish colonial authorities who feared that depictions of aristocratic Inka forbearers as well as contemporary Inka nobility would incite subsequent uprisings. Genealogical Inka portraits, such as the Brooklyn series, would have been seen as subversive in this moment. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Essay by Carla Colon</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>*There are two potential sources for the&nbsp;<em>General History</em>&nbsp;engravings upon which the Brooklyn series is based. The first are paintings of Pre-Hispanic Inka rulers commissioned in 1572 by the Viceroy Franciso de Toledo and sent to King Phillip II of Spain. &nbsp;The second is a painting commissioned by Inkas of royal descent in Cuzco which depicted Pre-Hispanic Inka rulers and their descendants. &nbsp;This painting, which was sent to Spain in 1603, served as evidence of the commissioners&rsquo; royal lineage and established their claim to rights as nobility under Spanish law. &nbsp;Unfortunately since neither of the proposed models for the General History engravings exist any more, we are limited to speculation about its original source.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Three translations of the same decree</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The inscriptions are three translations of the same decree, passed by a council of priests, that affirms the royal cult of the thirteen-year-old Ptolemy V on the first anniversary of his coronation. The decree is inscribed on the stone three times, in hieroglyphic (suitable for a priestly decree), demotic (the native script used for daily purposes), and Greek (the language of the administration). The importance of this to Egyptology is immense.&nbsp;In the early years of the nineteenth century, scholars were able to use the Greek inscription on this stone as the key to deciphering the others.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Opposition to the Ptolemies</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In previous years the family of the Ptolemies had lost control of certain parts of the country. It had taken their armies some time to put down opposition in the Delta, and parts of southern Upper Egypt, particularly Thebes, were not yet back under the government&#39;s control.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before the Ptolemaic era (that is before about 332 B.C.E.), decrees in hieroglyphs such as this were usually set up by the king. It shows how much things had changed from Pharaonic times that the priests, the only people who had kept the knowledge of writing hieroglyphs, were now issuing such decrees. The list of good deeds done by the king for the temples hints at the way in which the support of the priests was ensured.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The end of hieroglyphics</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Soon after the end of the fourth century C.E., when hieroglyphs had gone out of use, the knowledge of how to read and write them disappeared. In the early years of the nineteenth century, some 1400 years later, scholars were able to use the Greek inscription on this stone as the key to decipher them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The discovery</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Thomas Young, an English physicist, was the first to show that some of the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone wrote the sounds of a royal name, that of Ptolemy. The French scholar Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Champollion then realized that hieroglyphs recorded the sound of the Egyptian language and laid the foundations of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian language and culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Soldiers in Napoleon&#39;s army discovered the Rosetta Stone in 1799 while digging the foundations of an addition to a fort near the town of el-Rashid (Rosetta). On Napoleon&#39;s defeat, the stone became the property of the&nbsp;British under the terms of the Treaty of Alexandria (1801) along with other antiquities that the French had found.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Rosetta Stone has been exhibited in the British Museum since 1802, with only one break. Towards the end of the First World War, in 1917, when the Museum was concerned about heavy bombing in London, they moved it to safety along with other, portable, &#39;important&#39; objects.

These ancient people were followed by Archaic hunters from 8000-1000 B.C.E. who exploited the new animal and plant resources of a warming climate, following the end of the ice-age, using specialized tools.&nbsp;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span>After the Archaic period came the Woodland peoples, from about 800 B.C.E., who lived in settled communities, hunting, fishing and gathering and cultivating plants. Large earthworks, such as those of the Ohio Hopewell culture (from about 100 B.C.E. to C.E.&nbsp;600), were created for religious, economic and defensive purposes.</span></p>\n"

European colonization and the expansion of the United States brought diseases and warfare that killed most of the native population. Bison, on which many depended for food, clothing, housing and tools, were hunted almost to extinction by commercial hunters. Further hardship came as many were forced to live in reservations.&nbsp;Continuing conflict culminated in the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 when United States troops massacred hundreds of Lakota after they had surrendered.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today, between two and three million people of native descent live in Canada and the United States of America. They are grouped into more than 1000 bands, tribes or nations all possessing their own oral literatures and histories; their survival and continued vibrancy a testament to the enduring strength of their traditions</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Eastern Woodlands</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The peoples of the expansive woodlands of Eastern America live in a large number of tribes, with related religious and linguistic traditions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people subsisted through hunting, fishing and limited agriculture, trading with and periodically making war on their neighbors. They were the first Native North American societies to experience the arrival of Europeans and despite regular outbreaks of disease and warfare, a significant cultural exchange took place as Europeans learned to live and travel in their New World. Native Americans quickly accessed new technologies and markets, fueling an explosion in trade that had a profound effect on all involved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Plains</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people of the North American Plains were predominantly nomadic, living in large territories roamed by great herds of buffalo.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Early adopters of the horse, they lived in societies governed by profound military and religious traditions which produced richly decorated clothing and weaponry. The Plains peoples fought ferociously to maintain their independence as the European nations of North America spread westwards in the nineteenth century. Eventually, after decades of resistance, most Plains people were forced to live on reservations, where despite documented official efforts to eliminate them, traditional practices and languages have survived.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Southwest</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The peoples of the Southwestern United States have a long tradition of settled life that is reliant on agriculture.&nbsp;Diverse peoples with varied cultural and linguistic traditions, the people of the Southwest have long produced highly decorated pottery, jewelery and textiles. These objects form part of a cultural and technological exchange with Mexican societies to the south which remain central to a thriving market in contemporary art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Northwest coast</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The societies of the Northwest coast of North America developed in relative isolation between the Coastal Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Living in small communities on islands and in fjords, they utilized the huge cedar forests to construct the elaborate heraldic structures now known collectively as totem poles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The enthusiasm for carving stretched far beyond the poles, to encompass all areas of life on the coast and their ornate canoes could travel across hundreds of miles of ocean in search of fish, whales, trade or war. Control of the sea allowed chieftains to amass considerable wealth which they distributed to followers at elaborate feasts known as potlatches.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masking, a performance art practiced widely on the coast, was an integral part of potlatches, where ancestral tales were performed in long houses before the tribe and their guests. Some, such as this example, were designed to transform mid-dance from one form to another, an essential part of Northwest Coast storytelling.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Arctic</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The shores of the North American continent around and to the north of the Arctic circle are inhabited by people speaking related, though distinct, Eskimo-Aleut languages: these are Aleut, Alutiiq, Yup&#39;ik and Inupiaq in Alaska; Siberian Yup&rsquo;ik, spoken by the Yuit in Alaska and Siberia; Inuktitut spoken by the Canadian Inuit; and Greenlandic spoken by the Greenland Inuit.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>A world of scarcity</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Traditionally, all these people were dependent on the hunting of whales, walrus, seals and caribou, as well as fishing. They shared certain cultural elements, such as the kayak and umiaq (both types of boat), dog sleds, toggling harpoon heads, the ulu (woman&#39;s knife), seal oil lamps, and double-layer skin clothing, as well as certain hunting and fishing techniques, and some religious beliefs and practices.<br />\n"

"<p>However, there were considerable differences as well. Not all of them lived in snow houses, even seasonally, &nbsp;for example. This common stereotype was mainly informed by the accounts of explorers, who, in their search for a Northwest Passage, came into contact with Canadian Inuit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people of the farthest northern reaches of the Americas live in a world of scarcity: finite resources and a hostile environment have created a resourceful and resilient people who retain much of their ancestral tradition and lifestyle.&nbsp;They depend heavily on the animals that live around them, making clothing, complex tools and even structures from the creatures they hunt and fish. With hunting so vital to Arctic livelihood, a variety of specially adapted tools and techniques were developed specifically to catch and utilize prey both on land and by sea.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today, there are about 130,000 Native people living in the North American Arctic. In Canada (Nunavut) and Greenland, they have attained some degree of self-government. In Alaska, much economic and political power is held by Native corporations.</p>\n"

"<p>The vast geographic and environmental diversity of the North American continent has allowed one of the most culturally diverse regions on the planet to emerge.&nbsp;Societies across the continent have developed beautiful and complex material worlds that reflect the character and personality of their territories. Native North American peoples have responded to the universal problems of life in individual and ingenious ways, making best use of their natural resources to build strong and expressive communities.

"<h3>Mummy bundles</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One of the most extraordinary masterpieces of the pre-Columbian Americas is a nearly&nbsp;<span>2,000-year-old cloth from the South Coast of Peru, which has been in the collection of&nbsp;</span><span>the Brooklyn Museum of Art since 1938. </span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Despite the textile&#39;s&nbsp;small size (it measures&nbsp;</span><span>about two&nbsp;by five feet), it contains a vast amount of information about the people&nbsp;</span><span>who lived in ancient Peru; and despite its great age and delicacy, its colors are brilliant,&nbsp;</span><span>and tiny details amazingly intact. This is due to the arid environment of southern Peru&nbsp;</span><span>along the Pacific shore, where it is so dry that organic material buried in the sand remains&nbsp;well preserved for hundreds or even thousands of years.&nbsp;</span><br />\n"

"<h3>Clothing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Arctic, where temperatures are below freezing for most of the year, warm clothing is of great importance. It is vital for hunters who spend many hours outside fishing or hunting seals, walrus, whales and caribou. Traditional Inuit skin clothing is well suited to this purpose because it provides excellent insulation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In winter, two layers of clothes were worn when hunting or traveling. The inner layer has the fur turned inwards towards the body, while the fur of the outer layer is turned outwards. Warm air is trapped between the two layers of clothing and the body, providing excellent insulation against the cold.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today traditional skin clothing remains important to Inuit. Not only are certain kinds of traditional clothing still preferred over manufactured garments, but the making and use of clothing plays a significant role in keeping Inuit cultural values and knowledge alive. Clothing both sustains and expresses Inuit identity.</p>\n"

The back flap is narrow, curving slightly inwards below the waist, and ending in a rounded tip. The decoration with bands of contrasting white and dark stripes of sealskin at the edges of the garment are characteristic of costumes from this part of the eastern Canadian Arctic.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"​Traditional Arctic clothing consists of two layers of caribou skin garments. Caribou skin is used because the hollow hair follicles contain an air bubble; they also trap insulating air. The inner layer has the fur turned inwards towards the skin, while the outer layer has the fur turned outwards. A pocket of insulating air is caught between the body and the two layers of clothing.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Amauti of this style were used by the Inuit of Labrador until their costume changed through the influence of missionaries in the eighteenth century. Thus, it is possible that the amauti dates to the very first years of contact. It may have been worn by one of the Inuit women brought to England by British explorers, who often brought back inhabitants to prove their discoveries. Many of these captured Inuit were painted by European artists, and the paintings - although varying in accuracy of representation - remain valuable documents of Inuit clothing from that time.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Alternatively, the amauti could have been made somewhat later by Inuit of Nunavik. It is very similar to an amauti now in the McCord Museum, Canada that was collected by Dr William Wakeham in 1897, probably on the southern shores of Hudson Strait. This amauti may have been made around the same time in that area.</p>\n"

"<p>The Aleut also made beautiful&nbsp;kamleikas&nbsp;for festive or ceremonial occasions. These were hoodless, with a high collar and decorative bands of colored skin at the collar, cuffs, and hem.

Therefore, before display, the hardened gut of this&nbsp;kamleika&nbsp;was relaxed using water vapor. As the garment regained flexibility, it was gradually cleaned and reshaped into its original form.

"After Charlemagne&rsquo;s legacy had begun to die out, the warlike tribes in what is now Germany (then Saxony) banded together to elect a king from among their nobility. In 919 C.E., they chose Henry the Liudolfing, the son of a high-ranking duke, a brilliant military strategist and a well-respected leader. Henry, dubbed &ldquo;the Fowler&rdquo; because of his hobby of bird hunting, led the Saxon armies to a number of decisive victories against the Magyars and the Danes. &nbsp;These newly secured borders ushered in a period of immense prosperity and artistic productivity for the Saxon empire. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Henry&rsquo;s son Otto I (who became emperor in 962) lends his name to the &ldquo;Ottonian&rdquo; period. He forged an important alliance with the Pope, which allowed him to be crowned the first official Holy Roman Emperor since 924. This contact with Rome was extremely important to Ottonian artistic development, since each Ottonian king was determined to define himself as a Roman Emperor in the style of Constantine and Charlemagne. This meant perpetuating a highly intellectual court and creating an extensive artistic legacy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ottonian art takes a number of traditional medieval forms, including elegantly illuminated manuscripts, lavish metalwork, intricate carving, and Romanesque churches and cathedrals. Perhaps the most famous of the Ottonian artistic innovations is the Saxon Romanesque architecture style, which is marked by a careful attention to balance and mathematical harmony. &nbsp;This focus on geometry is based on the texts de Arithmatica and Ars Geometriae by the 6th century philosopher Boethius. The Ottonians held mathematical sciences in high regard and this is reflected in many of their artistic productions. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The illuminated manuscripts produced by Ottonian &ldquo;scriptoria,&rdquo; or monastery painting and writing schools, provide documentation of both Ottonian religious and political customs and the stylistic preferences of the period. &nbsp;Manuscripts were most often produced of religious texts, and usually included a dedication portrait commemorating the book&rsquo;s creation. &nbsp;The royal or religious donor is usually shown presenting the book to the saint of his or her choice.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"After Charlemagne&rsquo;s legacy had begun to die out, the warlike tribes in what is now Germany (then Saxony) banded together to elect a king from among their nobility. In 919 C.E., they chose Henry the Liudolfing, the son of a high-ranking duke, a brilliant military strategist and a well-respected leader. Henry, dubbed &ldquo;the Fowler&rdquo; because of his hobby of bird hunting, led the Saxon armies to a number of decisive victories against the Magyars and the Danes. &nbsp;These newly secured borders ushered in a period of immense prosperity and artistic productivity for the Saxon empire. &nbsp;</p>\n"

On this ivory, Otto presents a symbolic model of the church to Christ for his blessing. As a humble servant, Otto is depicted smaller than the company of patron saints.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Henry&rsquo;s son Otto I (who became emperor in 962) lends his name to the &ldquo;Ottonian&rdquo; period. He forged an important alliance with the Pope, which allowed him to be crowned the first official Holy Roman Emperor since 924. This contact with Rome was extremely important to Ottonian artistic development, since each Ottonian king was determined to define himself as a Roman Emperor in the style of Constantine and Charlemagne. This meant perpetuating a highly intellectual court and creating an extensive artistic legacy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ottonian art takes a number of traditional medieval forms, including elegantly illuminated manuscripts, lavish metalwork, intricate carving, and Romanesque churches and cathedrals. Perhaps the most famous of the Ottonian artistic innovations is the Saxon Romanesque architecture style, which is marked by a careful attention to balance and mathematical harmony. &nbsp;This focus on geometry is based on the texts de Arithmatica and Ars Geometriae by the 6th century philosopher Boethius. The Ottonians held mathematical sciences in high regard and this is reflected in many of their artistic productions. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The illuminated manuscripts produced by Ottonian &ldquo;scriptoria,&rdquo; or monastery painting and writing schools, provide documentation of both Ottonian religious and political customs and the stylistic preferences of the period. &nbsp;Manuscripts were most often produced of religious texts, and usually included a dedication portrait commemorating the book&rsquo;s creation. &nbsp;The royal or religious donor is usually shown presenting the book to the saint of his or her choice.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Wearing leather</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most medieval bindings were made out of animal skin&mdash;usually it was a calf or pig who involuntarily ended up protecting the manuscript. Leather proved an ideal material for binding books. It is stiff, which means it does an excellent job protecting the precious cargo inside, while at the same time adding to the desired &ldquo;firmness&rdquo; of the book. The material also repels water quite well. This benefit may seem odd, but it&rsquo;s not. While monks may not have been reading books in the bath tub, they did consult them in the cloister, which was often a damp environment&mdash;given that the hallways were in the open air.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>An added bonus of leather was that it accommodated blind-tooled decoration, which was applied in mesmerizing shapes and patterns. The oldest book to survive with its original binding still in place is the seventh-century St Cuthbert Gospel (which is a Gospel of John, in fact, image above). It shows just how utterly charming early-medieval leather bindings were; and how beautifully they were decorated. The manuscript in question was placed in the coffin of St Cuthbert shortly after his death in 687. It was discovered when the grave was opened in the early twelfth century. By then a cult had grown around St Cuthbert, so the book and its original binding&nbsp;were both&nbsp;well taken care of. In fact, the binding looks like it was made yesterday.</p>\n"

"Marking pages for future reading predates browsers and the web. In fact, the practice is much older even than printed books. This essay introduces various ways in which monks and other medieval readers kept track of the page at which they had stopped reading&mdash;and from which they planned to continue in the near future. What tools were available for this purpose? And how did these differ from one another? Apart from addressing these two queries, this post also reports on a genuine discovery: a new specimen of a rare but particularly smart type of bookmark, found at the University Library&nbsp;in Leiden. Cleverly, and unlike our modern equivalent, the bookmark in question showed medieval readers not only at what page they had stopped reading, but also in which text column and line they had left off.</p>\n"

"<p>Essay by Dr. Erik Kwakkel</p>\n"

"<p><br />\n"
"Marking pages for future reading predates browsers and the web. In fact, the practice is much older even than printed books. This essay introduces various ways in which monks and other medieval readers kept track of the page at which they had stopped reading&mdash;and from which they planned to continue in the near future. What tools were available for this purpose? And how did these differ from one another? Apart from addressing these two queries, this post also reports on a genuine discovery: a new specimen of a rare but particularly smart type of bookmark, found at the University Library&nbsp;in Leiden. Cleverly, and unlike our modern equivalent, the bookmark in question showed medieval readers not only at what page they had stopped reading, but also in which text column and line they had left off.</p>\n"

"Michelangelo returned to Florence from Rome in 1501 at the age of twenty-six, and remained there for four years. This was to be one of the most productive periods of his life, and he became a lifelong supporter of Florentine republicanism during this time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Michelangelo, A seated male nude twisting around, pen and brown ink drawing with brown and grey wash and lead white, c. 1404-5, 42.1 x 28.7 cm, © Trustees of the British Museum.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3295cd09cb7582ed229bbe602b82d0053f42a1f0.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Michelangelo<em>,&nbsp;A seated male nude twisting around</em>, c. 1404-5,&nbsp;pen and brown ink drawing with brown and grey wash and lead white, 42.1 x 28.7 cm, Italy &copy; Trustees of the British Museum</span></span></p>\n"

"<h3>Battle of Cascina</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The republican government of Florence commissioned Michelangelo and his great Florentine rival, Leonardo da Vinci, to paint enormous battle scenes celebrating historic Florentine victories in the Palazzo Vecchio. However, these patriotic works were never realized. Michelangelo&rsquo;s only contribution was a large-scale drawing, or cartoon, intended as the central section of the planned composition called the Battle of Cascina, which no longer survives.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Battle of Cascina was a famous fourteenth-century victory over Pisa. Michelangelo&#39;s Bathers depicted the Florentine army hurriedly preparing for battle after a dip in the river. Michelangelo&rsquo;s drawing caused a sensation because of his dynamic portrayal of over life-size figures in action. Many artists flocked to study Michelangelo&rsquo;s hugely influential cartoon. They were thrilled by the way he showed nude and semi nude figures in a variety of &nbsp;unique poses, the whole scene pulsating with movement and drama.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figure is of crucial importance in the larger scene because his turning body directs attention to the bodies behind. Close inspection of the figure reveals that, despite the remarkably realistic three-dimensional rendering, his pose is unnatural. This is particularly true of the upper body, which has been twisted to impossible limits.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Summoned to Rome: the Sistine Chapel ceiling</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Michelangelo was summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II in 1505, spending the years 1508 to 1512 decorating the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican palace.&nbsp;The thirty-three year-old artist had little&nbsp;experience of fresco technique, and the ceiling painting was an extraordinary achievement.&nbsp;Michelangelo&rsquo;s design was a very ambitious one that included painting an architectural framework.

"\n"
"<p>This is the only surviving study for Adam in the&nbsp;<em>Creation of Adam</em>.&nbsp;He painted the figure of Adam, on the second half of the ceiling, around 1511. Adam&nbsp;reclines on his right side, his left arm resting on his left leg stretches out to receive life from God.

"\n"
"<p>According to the Bible, Adam was the first man to be created by God. Michelangelo manages to make the impossible position of Adam&#39;s upper body look convincing, because his observation of his muscular form and the play of light on it is compellingly realistic.&nbsp;Michelangelo must have made a number of further drawings of Adam before the production of the cartoon (the full-size drawing which would have been transferred onto the ceiling). The head and the hands are only in outline here so would have needed refining.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Michelangelo has exploited the qualities of the red chalk to create a warmth of tone as he drew from the live model. He concentrated on the torso and upper legs of his model whose ideal anatomy is indicated by shading, especially on the chest and stomach areas.

"\n"
"<p><span>The drawing is a rare survivor&nbsp;from the many hundreds that Michelangelo made to prepare the ceiling. How did he transform these&nbsp;small-scale figures into their gigantic counterparts on the ceiling? The normal method of enlarging a drawing was to overlay it with a grid of squares, which allowed the design to be copied into larger squares on a cartoon. Michelangelo then transferred the figures to the wet plaster, either by cutting through the outlines on the paper with a knife, or by dusting charcoal through holes punctured in the cartoon.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Fresco</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Fresco painting is notoriously difficult, as it involves applying water-based pigments to wet plaster and has to be done very quickly.

The fresco was painted from a stepped scaffold suspended on wooden rafters. This meant that Michelangelo painted standing up&mdash;contrary to popular belief that he lay on his back.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Examination of the Sistine vault has shown that Michelangelo quickened the pace at which he painted in the second phase of his work.

"<p>Michelangelo returned to Florence from Rome in 1501 at the age of twenty-six, and remained there for four years. This was to be one of the most productive periods of his life, and he became a lifelong supporter of Florentine republicanism during this time.</p>\n"

"<h3>Battle of Cascina</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The republican government of Florence commissioned Michelangelo and his great Florentine rival, Leonardo da Vinci, to paint enormous battle scenes celebrating historic Florentine victories in the Palazzo Vecchio. However, these patriotic works were never realized. Michelangelo&rsquo;s only contribution was a large-scale drawing, or cartoon, intended as the central section of the planned composition called the Battle of Cascina, which no longer survives.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Battle of Cascina was a famous fourteenth-century victory over Pisa. Michelangelo&#39;s Bathers depicted the Florentine army hurriedly preparing for battle after a dip in the river. Michelangelo&rsquo;s drawing caused a sensation because of his dynamic portrayal of over life-size figures in action. Many artists flocked to study Michelangelo&rsquo;s hugely influential cartoon. They were thrilled by the way he showed nude and semi nude figures in a variety of &nbsp;unique poses, the whole scene pulsating with movement and drama.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figure is of crucial importance in the larger scene because his turning body directs attention to the bodies behind. Close inspection of the figure reveals that, despite the remarkably realistic three-dimensional rendering, his pose is unnatural. This is particularly true of the upper body, which has been twisted to impossible limits.</p>\n"

"<h3>Summoned to Rome: the Sistine Chapel ceiling</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Michelangelo was summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II in 1505, spending the years 1508 to 1512 decorating the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican palace.&nbsp;The thirty-three year-old artist had little&nbsp;experience of fresco technique, and the ceiling painting was an extraordinary achievement.&nbsp;Michelangelo&rsquo;s design was a very ambitious one that included painting an architectural framework. He divided the ceiling (over 40m long) into nine&nbsp;compartments, filled with fresco scenes of the creation of the world and man&rsquo;s early history as told in the Bible.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"Renaissance artists had contributed greatly to man&#39;s knowledge by the time Galileo was doing his first work at Pisa. The humanist artists of the Italian renaissance had performed their own dissections to promote the study of anatomy, they had invented mathematical perspective to make possible the accurate, realistic portrayal of physical space. The literary humanists had managed to revive all sorts of classics, in particular the works of Plato. Christopher Columbus had directly challenged the limits to the finite European world of Ptolemy&#39;s geography. In short, the bounds of human knowledge were expanding at a rapid rate.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ludovico Cigoli, Assumption of the Virgin, 1612, fresco, Pauline Chapel, Santa Maria Maggiore\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1f386b7465d34d4ca57577301bf4f592d769a77a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Virgin Mary (detail) &quot;clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet&quot; (Apocalypse 12:1), Ludovico Cigoli, <em>Assumption of the Virgin</em>, 1612, fresco, Pauline Chapel, Santa Maria Maggiore</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Thus it comes as no surprise that Italian artists of Galileo&#39;s day responded favorably, even enthusiastically, to the new discoveries that science itself was making. It was Galileo&#39;s friend, Lodovico Cigoli, who incorporated the latest discoveries of his telescope, hot off the press in Galileo&#39;s <em>Siderius Nuncius</em> (1610) in his own version of the <em>Assumption of the Virgin</em>&nbsp;painted just two years later in 1612. In Cigoli&#39;s painting, notice the treatment of the moon at the Virgin&#39;s feet&mdash;rendered as though it were seen though the telescope, exactly as Galileo had recorded it in his own pen and ink drawing only a few years earlier.*</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Mathematics is the Language of Nature</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In closing, how can we draw together all of the diverse strands of renaissance artistic realism, especially Brunelleschi&#39;s discovery of perspective, with Galileo&#39;s experiments on acceleration and his analysis of projectile motion?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is clear that renaissance artists were seeking a new world, thanks in part to mathematics and the new perspective, literally, that mathematics provided. Galileo not only inherited this perspective, but a philosophical sense as well that had been inspired by renaissance philosophers (especially Neoplatonists), namely that the underlying reality of the world we perceive is essentially mathematical.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"G.B. Riccioli, Almagestum Novum (1651)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ad184ffe9114d538b97700ab4ed05f2ba8facc6a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Hand of God (detail),&nbsp;G.B. Riccioli, frontispiece,&nbsp;<em>Almagestum Novum</em> (1651)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This was exactly the point made in Riccioli&#39;s dramatic depiction of the hand of God, creating the world according to mathematical principles, number and weight and measure written clearly on his fingers to make no mistake about the inherent, essential mathematical character of the physical world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Renaissance artists and architects had already succeeded in translating physical space into the mathematical terms of proportion and perspective to produce works that tricked the eye and rivaled nature.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Galileo used mathematics with equal skill to reveal the underlying structure of physical space and motion to show that these, too, could be reduced to mathematical analysis. In connecting physical space and real motion&mdash;which could be observed experimentally&mdash;with the ideal and uniform change of his neo-platonic, mathematical world, Galileo also serves to bridge the early stages of the scientific revolution in Europe&mdash;and figures like Copernicus and Kepler&mdash;with the later unifying achievements of Descartes, Newton and Leibniz.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Thus in a very direct way, it was mathematics that not only facilitated the art of renaissance perspective, but provided the key as well to Galileo&#39;s new science of nature. In both cases, the essence of physical reality was understood in terms that could be reduced to basic mathematical principles.</p>\n"

"<p>*See Steven F. Ostrow, &ldquo;Cigoli&#39;s Immacolata and Galileo&#39;s Moon: Astronomy and the Virgin in early seicento Rome,&rdquo; <em>Art Bulletin</em>, vol. LXXVIII, no. 2 (June 1996), pp. 218-235 (<a href=\"http://www.mutualart.com/OpenArticle/Cigoli-s-Immacolata-and-Galileo-s-Moon--/0F2C437DF2829CF5\">online here</a>). Ostrow writes:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>Edgerton has argued that Cigoli&#39;s moon was &#39;no doubt inspired by one of Galileo&#39;s original drawings, but a comparison between them immediately reveals that the painter did not, in fact, faithfully copy any of the drawings &nbsp;or, for that matter, any of the engravings published in the Sidereus nuncius.&#39; In light of Cigoli`s professed difficulty with Latin, it is also unlikely that he relied on Galileo&#39;s written description. We do know, however, that by early 1612 Cigoli was in possession of a telescope, through which, as he proudly informed Galileo, he saw the moon &#39;very well.&#39;&nbsp;He may, therefore, have made his own drawings of the moon in conjunction with his work on the fresco, inspired by what he had learned from Galileo and perhaps, too, in an effort to corroborate his friend`s discoveries in the face of mounting criticism in Rome.</p>\n"

"Renaissance artists had contributed greatly to man&#39;s knowledge by the time Galileo was doing his first work at Pisa. The humanist artists of the Italian renaissance had performed their own dissections to promote the study of anatomy, they had invented mathematical perspective to make possible the accurate, realistic portrayal of physical space. The literary humanists had managed to revive all sorts of classics, in particular the works of Plato. Christopher Columbus had directly challenged the limits to the finite European world of Ptolemy&#39;s geography. In short, the bounds of human knowledge were expanding at a rapid rate.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Thus it comes as no surprise that Italian artists of Galileo&#39;s day responded favorably, even enthusiastically, to the new discoveries that science itself was making. It was Galileo&#39;s friend, Lodovico Cigoli, who incorporated the latest discoveries of his telescope, hot off the press in Galileo&#39;s <em>Siderius Nuncius</em> (1610) in his own version of the <em>Assumption of the Virgin</em>&nbsp;painted just two years later in 1612. In Cigoli&#39;s painting, notice the treatment of the moon at the Virgin&#39;s feet&mdash;rendered as though it were seen though the telescope, exactly as Galileo had recorded it in his own pen and ink drawing only a few years earlier.*</p>\n"

"<h3>Mathematics is the Language of Nature</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In closing, how can we draw together all of the diverse strands of renaissance artistic realism, especially Brunelleschi&#39;s discovery of perspective, with Galileo&#39;s experiments on acceleration and his analysis of projectile motion?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is clear that renaissance artists were seeking a new world, thanks in part to mathematics and the new perspective, literally, that mathematics provided. Galileo not only inherited this perspective, but a philosophical sense as well that had been inspired by renaissance philosophers (especially Neoplatonists), namely that the underlying reality of the world we perceive is essentially mathematical.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"G.B. Riccioli, Almagestum Novum (1651)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ad184ffe9114d538b97700ab4ed05f2ba8facc6a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Hand of God (detail),&nbsp;G.B. Riccioli, frontispiece,&nbsp;<em>Almagestum Novum</em> (1651)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This was exactly the point made in Riccioli&#39;s dramatic depiction of the hand of God, creating the world according to mathematical principles, number and weight and measure written clearly on his fingers to make no mistake about the inherent, essential mathematical character of the physical world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Renaissance artists and architects had already succeeded in translating physical space into the mathematical terms of proportion and perspective to produce works that tricked the eye and rivaled nature.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Galileo used mathematics with equal skill to reveal the underlying structure of physical space and motion to show that these, too, could be reduced to mathematical analysis. In connecting physical space and real motion&mdash;which could be observed experimentally&mdash;with the ideal and uniform change of his neo-platonic, mathematical world, Galileo also serves to bridge the early stages of the scientific revolution in Europe&mdash;and figures like Copernicus and Kepler&mdash;with the later unifying achievements of Descartes, Newton and Leibniz.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Thus in a very direct way, it was mathematics that not only facilitated the art of renaissance perspective, but provided the key as well to Galileo&#39;s new science of nature. In both cases, the essence of physical reality was understood in terms that could be reduced to basic mathematical principles.</p>\n"

"<p>Essay by Professor Joseph Dauben</p>\n"

"<p>*See Steven F. Ostrow, &ldquo;Cigoli&#39;s Immacolata and Galileo&#39;s Moon: Astronomy and the Virgin in early seicento Rome,&rdquo; <em>Art Bulletin</em>, vol. LXXVIII, no. 2 (June 1996), pp. 218-235 (<a href=\"http://www.mutualart.com/OpenArticle/Cigoli-s-Immacolata-and-Galileo-s-Moon--/0F2C437DF2829CF5\">online here</a>). Ostrow writes: &quot;Edgerton has argued that Cigoli`s moon was &quot;no doubt inspired by one of Galileo`s original drawings, but a comparison between them immediately reveals that the pinter did not, in fact, faithfully copy any of the drawings &nbsp;or, for that matter, any of the engravings published in the Sidereus nuncius. In light of Cigoli`s professed difficulty with Latin, it is also unlikely that he relied on Galileo`s written description. We do know, however, that by early 1612 Cigoli was in possession of a telescope, through which, as he proudly informed Galileo, he saw the moon &quot;very well.&quot; He may, therefore, have made his own drawings of the moon in conjunction with his work on the fresco, inspired by what he had learned from Galileo and perhaps, too, in an effort to corroborate his friend`s discoveries in the face of mounting criticism in Rome.</p>\n"

"<p>History has no natural divisions. A woman living in Florence in the 15th century did not think of herself as a woman of the Renaissance.

"\n"
"<p>The Neolithic revolution, one of the most profound developments in all of human history, occurs during the Prehistoric Era. This is when our ancestors learned to farm and domesticate animals, allowing them to give up their nomadic ways, and settle down to build cities and civilizations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ancient (c. 3000 B.C.E. to c. 400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This period includes the great early civilizations of the ancient Near East (think Babylonia), ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, the Etruscans, and the Romans&mdash;everything that comes after the invention of writing and before the fall of the Roman Empire. Keep in mind the disintegration of the Roman Empire took centuries, but to simplify, c. 400 will do.</p>\n"

This period is often credited with the birth of Western philosophy, mathematics, theater, science, and democracy. The Romans in turn created an empire that extended across most of Europe, and all the lands that surround the Mediterranean Sea. They were expert administrators and engineers and they saw themselves as the inheritors of the great civilizations that came before them, particularly, Greece and Egypt (which they conquered).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that although history is often presented as a series of discrete stories, in reality narratives often overlap making history both more complex and more interesting. For example, it was also during the Roman Empire that the figure we now call Jesus lived. Jesus and his apostles were Jewish men living in what is today Israel, but which was then part of the Roman Empire.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Middle Ages (c. 400 C.E. to c. 1400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first half of this thousand-year period witnessed terrible political and economic upheaval in Western Europe, as waves of invasions by migrating peoples destabilized the Roman Empire. The Roman emperor Constantine established Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) as a new capital in the East in 330 C.E. and the Western Roman Empire broke apart soon after. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the Byzantine Empire (with Constantinople as its capital), flourished.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Christianity spread across what had been the Roman Empire&mdash;even among migrating invaders (Vandals, Visigoths, etc.).&nbsp;The Christian Church, headed by the Pope, emerged as the most powerful institution in Western Europe, the Orthodox Church dominated in the East.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It was during this period that Islam, one of the three great monotheistic religions, was born. Within little more than a century of the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 C.E., Islam had become an empire that stretched from Spain across North Africa, the Middle and Near East, to India. Medieval Islam was a leader in science and technology and established some of the world&rsquo;s great centers of learning (i.e. Cordoba). Islamic culture played an important role in preserving and translating ancient Greek texts at a time when much of the knowledge created during the ancient world was lost.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Petrarch (a writer who lived in the 1300s) described the early Medieval period as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; because to him it seemed to be a period of declining human achievement, especially when he compared it to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. The &ldquo;Middle Ages&rdquo; got its name because Renaissance scholars saw it as a long barbaric period that separated them from the great civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome that they both celebrated and emulated.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Medieval society was organized into clearly defined strata. At the top was the king. Below were lesser nobles. These lords in turn, ruled over peasants and serfs (the vast majority of the population). Serfs were laborers who were permanently bound to work the land owned by their lord. The basic unit of this system, known as Feudalism, was the lord/vassal relationship. The vassal would provide labor (in the fields or in battle) to the lord in exchange for land and protection. Mobility between strata was very rare.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of course, the thousand years of the Middle Ages saw the creation of many great works of art and literature, but they were different from what Petrarch valued. The works of art created in the Middle Ages were largely focused on the teachings of the Church.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is important to remember that during the Middle Ages it was rare that anyone except members of the clergy (monks, priests, etc.) could read and write. Despite expectations that the world would end in the year 1,000, Western Europe became increasingly stable, and this period is sometimes referred to as the Late (or High) Middle Ages. This period saw the renewal of large scale building and the re-establishment of sizable towns. Monasteries, such as Cluny, became wealthy and important centers of learning.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Within the Middle Ages, there are subdivisions in art history, including Early Christian, Byzantine, Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque and Gothic. When we look closely at much of the art and politics of the 1,000 years of the Middle Ages, we find a complex and ongoing relationship with the memory and legacy of the ancient Roman empire and this is the foundation for the Renaissance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Renaissance (c. 1400 to 1600)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In part, the Renaissance was a rebirth of interest in ancient Greek and Roman culture. It was also a period of economic prosperity in Europe&mdash;particularly in Italy and in Northern Europe. In art history, we study both the Italian Renaissance and the Northern Renaissance. We talk about a way of looking at the world called Humanism, which&mdash;at its most basic&mdash;placed renewed value on human knowledge, and the experience of this world (as opposed to focusing largely on the heavenly realm), using ancient Greek and Roman literature and art as a model.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Raphael, School of Athens, fresco, 1509-1511 (Stanza della Segnatura, Papal Palace, Vatican) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4007aa0c2a1be2ab0641fff50dfc91dbf83d04c4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plato, Aristotle and other ancient philosophers and mathematicians depicted in&nbsp;Raphael&#39;s&nbsp;<em>School of Athens</em>, fresco, 1509-1511 (Stanza della Segnatura, Papal Palace, Vatican) </span></span>There are only a handful of moments in history that we can point to that changed everything. The invention and adoption of the printing press was certainly one. As a result of the wider availability of books, literacy rates in Europe dramatically increased. Readers were empowered and in many ways we can trace the origin of our own information revolution to 15th-century Germany and Gutenberg&rsquo;s first printing press.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1517 a German theologian and monk, Martin Luther, challenged the authority of the Pope and sparked the Protestant Reformation. His ideas spread quickly, thanks in part to the printing press. By challenging the power of the Church, and asserting the authority of individual conscience (it was increasingly possible for people to read the bible in the language that they spoke), the Reformation laid the foundation for the value that modern culture places on the individual.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is also during this period that the Scientific Revolution began and observation replaced religious doctrine as the source of our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Copernicus up-ended the ancient Greek model of the heavens by suggesting that the sun was at the center of the solar system and that the planets orbited in circles around it. However, there were still problems with getting this theory to match observation. At the beginning of the 17th century, Kepler theorized (correctly!) that the planets moved in elliptical orbits (not circular ones) and that the speed of the orbits varied according to the planets&rsquo; distance from the sun. So much for the ideal geometries of the Greeks!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Early Modern (c. 1600 - 1800)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It might seem strange to date the beginning of the &quot;modern era&quot; to so long ago, but in many ways it was the scientific, political and economic revolutions of the 17th and&nbsp;18th&nbsp;centuries that have most shaped our own society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians study the Baroque style of the 17th century. This was a time of extended and often violent conflict between Catholics and Protestants made all the more complex because of the growing power of&nbsp;Europe&rsquo;s great monarchies. It was a time when nations grew in size, wealth and autonomy and when national boundaries were hardened, prefiguring the countries we know today (France, Spain and England for example). This was also a period of colonization, when European powers divided and exploited the world&rsquo;s natural resources and people for their own benefit&nbsp;(think especially of the African slave trade, or the subjugation and forced conversion of the indigenous&nbsp;peoples of the Americas).<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Hendrik Cornelisz Vroom, The Return to Amsterdam of the Second Expedition to the East Indies, 1599, oil on canvas (Rijksmuseum)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8ffa61f2488ecb0bdbffbd45344ca7a8adcd1b79.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Hendrik Cornelisz Vroom, <em>The Return to Amsterdam of the Second Expedition to the East Indies</em>, 1599, oil on canvas (Rijksmuseum)</span></span>The 1700s is often called the Enlightenment. In many ways, it furthers the interest in the individual seen in the Italian Renaissance and more widely during the Protestant Reformation. Thinkers such as Rousseau, Voltaire and Diderot asserted our ability to reason for ourselves instead of relying on the teachings of established institutions, such as the Church. In art history we study the Rococo and Neoclassical styles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The American and French Revolutions date to this period. The emerging middle classes (and later the working-classes) began a centuries-long campaign to gain political power, challenging the control of the aristocracy and monarchy. Successive reform movements (in this period and the 19th century) and revolutions gradually extended the franchise (the right to vote). Previously suffrage had been limited to males who owned land or who paid a certain amount in taxes. It was only in the second half of the 19th and the 20th centuries that universal suffrage became the norm in Europe and North America.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Modern (after c. 1800)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Capitalism became the dominant economic system during this period (though it had its roots in the Renaissance). Individuals risked capital to produce goods in a currency-based market which depended on inexpensive, waged labor. Labor eventually organized into unions (latter-day guilds) and in this way, asserted considerable influence. More broadly shared political power was bolstered by overall increases in the standard of living and the first experiments in public education.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Steam-powered machines and unskilled laborers in factories began to replace skilled artisans. London, Paris, and New York led the unprecedented population growth of cities during this period, as people moved from the countryside or emigrated to find a higher standard of living.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pablo Picasso, Guernica, 1937, oil on canvas, 349 × 776 cm (Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ade5f5a97a3716e43de28b9544ca0b396dab3f92.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pablo Picasso, <em>Guernica</em>, 1937, oil on canvas, 349 &times; 776 cm<br />\n"
"(Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid)</span></span>The 20th Century was the most violent in history. It included two world wars, the Cold War, the dismantling of colonialism and the invention of the Totalitarian state. Dictators (Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, the successive leaders of North Korea, etc.) imposed extreme political systems that caused mass starvation, mass dislocations and genocide. At the same time, the 20th Century was marked by the struggle for human rights and the rise of global capitalism.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where artists had previously worked under the instructions of wealthy patrons associated with the church or state, in this period, art became part of the market economy, and art itself came to be seen as personal self-expression. The high value placed on the individual, which emerged in ancient Greece and Rome and then again in the Renaissance, became the primary value of Western culture. Where artistic styles (for example, Baroque) had once covered numerous artists working over broad regions and periods of time, in the late Nineteenth and through the 20th Century, successive styles of art change with increasing speed and fracture into a kaleidoscope of individual artistic practices.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Where do we fit in?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We are immersed in our own time and it can be difficult to see the world around us objectively. One of the modern definitions of an artist, in fact, is someone who is particularly insightful about their own cultural moment. Thanks to global capitalism, social media and the internet, we are more interconnected and interdependent than at any other time in history. Some see this as a utopian moment. With internet access, we can all contribute to and benefit from what is being called the Information Revolution. For others, the prevalence of technology in our lives threatens our individuality and privacy, and reduces us to a data point that can be monetized by corporations like Facebook, Google, and Apple. One thing is certain, throughout the time periods sketched above, art has meant different things, and it is likely to be differently defined in the future.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The history of humanity is recorded in our visual culture. Like the fate of previous civilizations, time will eventually destroy much of the visual culture that we are familiar with today. Future art historians will seek to reconstruct the world we now live in, to better understand the nuanced meanings that are so familiar to us. Perhaps someday an art historian will puzzle over an internet meme, a Torqued Ellipse by Richard Serra, or school-yard graffiti.</p>\n"

They were expert administrators and engineers and they saw themselves as the inheritors of the great civilizations that came before them, particularly, Greece and Egypt (which they conquered).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that although history is often presented as a series of discrete stories, in reality narratives often overlap making history both more complex and more interesting. For example, it was also during the Roman Empire that the figure we now call Jesus lived. Jesus and his apostles were Jewish men living in what is today Israel, but which was then part of the Roman Empire.</p>\n"

"<h3>Middle Ages (c. 400 C.E. to c. 1400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first half of this thousand-year period witnessed terrible political and economic upheaval in Western Europe, as waves of invasions by migrating peoples destabilized the Roman Empire. The Roman emperor Constantine established Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) as a new capital in the East in 330 C.E. and the Western Roman Empire broke apart soon after. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the Byzantine Empire (with Constantinople as its capital), flourished.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Christianity spread across what had been the Roman Empire&mdash;even among migrating invaders (Vandals, Visigoths, etc.).&nbsp;The Christian Church, headed by the Pope, emerged as the most powerful institution in Western Europe, the Orthodox Church dominated in the East.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It was during this period that Islam, one of the three great monotheistic religions, was born. Within little more than a century of the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 C.E., Islam had become an empire that stretched from Spain across North Africa, the Middle and Near East, to India. Medieval Islam was a leader in science and technology and established some of the world&rsquo;s great centers of learning (i.e. Cordoba). Islamic culture played an important role in preserving and translating ancient Greek texts at a time when much of the knowledge created during the ancient world was lost.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Petrarch (a writer who lived in the 1300s) described the early Medieval period as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; because to him it seemed to be a period of declining human achievement, especially when he compared it to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. The &ldquo;Middle Ages&rdquo; got its name because Renaissance scholars saw it as a long barbaric period that separated them from the great civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome that they both celebrated and emulated.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Medieval society was organized into clearly defined strata. At the top was the king. Below were lesser nobles. These lords in turn, ruled over peasants and serfs (the vast majority of the population). Serfs were laborers who were permanently bound to work the land owned by their lord. The basic unit of this system, known as Feudalism, was the lord/vassal relationship. The vassal would provide labor (in the fields or in battle) to the lord in exchange for land and protection. Mobility between strata was very rare.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of course, the thousand years of the Middle Ages saw the creation of many great works of art and literature, but they were different from what Petrarch valued. The works of art created in the Middle Ages were largely focused on the teachings of the Church.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is important to remember that during the Middle Ages it was rare that anyone except members of the clergy (monks, priests, etc.) could read and write. Despite expectations that the world would end in the year 1,000, Western Europe became increasingly stable, and this period is sometimes referred to as the Late (or High) Middle Ages. This period saw the renewal of large scale building and the re-establishment of sizable towns. Monasteries, such as Cluny, became wealthy and important centers of learning.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Within the Middle Ages, there are subdivisions in art history, including Early Christian, Byzantine, Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque and Gothic. When we look closely at much of the art and politics of the 1,000 years of the Middle Ages, we find a complex and ongoing relationship with the memory and legacy of the ancient Roman empire and this is the foundation for the Renaissance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Renaissance (c. 1400 to 1600)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In part, the Renaissance was a rebirth of interest in ancient Greek and Roman culture. It was also a period of economic prosperity in Europe&mdash;particularly in Italy and in Northern Europe. In art history, we study both the Italian Renaissance and the Northern Renaissance. We talk about a way of looking at the world called Humanism, which&mdash;at its most basic&mdash;placed renewed value on human knowledge, and the experience of this world (as opposed to focusing largely on the heavenly realm), using ancient Greek and Roman literature and art as a model.</p>\n"

The invention and adoption of the printing press was certainly one. As a result of the wider availability of books, literacy rates in Europe dramatically increased. Readers were empowered and in many ways we can trace the origin of our own information revolution to 15th-century Germany and Gutenberg&rsquo;s first printing press.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1517 a German theologian and monk, Martin Luther, challenged the authority of the Pope and sparked the Protestant Reformation. His ideas spread quickly, thanks in part to the printing press. By challenging the power of the Church, and asserting the authority of individual conscience (it was increasingly possible for people to read the bible in the language that they spoke), the Reformation laid the foundation for the value that modern culture places on the individual.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is also during this period that the Scientific Revolution began and observation replaced religious doctrine as the source of our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Copernicus up-ended the ancient Greek model of the heavens by suggesting that the sun was at the center of the solar system and that the planets orbited in circles around it. However, there were still problems with getting this theory to match observation. At the beginning of the 17th century, Kepler theorized (correctly!) that the planets moved in elliptical orbits (not circular ones) and that the speed of the orbits varied according to the planets&rsquo; distance from the sun. So much for the ideal geometries of the Greeks!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Early Modern (c. 1600 - 1800)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It might seem strange to date the beginning of the &quot;modern era&quot; to so long ago, but in many ways it was the scientific, political and economic revolutions of the 17th and&nbsp;18th&nbsp;centuries that have most shaped our own society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians study the Baroque style of the 17th century. This was a time of extended and often violent conflict between Catholics and Protestants made all the more complex because of the growing power of&nbsp;Europe&rsquo;s great monarchies. It was a time when nations grew in size, wealth and autonomy and when national boundaries were hardened, prefiguring the countries we know today (France, Spain and England for example). This was also a period of colonization, when European powers divided and exploited the world&rsquo;s natural resources and people for their own benefit&nbsp;(think especially of the African slave trade, or the subjugation and forced conversion of the indigenous&nbsp;peoples of the Americas).<br />\n"

In many ways, it furthers the interest in the individual seen in the Italian Renaissance and more widely during the Protestant Reformation. Thinkers such as Rousseau, Voltaire and Diderot asserted our ability to reason for ourselves instead of relying on the teachings of established institutions, such as the Church. In art history we study the Rococo and Neoclassical styles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The American and French Revolutions date to this period. The emerging middle classes (and later the working-classes) began a centuries-long campaign to gain political power, challenging the control of the aristocracy and monarchy. Successive reform movements (in this period and the 19th century) and revolutions gradually extended the franchise (the right to vote). Previously suffrage had been limited to males who owned land or who paid a certain amount in taxes. It was only in the second half of the 19th and the 20th centuries that universal suffrage became the norm in Europe and North America.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Modern (after c. 1800)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Capitalism became the dominant economic system during this period (though it had its roots in the Renaissance). Individuals risked capital to produce goods in a currency-based market which depended on inexpensive, waged labor. Labor eventually organized into unions (latter-day guilds) and in this way, asserted considerable influence. More broadly shared political power was bolstered by overall increases in the standard of living and the first experiments in public education.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Steam-powered machines and unskilled laborers in factories began to replace skilled artisans. London, Paris, and New York led the unprecedented population growth of cities during this period, as people moved from the countryside or emigrated to find a higher standard of living.</p>\n"

"(Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid)</span></span>The 20th Century was the most violent in history. It included two world wars, the Cold War, the dismantling of colonialism and the invention of the Totalitarian state. Dictators (Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, the successive leaders of North Korea, etc.) imposed extreme political systems that caused mass starvation, mass dislocations and genocide. At the same time, the 20th Century was marked by the struggle for human rights and the rise of global capitalism.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where artists had previously worked under the instructions of wealthy patrons associated with the church or state, in this period, art became part of the market economy, and art itself came to be seen as personal self-expression. The high value placed on the individual, which emerged in ancient Greece and Rome and then again in the Renaissance, became the primary value of Western culture. Where artistic styles (for example, Baroque) had once covered numerous artists working over broad regions and periods of time, in the late Nineteenth and through the 20th Century, successive styles of art change with increasing speed and fracture into a kaleidoscope of individual artistic practices.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Where do we fit in?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We are immersed in our own time and it can be difficult to see the world around us objectively. One of the modern definitions of an artist, in fact, is someone who is particularly insightful about their own cultural moment. Thanks to global capitalism, social media and the internet, we are more interconnected and interdependent than at any other time in history. Some see this as a utopian moment. With internet access, we can all contribute to and benefit from what is being called the Information Revolution. For others, the prevalence of technology in our lives threatens our individuality and privacy, and reduces us to a data point that can be monetized by corporations like Facebook, Google, and Apple. One thing is certain, throughout the time periods sketched above, art has meant different things, and it is likely to be differently defined in the future.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The history of humanity is recorded in our visual culture. Like the fate of previous civilizations, time will eventually destroy much of the visual culture that we are familiar with today. Future art historians will seek to reconstruct the world we now live in, to better understand the nuanced meanings that are so familiar to us. Perhaps someday an art historian will puzzle over an internet meme, a Torqued Ellipse by Richard Serra, or school-yard graffiti.</p>\n"

"<h3>High civilization</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This sculpture is an exquisite example of art from ancient Mesoamerica, an area of high civilization that includes the territory of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of El Salvador and Honduras. Long before the coming of the Spanish in the sixteenth century, this area independently developed cities and created monumental architecture and sculpture in the city center. Cities were thriving before 1000 B.C.E., or 2,000 years before this sculpture was carved. Important ancient Mesoamerican beings&mdash;noble men and women as well as deities&mdash;were often immortalized in stone and placed in important public places.&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know if the young man seen on the front of this stela represented a young ruler or a god, but we can say that this was an important figure that would have been placed in the center an ancient city, as a focal point for religious ritual.</p>\n"

We do not know what most of these symbols meant, but we do know that Mesoamericans greatly valued such decoration, for the practice was very ancient. Some of these symbols seem to locate the human or god in sacred space and time, suggesting a deeply religious function for the painting. Other symbols, such as the large ear ornaments worn by the young man, also identify the figure as a deity or a ruler.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>A marker of rule</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The young man wears a solemn expression. His face is so expressionless that it appears mask-like, much like the solemn stone masks found in earlier periods in ancient Mesoamerica. There is little room for individual characteristics or personality in this tradition. Instead, ancient Mesoamericans in general seem to have been more interested in the office a person (or god) inhabited and the symbols of that office. The large headdress that forms a halo around the man&rsquo;s head served a similar function, as a marker of rule, or a sort of crown. The main artistic focus throughout the piece, whether we look at the incised body decoration, the ideal face, or the headdress, is to identify an important office or deity.<br />\n"

The serene, youthful appearance was the appropriate bearing of a ruler or god. This ideal view of rulers and gods was true not only in the Huastec area, but among many ancient Mesoamerican peoples.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"This sculpture would have been set in the center of the city, much like the earlier Classic Maya portrait stelae (see image at left). Whether it was placed outside in a public area, or in the interior of a temple, we are not certain. It is remarkably well preserved, with the delicate details in low relief still easily visible on the arms and legs, which leads one to believe that this was kept indoors, perhaps in a shrine. In such a shrine, the figure could have been worshipped as a god, or the statue could be the record of a ruler who did the worshipping. In either case, the sculpture would have been seen as the envelope for the living essence of the god or ruler and thus the focus of religious ritual.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Teomama</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The insights above do not explain the presence of the animated skeletal figure on the other side of the sculpture. If you look closely, you can pick out the outline of a rectangular form immediately behind this figure. This form probably represents cloth. Further, the skeletal figure is not a separate figure, but is attached to the back of the young man.&nbsp;It is probable that the young man was seen as carrying the skeletal figure on his back.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>A marker of rule</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The young man wears a solemn expression. His face is so expressionless that it appears mask-like, much like the solemn stone masks found in earlier periods in ancient Mesoamerica. There is little room for individual characteristics or personality in this tradition. Instead, ancient Mesoamericans in general seem to have been more interested in the office a person (or god) inhabited and the symbols of that office. The large headdress that forms a halo around the man&rsquo;s head served a similar function, as a marker of rule, or a sort of crown. The main artistic focus throughout the piece, whether we look at the incised body decoration, the ideal face, or the headdress, is to identify an important office or deity.<br />\n"

The serene, youthful appearance was the appropriate bearing of a ruler or god. This ideal view of rulers and gods was true not only in the Huastec area, but among many ancient Mesoamerican peoples.<br />\n"

"This sculpture would have been set in the center of the city, much like the earlier Classic Maya portrait stelae (see image at left). Whether it was placed outside in a public area, or in the interior of a temple, we are not certain. It is remarkably well preserved, with the delicate details in low relief still easily visible on the arms and legs, which leads one to believe that this was kept indoors, perhaps in a shrine. In such a shrine, the figure could have been worshipped as a god, or the statue could be the record of a ruler who did the worshipping. In either case, the sculpture would have been seen as the envelope for the living essence of the god or ruler and thus the focus of religious ritual.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The insights above do not explain the presence of the animated skeletal figure on the other side of the sculpture. If you look closely, you can pick out the outline of a rectangular form immediately behind this figure. This form probably represents cloth. Further, the skeletal figure is not a separate figure, but is attached to the back of the young man.&nbsp;It is probable that the young man was seen as carrying the skeletal figure on his back.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Sir Francis Bacon</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In 1620, around the time that people first began to look through microscopes, an English politician named Sir Francis Bacon developed a method for philosophers to use in weighing the truthfulness of knowledge. While Bacon agreed with medieval thinkers that humans too often erred in interpreting what their five senses perceived, he also realized that people&#39;s sensory experiences provided the best possible means of making sense of the world. Because humans could incorrectly interpret anything they saw, heard, smelled, tasted, or felt, Bacon insisted that they must doubt everything before assuming its truth.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Testing hypotheses</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In order to test potential truths, or hypotheses, Bacon devised a method whereby scientists set up experiments to manipulate nature, and attempt to prove their hypotheses wrong. For example, in order to test the idea that sickness came from external causes, Bacon argued that scientists should expose healthy people to outside influences such as coldness, wetness, or other sick people to discover if any of these external variables resulted in more people getting sick. Knowing that many different causes for sickness might be missed by humans who are unable or unwilling to perceive them, Bacon insisted that experiments must be consistently repeated before truth can be known: a scientist must show that patients exposed to a specific variable more frequently got sick again, and again, and again.</p>\n"

Rather, Bacon&#39;s work should be seen as a part of a widespread cultural revolution accelerated by the rise of the printing press in the fifteenth century.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Importance of the printing press</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Advances in the ability to disseminate new ideas by making standardized letters, numbers, and diagrams repeatable allowed for an unprecedented level of cooperation among philosophers who could now build on each other&#39;s ideas over long periods of time. It would be difficult to overstate the effect of the print revolution. Astronomers such as Copernicus and Galileo began to share and build upon their experiments, and religious reformers began to publicize new (and increasingly radical) Protestant ideas. In a mutually beneficial relationship the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution encouraged philosophers to discover all they could about nature as a way to learn more about God, an undertaking that promoted a break with past authorities.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A direct engagement with nature</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Artisans and craftspeople soon began engaging in the new &quot;natural philosophy,&quot; exemplifying the fact that a monumental shift in what constituted evidence for truth was under way. Not only did renaissance artisans create lenses to see, tools to measure, and artworks to replicate the natural world, but by the sixteenth century, they began to publish philosophical treatises asserting that through the imitation and reproduction of nature in their arts, they were able to achieve a state of direct engagement with nature. Rather than taking knowledge from ancient sources, they argued that true knowledge came from direct experience. Alchemists likewise prioritized direct engagement with nature. In using fire to divide elements into their &quot;smallest&quot; components (and discovering that there were more than four of them), alchemists promoted the revolutionary idea that observation of nature itself, rather than reliance on ancient authorities, provided the best foundation for knowledge.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<p>During the Gothic period and the Renaissance (1100s&ndash;1500s) stained glass was one of the foremost techniques of painting practiced in Europe. It may seem surprising to call stained glass a form of painting, but in fact it is. Look closely at the image here and note that the surfaces of each piece of glass are painted in a wide range of dark tones. One of the most widespread forms of painting, stained glass inspired the lives of the faithful through religious narratives in churches and cloisters, celebrated family and political ties in city halls, and even decorated the windows of private houses.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Why is it called&nbsp;stained&nbsp;glass?</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The term stained glass derives from the silver stain that was often applied to the side of the window that would face the outside of the building. When the glass was fired, the silver stain turned a yellow color that could range from lemon to gold.&nbsp;Stained glass was usually used to make windows, so that the light would shine through the painting.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is a form of painting that began over 1,000 years ago and is still essentially made the same way today.</p>\n"

"<p>During the Gothic period and the Renaissance (1100s&ndash;1500s) stained glass was one of the foremost techniques of painting practiced in Europe. It may seem surprising to call stained glass a form of painting, but in fact it is. Look closely at the image here and note that the surfaces of each piece of glass are painted in a wide range of dark tones. One of the most widespread forms of painting, stained glass inspired the lives of the faithful through religious narratives in churches and cloisters, celebrated family and political ties in city halls, and even decorated the windows of private houses.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Why is it called&nbsp;stained&nbsp;glass?</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The term stained glass derives from the silver stain that was often applied to the side of the window that would face the outside of the building. When the glass was fired, the silver stain turned a yellow color that could range from lemon to gold.&nbsp;Stained glass was usually used to make windows, so that the light would shine through the painting.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is a form of painting that began over 1,000 years ago and is still essentially made the same way today.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>While there is no one text or creed that forms the basis of all Hindu beliefs, several texts are considered fundamental to all branches of Hinduism. These texts are generally divided into two main groups: eternal, revealed texts, and those based upon what humanity has learned and written down. The Vedas are an example of the former, while the two great epics, the <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em>, belong to the latter category. For centuries, texts were transmitted orally, and the priestly caste, or brahmans, was entrusted with memorization and preservation of sacred texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Vedas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Vedas are India&rsquo;s earliest surviving texts, dating from approximately 2000 to 1500 B.C.E. These texts are made up of hymns and ritual treatises that are instructional in nature, along with other sections that are more speculative and metaphysical. The Vedas are greatly revered by contemporary Hindus as forming the foundation for their deepest beliefs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The early Vedas refer often to certain gods such as Indra, the thunder god, and Agni, who carries messages between humans and the gods through fire sacrifices. Some of these gods persist in later Hinduism, while others are diminished or transformed into other deities over time. The Vedas are considered a timeless revelation, and a source of unchanging knowledge that underlies much of present-day Hindu practices.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These two great epics are the most widely known works in India. Every child becomes familiar with these stories from an early age. The <em>Mahabharata</em> is the world&rsquo;s longest poem, with approximately 100,000 verses. It tells the story of the conflict between the Pandava brothers and their cousins the Kauravas, a rivalry that culminates in a great battle. On the eve of the battle, the Pandava warrior Arjuna is distressed by what will happen. The god Krishna consoles him in a famous passage known as the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> (meaning &ldquo;the Song of the Lord&rdquo;). This section of the <em>Mahabharata</em> has become a standard reference in addressing the duty of the individual, the importance of dharma, and humankind&rsquo;s relationship to God and society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A second epic, the <em>Ramayana</em>, contains some of India&rsquo;s best-loved characters, including Rama and Sita, the ideal royal couple, and their helper, the monkey leader, Hanuman. Rama is an incarnation of the God Vishnu. The story tells of Rama and Sita&rsquo;s withdrawal to the forest after being exiled from the kingdom of Ayodhya. Sita is abducted in the forest by Ravana, the evil king of Lanka. Rama eventually defeats Ravana, with the help of his brother and an army of monkeys and bears. The couple returns to Ayodhya and are crowned, and from that point the story has evolved to acquire different endings. Episodes of the Ramayana are frequently illustrated in Hindu art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Puranas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Puranas are the primary source of stories about the Hindu deities. They were probably assembled between 300 to 1000 C.E., and their presence corresponds to the rise of Hinduism and the growing importance of certain deities. They describe the exploits of the gods as well as various devotional practices associated with them. Some of the Vedic gods&mdash;Indra, Agni, Surya&mdash;reappear in the Puranas, but figure less importantly in the stories than do Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, the various manifestations of the Goddess, and other celestial figures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Tantras</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Around the same time as the recording of the Puranas, a number of texts concerning ritual practices surrounding various deities emerge. They are collectively known as Tantras or Agamas, and refer to religious observances, yoga, behavior, and the proper selection and design of temple sites. Some aspects of the Tantras concern the harnessing of physical energies as a means to achieve spiritual breakthrough. Tantric practices cross religious boundaries, and manifest themselves in aspects of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.</p>\n"

"<p>While there is no one text or creed that forms the basis of all Hindu beliefs, several texts are considered fundamental to all branches of Hinduism. These texts are generally divided into two main groups: eternal, revealed texts, and those based upon what humanity has learned and written down. The Vedas are an example of the former, while the two great epics, the <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em>, belong to the latter category. For centuries, texts were transmitted orally, and the priestly caste, or brahmans, was entrusted with memorization and preservation of sacred texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Vedas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Vedas are India&rsquo;s earliest surviving texts, dating from approximately 2000 to 1500 B.C.E. These texts are made up of hymns and ritual treatises that are instructional in nature, along with other sections that are more speculative and metaphysical. The Vedas are greatly revered by contemporary Hindus as forming the foundation for their deepest beliefs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The early Vedas refer often to certain gods such as Indra, the thunder god, and Agni, who carries messages between humans and the gods through fire sacrifices. Some of these gods persist in later Hinduism, while others are diminished or transformed into other deities over time. The Vedas are considered a timeless revelation, and a source of unchanging knowledge that underlies much of present-day Hindu practices.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These two great epics are the most widely known works in India. Every child becomes familiar with these stories from an early age. The <em>Mahabharata</em> is the world&rsquo;s longest poem, with approximately 100,000 verses. It tells the story of the conflict between the Pandava brothers and their cousins the Kauravas, a rivalry that culminates in a great battle. On the eve of the battle, the Pandava warrior Arjuna is distressed by what will happen. The god Krishna consoles him in a famous passage known as the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> (meaning &ldquo;the Song of the Lord&rdquo;). This section of the <em>Mahabharata</em> has become a standard reference in addressing the duty of the individual, the importance of dharma, and humankind&rsquo;s relationship to God and society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A second epic, the <em>Ramayana</em>, contains some of India&rsquo;s best-loved characters, including Rama and Sita, the ideal royal couple, and their helper, the monkey leader, Hanuman. Rama is an incarnation of the God Vishnu. The story tells of Rama and Sita&rsquo;s withdrawal to the forest after being exiled from the kingdom of Ayodhya. Sita is abducted in the forest by Ravana, the evil king of Lanka. Rama eventually defeats Ravana, with the help of his brother and an army of monkeys and bears. The couple returns to Ayodhya and are crowned, and from that point the story has evolved to acquire different endings. Episodes of the Ramayana are frequently illustrated in Hindu art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Puranas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Puranas are the primary source of stories about the Hindu deities. They were probably assembled between 300 to 1000 C.E., and their presence corresponds to the rise of Hinduism and the growing importance of certain deities. They describe the exploits of the gods as well as various devotional practices associated with them. Some of the Vedic gods&mdash;Indra, Agni, Surya&mdash;reappear in the Puranas, but figure less importantly in the stories than do Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, the various manifestations of the Goddess, and other celestial figures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Tantras</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Around the same time as the recording of the Puranas, a number of texts concerning ritual practices surrounding various deities emerge. They are collectively known as Tantras or Agamas, and refer to religious observances, yoga, behavior, and the proper selection and design of temple sites. Some aspects of the Tantras concern the harnessing of physical energies as a means to achieve spiritual breakthrough. Tantric practices cross religious boundaries, and manifest themselves in aspects of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Brown and the Pre-Raphaelites</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ford Madox Brown is associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of British artists noted for their attention to detail, vibrant colors, and interest in scenes from literature. Although Brown himself was never an official member of the PRB, he was friendly with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others in the group. The two got to know each other when Rossetti appeared on Brown&rsquo;s doorstep in 1848 asking for art lessons. Although the lessons were short-lived, the two developed a lasting friendship. Through his association with the PRB, Brown adopted many of their stylistic tendencies, particularly the use of bright colors and attention to detail.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Modern Life</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, Brown&rsquo;s paintings show a much greater interest in subjects of modern life than many of the other artists associated with the PRB. Brown recalled that he got the idea for <em>Work </em>from seeing navvies, or construction workers, excavating sewers in Hampstead, North London. The painting was begun in the summer of 1852. Brown traveled to the same spot in Hampstead every day, transporting his canvas back and forth by means of a special cart. The background landscape of the painting was completed right on the street in Hampstead so that Brown could capture the precise details of light, color and form. This interest in direct observation and specificity were hallmarks of the Pre-Raphaelite style.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>VIctorian ideas of class</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting centers on a group of working-class navvies. These figures represent the noble &ldquo;working man,&rdquo; as they are neatly dressed and diligently going about their tasks. In contrast to the workers, there is a group of ragged children in the foreground, representing the lowest of the lower classes. In the catalogue of his 1865 one-man exhibition, Brown tells us that the children&rsquo;s mother is dead, and that the oldest, a girl of ten, is in charge of the rest of the children. She wears a tattered dress and is holding an infant over one shoulder.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Also representative of the lowest class is the ragged and barefoot plant seller on the left side, a figure whom Brown described as a &ldquo;ragged wretch who has never been taught to work.&rdquo; This hunched figure represents a stark contrast to the industrious and athletic navvies. shoveling away. Both the workers and the ragged children form another contrast, this time to the upper class figures depicted in the painting. On the left hand side, two ladies skirt the edge of the picture. The first, lady carrying a parasol, is a portrait of the artist&rsquo;s Brown&rsquo;s wife Emma. Following along behind is another well-dressed woman who offers a religious tract to one of the navvies. Seeing to the religious education of the lower classes was a type of &ldquo;work&rdquo; engaged in by many evangelical middle-class women.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"On the right side of the painting, two well-dressed men watch the navvies work.

Maurice was a leading Christian Socialist and founder of the Working Men&rsquo;s College, where Brown was recruited as an instructor along with Rossetti and the art critic John Ruskin. One of the posters visible on the far left side on the canvas is an advertisement for the Working Men&rsquo;s College.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At first glance Brown&rsquo;s painting <em>Work </em>may appear to be an illustration of the stratification of social class in Victorian England. However, a deeper look reveals both a stunning example of the colorful and detailed Pre-Raphaelite style of painting as well as a commentary on the role of &ldquo;work,&rdquo; and its relationship to Victorian class structure. &nbsp;<em>Work </em>is at once a vivid reminder of both the class-consciousness of the Victorian age and the reforming spirit of that time which ultimately led to reforms like the ten-hour work day, and regulations restricting child labor.</p>\n"

Taken from the play <em>Measure for Measure</em>, which tells the story of Claudio, who has been sentenced to death by Lord Angelo (the temporary ruler of Vienna) for impregnating his fianc&eacute;e. Claudio&rsquo;s sister Isabella, a nun, goes to Angelo to plead for clemency for her brother and is shocked that he suggests that she trade sex for her brother&rsquo;s life. Of course, she refuses, and Claudio initially agrees with her decision, but later changes his mind. Hunt depicts the moment when the imprisoned Claudio suggests that Isabella sacrifice her virginity to gain his freedom. It was the type of subject that appealed to Hunt, who liked themes to do with questions of guilt and sinful behavior, such as his well known painting <em>The Awakening Conscience</em> (1853).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Claudio and Isabella</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Claudio&rsquo;s face, which is partly in shadow, looks down and away from his sister. His slouching posture, the rich texture of his dark, yet colorful clothes and pointed medieval-looking shoes are a sharp contrast to the stark white of the nun&rsquo;s habit, her upright posture and unwavering gaze. Sunlight from the prison window lights Isabella&rsquo;s face and permits a glimpse of apple blossoms and a church in the distance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/465527153d1ea3e87a0c242ea6295892d377c8b2.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Shackle (detail), William Holman Hunt, <em>Claudio and Isabella</em>, 1850, oil on mahogany, 75.8 x 42.6&nbsp;cm (London, Tate Britain)</span></span>The interior of the scene was painted at Lollard Prison at Lambeth Palace, and the crumbling masonry around the windows and the rusty metal of the shackle that bind Claudio&rsquo;s leg detail the less than desirable conditions. Hunt also painted the lute hanging in the window while at the prison. The lute with its red string is symbolic of lust, but the fact that it is placed in the sunshine rather than the gloom of the cell lessens the negative impact. The petals of apple blossom scattered on Claudio&rsquo;s cloak on the floor, although not added until 1879, are intended to show that Claudio is willing to compromise his sister to save himself.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Financial difficulties&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>Claudio and Isabella</em> was begun in 1850 after Hunt received a small advance from the painter Augustus Egg. Poor reviews of the Pre-Raphaelite paintings at the Royal Academy of 1850 had created financial difficulties for Hunt. He continued to work on the painting for the next several years, finally exhibiting the picture at the Royal Academy of 1853.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&quot;Death is a fearful thing&quot;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting appeared with a quotation from the play carved into the frame, a devise Hunt was to explore in many of his paintings, as a way of reinforcing his message. The short notation &ldquo;Claudio: Death is a fearful thing. Isabella: And shamed life a hateful,&rdquo; serves not only to point to the exact moment in the play, but also as a reminder of the underlying moral dilemma of the subject.&nbsp;The ability to bring to life these moments of ambiguity was one of Hunt&rsquo;s greatest achievements.</p>\n"

Taken from the play <em>Measure for Measure</em>, which tells the story of Claudio, who has been sentenced to death by Lord Angelo (the temporary ruler of Vienna) for impregnating his fianc&eacute;e. Claudio&rsquo;s sister Isabella, a nun, goes to Angelo to plead for clemency for her brother and is shocked that he suggests that she trade sex for her brother&rsquo;s life. Of course, she refuses, and Claudio initially agrees with her decision, but later changes his mind. Hunt depicts the moment when the imprisoned Claudio suggests that Isabella sacrifice her virginity to gain his freedom. It was the type of subject that appealed to Hunt, who liked themes to do with questions of guilt and sinful behavior, such as his well known painting <em>The Awakening Conscience</em> (1853).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Claudio and Isabella</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Claudio&rsquo;s face, which is partly in shadow, looks down and away from his sister. His slouching posture, the rich texture of his dark, yet colorful clothes and pointed medieval-looking shoes are a sharp contrast to the stark white of the nun&rsquo;s habit, her upright posture and unwavering gaze. Sunlight from the prison window lights Isabella&rsquo;s face and permits a glimpse of apple blossoms and a church in the distance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/465527153d1ea3e87a0c242ea6295892d377c8b2.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Shackle (detail), William Holman Hunt, <em>Claudio and Isabella</em>, 1850, oil on mahogany, 75.8 x 42.6&nbsp;cm (London, Tate Britain)</span></span>The interior of the scene was painted at Lollard Prison at Lambeth Palace, and the crumbling masonry around the windows and the rusty metal of the shackle that bind Claudio&rsquo;s leg detail the less than desirable conditions. Hunt also painted the lute hanging in the window while at the prison. The lute with its red string is symbolic of lust, but the fact that it is placed in the sunshine rather than the gloom of the cell lessens the negative impact. The pedals of apple blossom scattered on Claudio&rsquo;s cloak on the floor, although not added until 1879, are intended to show that Claudio is willing to compromise his sister to save himself.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Financial difficulties&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>Claudio and Isabella</em> was begun in 1850 after Hunt received a small advance from the painter Augustus Egg. Poor reviews of the Pre-Raphaelite paintings at the Royal Academy of 1850 had created financial difficulties for Hunt. He continued to work on the painting for the next several years, finally exhibiting the picture at the Royal Academy of 1853.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&quot;Death is a fearful thing&quot;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting appeared with a quotation from the play carved into the frame, a devise Hunt was to explore in many of his paintings, as a way of reinforcing his message. The short notation &ldquo;Claudio: Death is a fearful thing. Isabella: And shamed life a hateful,&rdquo; serves not only to point to the exact moment in the play, but also as a reminder of the underlying moral dilemma of the subject.&nbsp;The ability to bring to life these moments of ambiguity was one of Hunt&rsquo;s greatest achievements.</p>\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Within the city of Uruk, there was a large temple complex dedicated to Innana, the patron goddess of the city.

"\n"
"<p>The head of the temple administration, the chief priest of Innana, also served as political leader, making Uruk the first known theocracy.&nbsp;We know many details about this theocratic administration because the Sumerians left numerous documents in the form of tablets written in&nbsp;cuneiform script.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>A single reed, cleanly cut from the banks of the Euphrates or Tigris river, when pressed cut-edge down into a soft clay tablet, will make a wedge shape. The arrangement of multiple wedge shapes (as few as two and as many as ten) created cuneiform characters.

"\n"
"<p>Very few cuneiform signs have only one meaning; most have as many as four. Cuneiform signs could represent a whole word or an idea or a number. Most frequently though, they represented a syllable.

"<h3>Cult of domesticity</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the mid-nineteenth century, many people were troubled by the effects that the Industrial Revolution was having on the environment, society at large, and workers employed in factories, concerns that are echoed in today&rsquo;s environmental movement. &nbsp;The English art critic John Ruskin&nbsp;argued that the inexpensive, factory-made goods flooding the markets had a negative effect on both those who made them and those who consumed them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ruskin and others believed that mechanized factory production deprived workers of the personal satisfaction and creativity involved in designing and making an object entirely with one&rsquo;s own hands. &nbsp;They also believed that people who bought these goods were surrounding themselves with soulless objects that lacked aesthetic value.&nbsp;Thus, their domestic environments were missing the elements of spirituality and refinement that produce healthy, well-rounded citizens. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This was a particular concern in the age of the Victorian &ldquo;cult of domesticity,&rdquo; which emphasized the home as a morally uplifting respite from the negative influences of city life. &nbsp;Ruskin and his followers advocated a return to the medieval guild model in which artisans were responsible for handcrafting their works from beginning to end. This&nbsp;produced&nbsp;a sense of pride in the worker and guaranteed&nbsp;quality products for the consumer. &nbsp;William Morris was strongly influenced by Ruskin&rsquo;s writing and also dedicated to social reform.</p>\n"

"<h3>Craftsmanship and&nbsp;community</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Red House was the home he designed in Bexleyheath, a southeastern suburb of London, England, &nbsp;for his family with the assistance of Philip Webb. Webb and Morris met while working in London for the architect G. E. Street. &nbsp;Webb would go on to be one of the major architects of the Gothic Revival movement in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris wanted the house to be a place that reflected his ideals and celebrated art, craftsmanship, and community. &nbsp;Morris and Webb collaborated to make the house&rsquo;s architecture and interior design merge into a unified whole. This&nbsp;would provide the appropriate atmosphere to foster domestic harmony and instill creative energy in its inhabitants and visitors. &nbsp;It was the first home built according to the principles of fine artistry and utility that became the hallmark of the design firm Morris founded with Webb in 1861, as well as the emerging Arts and Crafts movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris and Webb designed the house in a simplified Tudor Gothic style. The features of this style include&nbsp;historicizing elements such as steep roofs, prominent chimneys, cross gables, and exposed-beam ceilings, all&nbsp;present in Red House. &nbsp;Morris was influenced by Ruskin and other theorists who saw the Gothic as a time of perfection in the craft and building trades, as well as a period of great faith and belief in human dignity. &nbsp;They also viewed the Gothic as a more suitable style for&nbsp;Northern Europe because it&nbsp;originated in France, a northern country, as opposed to the classical forms of ancient Greece and Rome. &nbsp;For Morris and Webb, the adoption of a specifically English form of Gothic architecture seemed natural and appropriate to the site.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>A medieval ideal</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The use of exposed red brick for the exterior both gave the house its name and reveals the innate beauty of the construction materials. Morris and Webb valued the specific beauty of natural materials, which they saw as far superior to and healthier than industrially produced materials. Red House is L-shaped, with the rooms laid out for maximum efficiency and clarity. The L-shaped plan also allows the house to embrace the gardens as a part of the domestic sphere, as well as creates an asymmetry that is typical of traditional Gothic structures that were built over long periods of time. The concept of an integral whole extended to the interior design as well.&nbsp;Webb, Morris, his wife, Jane, and the painter Edward Burne-Jones all worked together to design everything in the home, from the wallpaper to the stained-glass windows to the built-in cabinets and furniture, so that all celebrated the beauty of nature and the medieval guild ideal.</p>\n"

"<p>Red House was the home he designed in Bexleyheath, a southeastern suburb of London, England, &nbsp;for his family with the assistance of Philip Webb. Webb and Morris met while working in London for the architect G. E. Street. &nbsp;Webb would go on to be one of the major architects of the Gothic Revival movement in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris wanted the house to be a place that reflected his ideals and celebrated art, craftsmanship, and community. &nbsp;Morris and Webb collaborated to make the house&rsquo;s architecture and interior design merge into a unified whole. This&nbsp;would provide the appropriate atmosphere to foster domestic harmony and instill creative energy in its inhabitants and visitors. &nbsp;It was the first home built according to the principles of fine artistry and utility that became the hallmark of the design firm Morris founded with Webb in 1861, as well as the emerging Arts and Crafts movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris and Webb designed the house in a simplified Tudor Gothic style. The features of this style include&nbsp;historicizing elements such as steep roofs, prominent chimneys, cross gables, and exposed-beam ceilings, all&nbsp;present in Red House. &nbsp;Morris was influenced by Ruskin and other theorists who saw the Gothic as a time of perfection in the craft and building trades, as well as a period of great faith and belief in human dignity. &nbsp;They also viewed the Gothic as a more suitable style for&nbsp;Northern Europe because it&nbsp;originated in France, a northern country, as opposed to the classical forms of ancient Greece and Rome. &nbsp;For Morris and Webb, the adoption of a specifically English form of Gothic architecture seemed natural and appropriate to the site.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>A medieval ideal</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The use of exposed red brick for the exterior both gave the house its name and reveals the innate beauty of the construction materials. Morris and Webb valued the specific beauty of natural materials, which they saw as far superior to and healthier than industrially produced materials. Red House is L-shaped, with the rooms laid out for maximum efficiency and clarity. The L-shaped plan also allows the house to embrace the gardens as a part of the domestic sphere, as well as creates an asymmetry that is typical of traditional Gothic structures that were built over long periods of time. The concept of an integral whole extended to the interior design as well.&nbsp;Webb, Morris, his wife, Jane, and the painter Edward Burne-Jones all worked together to design everything in the home, from the wallpaper to the stained-glass windows to the built-in cabinets and furniture, so that all celebrated the beauty of nature and the medieval guild ideal.</p>\n"

"<p>Unfortunately Morris had to sell Red House in 1865 due to financial difficulties. &nbsp;It remained a private residence until 2003, when it was acquired by the National Trust of Great Britain. The architecture of Red House has not been significantly altered, but most of the original furniture is gone and some of the original wall paintings have been covered with modern reproductions of wallpaper Morris produced after he established his design company with Webb and like-minded colleagues. Red House&nbsp;now functions as a museum and is open to the public.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Completed in four months, from October 1800 to January 1801, it signals the dawning of a new century. After a decade of terror and uncertainty following the Revolution, France was emerging as a great power once more. At the heart of this revival, of course, was General Napoleon Bonaparte who, in 1799, had staged an uprising against the revolutionary government (a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat), installed himself as First Consul, and effectively become the most powerful man in France (a few years later he will declare himself emperor).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In May 1800 he led his troops across the Alps in a military campaign against the Austrians which ended in their defeat in June at the Battle of Marengo. It is this achievement the painting commemorates. The portrait was commissioned by Charles IV, then King of Spain, &nbsp;to be hung in a gallery of paintings of other great military leaders housed in the Royal Palace in Madrid.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Napoleon and the Portrait</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Famously, Napoleon offered David little support in executing the painting. Refusing to sit for it, he argued that: &ldquo;Nobody knows if the portraits of the great men resemble them, it is enough that their genius lives there.&rdquo; All David had to work from was an earlier portrait and the uniform Napoleon had worn at Marengo. One of David&rsquo;s sons stood in for him, dressed up in the uniform and perched on top of a ladder. This probably accounts for the youthful physique of the figure.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Napoleon, however, was not entirely divorced from the process. He was the one who settled on the idea of an equestrian portrait: &ldquo;calme sur un cheval fougueux&rdquo; (calm on a fiery horse), were his instructions to the artist. And David duly obliged. What better way, after all, to demonstrate Napoleon&#39;s ability to to wield power with sound judgment and composure. The fact that Napoleon did not actually lead his troops over the Alps but followed a couple of days after them, travelling on a narrow path on the back of a mule is not the point!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Description</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many equestrian portraits, a genre favoured by royalty, <em>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</em> is a portrait of authority. Napoleon is pictured astride a rearing Arabian stallion. Before him to his left we see a mountain, while in the background, largely obscured by rocks, French troops haul along a large canon and further down the line fly the tricolore (the national flag of France) .&nbsp;</p>\n"

Taking the point further, if with that outstretched arm and billowing cloak, his body seems to echo the landscape, the reverse might equally hold true, that it is the landscape that echoes him, and is ultimately mastered by his will.

Significantly, he signs and dates <em>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</em> on the horse&rsquo;s breastplate, a device used to hold the saddle firmly in place. The breastplate also serves as a constraint, though, and given his later huge commissions, such as <em>The Coronation of Napoleon</em>, one wonders if David&rsquo;s creative genius was inhibited as a result of his hero&rsquo;s patronage.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Apart from the salon</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The group of artists who became known as the Impressionists did something ground-breaking&nbsp;in addition to painting&nbsp;their sketchy, light-filled canvases: they established their own exhibition. This may not seem like much in an era like ours, when art galleries are everywhere in major cities, but in Paris at this time, there was&nbsp;one official,&nbsp;state-sponsored&nbsp;exhibition&mdash;called the Salon&mdash;and very few art galleries devoted to&nbsp;the work of living artists. For most of the nineteenth century then,&nbsp;the Salon was the only way to exhibit your work (and therefore the only way to establish your reptutation and&nbsp;make a living as an artist). The works exhibited at the Salon were chosen by a jury&mdash;which could often be quite arbitrary. The artists we know today as Impressionists&mdash;Claude Monet,&nbsp;August Renoir,&nbsp;Edgar Degas,&nbsp;Berthe Morisot, Alfred Sisley (and several others)&mdash;could not afford to wait for France to accept their work. They all had experienced rejection by the Salon jury in recent years and felt that waiting an entire year between exhibitions wastoo long. They needed to show their work and they wanted to sell it.</p>\n"

"<p>The artists pooled their money, rented a studio that&nbsp;belonged to the&nbsp;photographer Nadar, and set a date for their first collective exhibition. They called themselves the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Printmakers and their first show&nbsp;opened at about the same time as the annual Salon in&nbsp;May 1874.

"<h3>Apart from the salon</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The group of artists who became known as the Impressionists did something ground-breaking&nbsp;in addition to painting&nbsp;their sketchy, light-filled canvases: they esetablished their own exhibition. This may not seem like much in an era like ours, when art galleries are everywhere in major cities, but in Paris at this time, there was&nbsp;one official,&nbsp;state-sponsored&nbsp;exhibition&mdash;called the Salon&mdash;and very few art galleries devoted to&nbsp;the work of living artists. For most of the nineteenth century then,&nbsp;the Salon was the only way to exhibit your work (and therefore the only way to establish your reptutation and&nbsp;make a living as an artist). The works exhibited at the Salon were chosen by a jury&mdash;which could often be quite arbitrary. The artists we know today as Impressionists&mdash;Claude Monet,&nbsp;August Renoir,&nbsp;Edgar Degas,&nbsp;Berthe Morisot, Alfred Sisley (and several others)&mdash;could not afford to wait for France to accept their work. They all had experienced rejection by the Salon jury in recent years and felt that waiting an entire year between exhibitions wastoo long. They needed to show their work and they wanted to sell it.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Background</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Place de la Madeleine had been consecrated as a site devoted to Mary Magdalene in 1182. During the period known as the First Republic (1792-1804), following the French Revolution, the foundations of earlier sacred buildings were removed and discussions were had as to what to do with the space. As France had been de-Christianized during the Revolution a civic rather than a religious function for the building was decided upon; various suggestions were put forward including a new site for the Bank of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Considerations were brought to a halt, however, when in 1804 Napoleon crowned himself Emperor. What followed was one of the most ambitious propaganda programs of the nineteenth century. As well as looting works from the world&rsquo;s finest collections to display in the newly refurbished Louvre, renamed the Mus&eacute;e Napoleon, some of the greatest artists and sculptors of the age were recruited to exalt the new emperor. It was only fitting that Napoleon would turn to architects, too, to realize his vision of an imperial capital city. Three monuments of particular note were constructed with this end in view: the Arc de Triomphe, the Vend&ocirc;me Column and the church at the Place de la Madeleine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It was never Napoleon&rsquo;s intention to build a church for Mary Magdalene, though. For him the new building would stand as a Temple to the Glory of the Army, and by that, of course, he meant his own imperial army, that well-organized band of marauders who, having defeated the Austrians in the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, had managed to supplicate a great swathe of Europe. To celebrate their achievement, a competition to select the best design for the Temple was established in 1806 to be judged by to a jury selected from the Imperial Academy. As it turned out, the jury proved academic in more ways than one, their opinions counting for little as, despite their disapproval, Napoleon opted for the designs of one Pierre-Alexandre Vignon (1763-1828).&nbsp;</p>\n"

Lacking Ledoux&rsquo;s more visionary character, however, Vignon&rsquo;s design for the exterior was basically a scaled up version of the&nbsp;<em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;in N&icirc;mes.</p>\n"

These fluted Roman Corinthian columns &ndash; there are fifty-two of them in all &ndash; rise up to a staggering twenty meters and encompass the entire structure. The entablature they support is embellished with a bipartite architrave surmounted by a frieze with a decoration of garlands and putti.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb76385af927a4fd7fdf431c08373c85d136c113.gif\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Entablature (detail), <em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;c. 16 B.C.E (N&icirc;mes, Provence)</span></span>While not quite so ornate, the features, in the main, reproduce those found on the Roman temple. The dentils, those repeated teeth-like blocks that ornament the cornice, seem bulkier, however, lending the fa&ccedil;ade a somewhat more austere character.&nbsp;While the exterior bears the hallmarks of Napoleonic propaganda, evoking the grandeur of Imperial Rome, after his fall, the Bourbon Restoration (1814-30) sought to revive the relationship between church and state.&nbsp;For this reason it was decided, as the temple was still incomplete, to return to the pre-Revolution purpose of the building project, namely to construct a church dedicated to Mary Magdalene.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Pediment Frieze</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In contrast to the Napoleonic design of the temple, the pediment frieze, designed by Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire in 1829, is a masterpiece of Bourbon Restoration propaganda. The subject is&nbsp;<em>The Last Judgment</em>, a centuries-old motif found on relief sculptures above the doors of countless churches and cathedrals. While Lemaire largely follows iconographical convention, depicting Christ the Judge at the center of the composition and on His right the archangel Gabriel with his horn announcing the Day of Judgment and on His left the archangel Michael wielding the sword of justice, it is in the figure of Mary Magdalene kneeling at the foot of Christ that the underlying message of the sculpture is revealed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Mary Magdalene has very strong connections with France. According to tradition she&nbsp;was among the first Christian proselytizers:&nbsp;after the crucifixion she journeyed to Provence from the Holy Land converting the French to Christianity. She is also, of course&mdash;albeit wrongly&mdash;often portrayed in art and in literature as a repentant prostitute, as indeed she is here; notice, for example the contrast between the virtuous female figures to the right whose bodies are concealed and her own state of semi-nakedness.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0b0c730ef2ae1c0455d6f4db9cfba43cc5205e73.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Henri Lemaire, <em>Last Judgment </em>pediment,&nbsp;Church of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>, 1829-42, Place de la Madeleine (Paris)</span></span>As well as a straightforward Last Judgment, the inclusion of the repentant Magdalene figure has led some to read the frieze as a political allegory in which the damned stand for those who had been involved in the Revolution and who, in the eyes of the restored monarchist regime, were effectively traitors. Given that such a large portion of the French people fell into this category, rather than condemn and punish them, they were called upon to repent of their sins, as Magdalene had done, before being embraced back into the arms of the ruling establishment.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Unlike in England or America say, where public building programmes such as the British Museum or the Capitol exhibit a single-minded confidence, state architecture in France at this period reflects the country&rsquo;s complex and conflicted political landscape, made up of republicans who had fought for the Revolution, of imperialists who had followed Napoleon and of monarchists who were loyal to the king. The unsettled look and feel of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>&nbsp;is a prime example of this tendency, particularly so in the striking contrast between the outside of the building and its interior.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Interior</h3>\n"

"On entering the church we are faced with a surprisingly opulent spectacle, especially given the severity of its exterior. Standing in the narthex (porch) of the church, we look up to see a coffered barrel vault, lavishly gilded like the rest of the interior. Above the door is the famous pipe organ on which such composers as Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns and Gabriel Faur&eacute; played.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Turning around and walking down the long nave, one passes under three large domes, supported by pendentives (triangular sections of vaulting between the rim of a dome and the arches that support it), decorated with colossal relief figures. Each dome is coffered and has a glazed oculus allowing in light, features that obviously recall the Pantheon.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It is a curious painting, completed during the July Monarchy (1830-48) when the liberal king, Louis-Philippe, struggled to reconcile those contending political factions. That Napoleon had in fact a very low opinion of the church and sought to limit its powers in France is, of course, neither here nor there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In this world the revolutionaries, like Magdalene, have repented, Napoleon is shown to have saved the day and the church and by association the Catholic monarchy are restored to their rightful place in the natural order of things. Sadly, for Louis-Philippe, it is a wildly optimistic reimagining of history, one that in the end &ndash; as the violent events of 1848, the Year of Revolutions, demonstrated &ndash; would prove ill founded.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Background</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Place de la Madeleine had been consecrated as a site devoted to Mary Magdalene in 1182. During the period known as the First Republic (1792-1804), following the French Revolution, the foundations of earlier sacred buildings were removed and discussions were had as to what to do with the space. As France had been de-Christianized during the Revolution a civic rather than a religious function for the building was decided upon; various suggestions were put forward including a new site for the Bank of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Considerations were brought to a halt, however, when in 1804 Napoleon crowned himself Emperor. What followed was one of the most ambitious propaganda programs of the nineteenth century. As well as looting works from the world&rsquo;s finest collections to display in the newly refurbished Louvre, renamed the Mus&eacute;e Napoleon, some of the greatest artists and sculptors of the age were recruited to exalt the new emperor. It was only fitting that Napoleon would turn to architects, too, to realize his vision of an imperial capital city. Three monuments of particular note were constructed with this end in view: the Arc de Triomphe, the Vend&ocirc;me Column and the church at the Place de la Madeleine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It was never Napoleon&rsquo;s intention to build a church for Mary Magdalene, though. For him the new building would stand as a Temple to the Glory of the Army, and by that, of course, he meant his own imperial army, that well-organized band of marauders who, having defeated the Austrians in the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, had managed to supplicate a great swathe of Europe. To celebrate their achievement, a competition to select the best design for the Temple was established in 1806 to be judged by to a jury selected from the Imperial Academy. As it turned out, the jury proved academic in more ways than one, their opinions counting for little as, despite their disapproval, Napoleon opted for the designs of one Pierre-Alexandre Vignon (1763-1828).&nbsp;</p>\n"

Lacking Ledoux&rsquo;s more visionary character, however, Vignon&rsquo;s design for the exterior was basically a scaled up version of the&nbsp;<em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;in N&icirc;mes.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Exterior​</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c0797eb8987cbad9e3e3ca0401b7d6f8871ed801.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Entablature (detail),,&nbsp;Church of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>, 1807-45&nbsp;(Paris)</span></span>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;though, the portico of La Madeleine has eight columns rather than six. These fluted Roman Corinthian columns &ndash; there are fifty-two of them in all &ndash; rise up to a staggering twenty meters and encompass the entire structure. The entablature they support is embellished with a bipartite architrave surmounted by a frieze with a decoration of garlands and putti.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb76385af927a4fd7fdf431c08373c85d136c113.gif\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Entablature (detail), <em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;c. 16 B.C.E (N&icirc;mes, Provence)</span></span>While not quite so ornate, the features, in the main, reproduce those found on the Roman temple. The dentils, those repeated teeth-like blocks that ornament the cornice, seem bulkier, however, lending the fa&ccedil;ade a somewhat more austere character.&nbsp;While the exterior bears the hallmarks of Napoleonic propaganda, evoking the grandeur of Imperial Rome, after his fall, the Bourbon Restoration (1814-30) sought to revive the relationship between church and state.&nbsp;For this reason it was decided, as the temple was still incomplete, to return to the pre-Revolution purpose of the building project, namely to construct a church dedicated to Mary Magdalene.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Pediment Frieze</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In contrast to the Napoleonic design of the temple, the pediment frieze, designed by Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire in 1829, is a masterpiece of Bourbon Restoration propaganda. The subject is&nbsp;<em>The Last Judgment</em>, a centuries-old motif found on relief sculptures above the doors of countless churches and cathedrals. While Lemaire largely follows iconographical convention, depicting Christ the Judge at the center of the composition and on His right the archangel Gabriel with his horn announcing the Day of Judgment and on His left the archangel Michael wielding the sword of justice, it is in the figure of Mary Magdalene kneeling at the foot of Christ that the underlying message of the sculpture is revealed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Mary Magdalene has very strong connections with France. Among the first Christian proselytizers, after the crucifixion she journeyed to Provence from the Holy Land converting the French to Christianity. She is also, of course &ndash; albeit wrongly &ndash; often portrayed in art and in literature as a repentant prostitute, as indeed she is here; notice, for example the contrast between the virtuous female figures to the right whose bodies are concealed and her own state of semi-nakedness.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0b0c730ef2ae1c0455d6f4db9cfba43cc5205e73.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Henri Lemaire, <em>Last Judgment </em>pediment,&nbsp;Church of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>, 1829-42, Place de la Madeleine (Paris)</span></span>As well as a straightforward Last Judgment, the inclusion of the repentant Magdalene figure has led some to read the frieze as a political allegory in which the damned stand for those who had been involved in the Revolution and who, in the eyes of the restored monarchist regime, were effectively traitors. Given that such a large portion of the French people fell into this category, rather than condemn and punish them, they were called upon to repent of their sins, as Magdalene had done, before being embraced back into the arms of the ruling establishment.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Unlike in England or America say, where public building programmes such as the British Museum or the Capitol exhibit a single-minded confidence, state architecture in France at this period reflects the country&rsquo;s complex and conflicted political landscape, made up of republicans who had fought for the Revolution, of imperialists who had followed Napoleon and of monarchists who were loyal to the king. The unsettled look and feel of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>&nbsp;is a prime example of this tendency, particularly so in the striking contrast between the outside of the building and its interior.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Interior</h3>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ccbc124e13377c553c06c2a2093e3a911e337583.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pierre-Alexandre Barth&eacute;l&eacute;my Vignon, completed by Jacques-Marie Huv&eacute;, interior (narthex) of the Church of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>, 1807-45, 108m long x 43 m, Place de la Madeleine (Paris)</span></span><br />\n"
"On entering the church we are faced with a surprisingly opulent spectacle, especially given the severity of its exterior. Standing in the narthex (porch) of the church, we look up to see a coffered barrel vault, lavishly gilded like the rest of the interior. Above the door is the famous pipe organ on which such composers as Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns and Gabriel Faur&eacute; played.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Turning around and walking down the long nave, one passes under three large domes, supported by pendentives (triangular sections of vaulting between the rim of a dome and the arches that support it), decorated with colossal relief figures. Each dome is coffered and has a glazed oculus allowing in light, features that obviously recall the Pantheon.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Three pairs of wide bays are thus created, each with pedimented niches supported by ionic columns that serve to form side altars.&nbsp;Far from the classical temple type the exterior would lead us to expect, architectural historians have compared the interior of the church to that of Roman baths; the triple cross-vaults of the Baths of Caracalla, for instance, may well have been in Vignon&rsquo;s mind when designing those domes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the north end is the semi-dome of the apse, under which sits the altar and behind it a wonderfully theatrical statue by Carlo Marochetti of Magdalene being lifted up by angels, a fine example of Romantic sculpture.</p>\n"

"<p>Beneath her is Napoleon in his coronation robes, positioned center stage, his figure directly aligned with Christ&rsquo;s.&nbsp;Facing him is Pope Pius VII, with whom he signed the Concordat of 1801, a document which reestablished the authority of the Catholic church in France after the Revolution and which is alluded to on the scroll the cardinal who stands behind Napoleon carries in his left hand.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is a curious painting, completed during the July Monarchy (1830-48) when the liberal king, Louis-Philippe, struggled to reconcile those contending political factions. That Napoleon had in fact a very low opinion of the church and sought to limit its powers in France is, of course, neither here nor there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In this world the revolutionaries, like Magdalene, have repented, Napoleon is shown to have saved the day and the church and by association the Catholic monarchy are restored to their rightful place in the natural order of things. Sadly, for Louis-Philippe, it is a wildly optimistic reimagining of history, one that in the end &ndash; as the violent events of 1848, the Year of Revolutions, demonstrated &ndash; would prove ill founded.</p>\n"

"<p><span>Despite the Holocaust, significant Jewish populations&nbsp;survived&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;Europe especially&nbsp;in Russia, the United Kingdom, and France while Jews in&nbsp;Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,&nbsp;Greece, Yugoslavia, Germany and Austria were reduced to a tiny fraction of their prewar numbers.&nbsp;Jews everywhere&nbsp;struggled to invent a&nbsp;new post-Holocaust identity. </span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Western European nations received substantial aid from the American government, and the Jewish populations in&nbsp;those areas relied on American Jewish organizations for help.&nbsp;The geographic centers of Hasidism in Eastern Europe were disproportionately destroyed during the Holocaust, but many sects continue to thrive on almost every continent. In 1948&nbsp;the United Nations unanimously voted for an independent State of Israel (the area was at that time under British administration).</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Aftermath</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the immediate aftermath of the war in Eastern Europe, the Soviets continued to downplay the role of race, as they had during the Holocaust, but while many Jews were devoted Communists, they were once again targeted as a suspicious people who could never truly be trusted comrades. Especially during the Soviet show trials in the 1950s and 1960s, Jews were purged from government ranks and executed in public spaces. &nbsp;Although Stalin voted for the creation of Israel in 1948, these public show trials served as &ldquo;a form of public-pedagogy-by-example;&rdquo; the goal was to exemplify the fact that ethnic Jews did not belong among the Communist ranks, that they were not equal with others. Even in the secular Soviet Union, overt antisemitism persisted during the Cold War decades. Many Jews made their way out from behind the iron curtain toward Western Europe, Israel, or the United States.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>American Jews in the 1950s followed the patterns of other white ethnic immigrant populations. Many left large cities, focused on education, and joined counter-cultural movements in the late 1960s and 70s. American Jews often stood at the side of the oppressed, figuring prominently in the 1960s civil&nbsp;rights movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Jews in Islamic lands emigrated from North African and Middle Eastern countries between the late 1940s and late 1960s when pan-Arab nationalism became exclusively Muslim and precluded participation from others. These Jews immigrated to Israel, Western Europe, and the United States.&nbsp;In France, the Sephardic population from Algeria, Morrocco and Tunisia brought new religious life and diverse customs to a community that&nbsp;was struggling after the trauma of World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish identity now</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the modern world, Jewish identity can seem scattered, confusing, and boundless. In the United States, Jews thrived in the postwar decades&nbsp;and several different movements gained popularity: Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist.&nbsp;In Europe and Israel, inspired by these American movements, a smaller fraction of progressive Jews have formed Liberal or other kinds of Judaism. From the 1990s to the present, some American Jews have joined in a worldwide trend toward religious extremism. &nbsp;At the same time, the Reform movement has grown. The traditional separation between men and women has been broken down and women are now integrated into the rabbinate in non-Orthodox circles.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Art Spiegelman, the artist and author of <em>Maus</em>, recently reflected, &ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s become questionable to me is the way in which the Holocaust has become a central tenant of Jewishness in the late 20th century&hellip;. So that people see it as a Jewish problem and not a world problem.&rdquo; &nbsp;The omnipresence of Holocaust education within the Jewish community combined with a sort of alienation from tradition, made the Holocaust into the unifying agent that brought Jews together. In the twenty-first century, young Jews have pushed against the Holocaust as the defining feature of their Jewishness and have sought out alternative ways to express their connections to Judaism. Jewish film, music, and cultural festivals abound, attracting Jewish and non-Jewish audiences. The largest such festival occurs annually in Poland and draws tens of thousands from across the globe&mdash;that this festival takes place in the country where the greatest number of Jews were massacred during the Holocaust, signals a turn away from that dark period as the benchmark of Jewish identity and toward new forms of Jewish expression.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One popular joke says that Jews believe in &ldquo;at most&rdquo; one God. While monotheism is an important feature of Judaism, some of the greatest Rabbis from the Talmud have atheist tendencies, even as they espouse the centrality of Halakhah. As the scholar Shaye J.D. Cohen has written, &ldquo;Jewishness, like most&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;other identities, is imagined; it has no empirical objective, verifiable reality to which we can point and over which we can exclaim, &lsquo;This is it!&rsquo; &nbsp;Jewishness is in the mind.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Lacking any unifying authority, doctrine, or practice, Judaism is highly diverse and cannot be pared down to any singular concept. Instead, a set of features like common texts, a shared history, and the rhythms of religious Jewish life can help us understand a religion shaped as much by its ancient origins as its contemporary disjointedness.</p>\n"

"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b35b3f63c6baecd48e43e2f0cda0d99dad2a81fe.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Anselm Kiefer, <em>Shulamite [Sulamith]</em>, 1983, oil, emulsion, woodcut, shellac, acrylic, and straw on canvas, 541 x 368.3 cm (Doris and Donald Fisher Collection). &copy; Anselm Kiefer, courtesy of the artist. &quot;Born in Germany just months shy of the end of World War II, Anselm Kiefer came of age in the late 1960s when the silence surrounding the crimes of the Nazi regime was ruptured by a vocal younger generation horrified by their collective German &ldquo;past,&rdquo; struggling to reconcile such shame and redefine what it meant to be German in a post-Nazi world.&quot; &mdash;Rebecca Taylor</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Despite the Holocaust, significant Jewish populations&nbsp;survived&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;Europe especially&nbsp;in Russia, the United Kingdom, and France while Jews in&nbsp;Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,&nbsp;Greece, Yugoslavia, Germany and Austria were reduced to a tiny fraction of their prewar numbers.&nbsp;Jews everywhere&nbsp;struggled to invent a&nbsp;new post-Holocaust identity. </span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Western European nations received substantial aid from the American government, and the Jewish populations in&nbsp;those areas relied on American Jewish organizations for help.&nbsp;The geographic centers of Hasidism in Eastern Europe were disproportionately destroyed during the Holocaust, but many sects continue to thrive on almost every continent. In 1948&nbsp;the United Nations unanimously voted for an independent State of Israel (the area was at that time under British administration).</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Aftermath</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the immediate aftermath of the war in Eastern Europe, the Soviets continued to downplay the role of race, as they had during the Holocaust, but while many Jews were devoted Communists, they were once again targeted as a suspicious people who could never truly be trusted comrades. Especially during the Soviet show trials in the 1950s and 1960s, Jews were purged from government ranks and executed in public spaces. &nbsp;Although Stalin voted for the creation of Israel in 1948, these public show trials served as &ldquo;a form of public-pedagogy-by-example;&rdquo; the goal was to exemplify the fact that ethnic Jews did not belong among the Communist ranks, that they were not equal with others. Even in the secular Soviet Union, overt antisemitism persisted during the Cold War decades. Many Jews made their way out from behind the iron curtain toward Western Europe, Israel, or the United States.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>American Jews in the 1950s followed the patterns of other white ethnic immigrant populations. Many left large cities, focused on education, and joined counter-cultural movements in the late 1960s and 70s. American Jews often stood at the side of the oppressed, figuring prominently in the 1960s civil&nbsp;rights movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Jews in Islamic lands emigrated from North African and Middle Eastern countries between the late 1940s and late 1960s when pan-Arab nationalism became exclusively Muslim and precluded participation from others. These Jews immigrated to Israel, Western Europe, and the United States.&nbsp;In France, the Sephardic population from Algeria, Morrocco and Tunisia brought new religious life and diverse customs to a community that&nbsp;was struggling after the trauma of World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish identity now</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the modern world, Jewish identity can seem scattered, confusing, and boundless. In the United States, Jews thrived in the postwar decades&nbsp;and several different movements gained popularity: Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist.&nbsp;In Europe and Israel, inspired by these American movements, a smaller fraction of progressive Jews have formed Liberal or other kinds of Judaism. From the 1990s to the present, some American Jews have joined in a worldwide trend toward religious extremism. &nbsp;At the same time, the Reform movement has grown. The traditional separation between men and women has been broken down and women are now integrated into the rabbinate in non-Orthodox circles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art Spiegelman, the artist and author of <em>Maus</em>, recently reflected, &ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s become questionable to me is the way in which the Holocaust has become a central tenant of Jewishness in the late 20th century&hellip;. So that people see it as a Jewish problem and not a world problem.&rdquo; &nbsp;The omnipresence of Holocaust education within the Jewish community combined with a sort of alienation from tradition, made the Holocaust into the unifying agent that brought Jews together. In the twenty-first century, young Jews have pushed against the Holocaust as the defining feature of their Jewishness and have sought out alternative ways to express their connections to Judaism. Jewish film, music, and cultural festivals abound, attracting Jewish and non-Jewish audiences. The largest such festival occurs annually in Poland and draws tens of thousands from across the globe&mdash;that this festival takes place in the country where the greatest number of Jews were massacred during the Holocaust, signals a turn away from that dark period as the benchmark of Jewish identity and toward new forms of Jewish expression.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One popular joke says that Jews believe in &ldquo;at most&rdquo; one God. While monotheism is an important feature of Judaism, some of the greatest Rabbis from the Talmud have atheist tendencies, even as they espouse the centrality of Halakhah. As the scholar Shaye J.D. Cohen has written, &ldquo;Jewishness, like most&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;other identities, is imagined; it has no empirical objective, verifiable reality to which we can point and over which we can exclaim, &lsquo;This is it!&rsquo; &nbsp;Jewishness is in the mind.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Lacking any unifying authority, doctrine, or practice, Judaism is highly diverse and cannot be pared down to any singular concept. Instead, a set of features like common texts, a shared history, and the rhythms of religious Jewish life can help us understand a religion shaped as much by its ancient origins as its contemporary disjointedness.</p>\n"

"<h3>Breaking postwar silence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Born in Germany just months shy of the end of World War II, Anselm Kiefer came of age in the late 1960s when the silence surrounding the crimes of the Nazi regime was ruptured by a vocal younger generation horrified by their collective German &ldquo;past,&rdquo; struggling to reconcile such shame and redefine what it meant to be German in a post-Nazi world.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For Kiefer, who had studied with the artists Peter Dreher in Karlsruhe and Joseph Beuys in Dusseldorf, painting became the arena to vocalize and elucidate his contempt for the Nazis and their reprehensible legacy, instilling every brush stroke with palpable rage, grief, and shame. In the 1970s, Kiefer developed a signature style that was influenced in part by the Neo-expressionist style of Georg Baselitz, but also by his teacher Beuys, particularly Beuys&rsquo;s tendency to use commonplace materials, such as fat and felt within his artistic practice. Kiefer augmented his thick layers of impasto with lead, glass, straw, wood, dried flowers, and more, yielding highly textured, viscous surfaces. As his list of materials grew, so too did the scale of his canvases, which though large and formidable, felt ephemeral and fragile as a result of the materials he utilized.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A thick impasto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>All of the canonical elements of Kiefer&rsquo;s work are present in <em>Shulamite</em>&mdash;a thick impasto resulting from a hardened mixture of oil, acrylic, emulsion, and shellac; a brittle, textured surface infused with commonplace materials (in this case, straw and ash); mythological or biblical references (Shulamite refers to the heroine in the Song of Solomon); a literary reference (Celan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Death Fugue&rdquo;); and a historical subject or location (a Nazi Memorial Hall in Berlin).</p>\n"

Kiefer transformed architecture meant to honor Nazi heros into a memorial for their victims.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Emotional honesty</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Comparisons to Jackson Pollock in terms of both scale and expressive, gestural style are understandable, but for me Kiefer&rsquo;s paint handling is even more reminiscent of Vincent van Gogh, in terms of raw beauty and emotional honesty. Just as van Gogh&rsquo;s paint can transport me into the Dutch or French countryside and fill my nose with the smell of fresh sunflowers or irises, so too can Kiefer transport me to another place in time and space&mdash;but rather than a hayfield in Holland it is the dark abyss of a concentration camp with the stomach-churning smell of burning flesh sullying the air.</p>\n"

"<h3>El Dorado</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries Europeans were dazzled by the legend of a lost city of gold in South America. The truth behind this myth is fascinating. El Dorado&ndash;literally &ldquo;the golden one&rdquo;&ndash;actually refers to the ritual that took place at Lake Guatavita, near modern Bogot&aacute;. The newly elected leader, covered in powdered gold, dived into the lake and emerged as the new chief of the Muisca people who lived in the central highlands of present-day Colombia&#39;s Eastern Range.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mask with nose ornament, c. 500 B.C.E.–1600 C.E., possibly Yotoco or late Quimbaya, gold alloy, 15.5 x 18 cm © The Trustees of the British Museum.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0efa9e4009c7139f801c6107db2651c32d15fe1f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Mask with Nose Ornament</em>, c. 500 B.C.E.&ndash;1600 C.E., gold alloy, 15.5 x 18 cm, Quimbaya &nbsp;&copy; The Trustees of the British Museum.<br />\n"
"This spectacular hammered mask with a dangling nose ornament would probably have been placed on top of the face of a funerary bundle &ndash; the wrapped body of the deceased&mdash;transforming him into an ancestor and semi-divine figure.</span></span>The Muisca, Quimbaya, Calima, Tairona, Tolima and Zen&uacute; chiefdoms in ancient Colombia used gold to fashion some of the most visually dramatic and sophisticated works of art found anywhere in the Americas before European contact. Although gold was not valued as currency in pre-Hispanic Colombia, it had great symbolic meaning. It was one way the elite could publicly assert their rank and semi-divine status, both in life and in death.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>More than just gold</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Objects that seem at first glance made of gold are more complex and are in fact made of metal alloys. In most instances they combine, in different degrees, gold, some natural occurring silver, and copper, a combination known as tumbaga. These metals were symbolically charged in pre-Hispanic times, being associated with the sun and the moon respectively. Their combination produced a microcosm, a balance between opposites in the rendering of each object.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The creation of alloys also allowed for differences in color, ranging from reddish to golden tones. Each object had its own particular color, shine and finish thanks to the mastery and skills of the artists that produced them. Some even show contrasting colors in the same object, producing beautiful patterns and details.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Hammering and casting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Small ingots of tumbaga, in the shape of round buttons, were crafted into unique objects either by hammering or casting them (or by a combination of both techniques). Ancient Colombian artists mastered both techniques to an unprecedented degree, creating exceptional works of art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Hammering metal was a delicate process. Metal becomes easily brittle when hammered and they have to be repeatedly cooled and dipped in water before the final form is achieved. The thin sheets of gold were then cut, decorated (for example by repouss&eacute;) or joined by clipping or folding several sheets together.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, it was the casting of metals that was developed most in ancient Colombia.

"<h3>El Dorado</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries Europeans were dazzled by the legend of a lost city of gold in South America. The truth behind this myth is fascinating. El Dorado&ndash;literally &ldquo;the golden one&rdquo;&ndash;actually refers to the ritual that took place at Lake Guatavita, near modern Bogot&aacute;. The newly elected leader, covered in powdered gold, dived into the lake and emerged as the new chief of the Muisca people who lived in the central highlands of present-day Colombia&#39;s Eastern Range.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mask with nose ornament, c. 500 B.C.E.–1600 C.E., possibly Yotoco or late Quimbaya, gold alloy, 15.5 x 18 cm © The Trustees of the British Museum.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0efa9e4009c7139f801c6107db2651c32d15fe1f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Mask with Nose Ornament</em>, c. 500 B.C.E.&ndash;1600 C.E., gold alloy, 15.5 x 18 cm, Quimbaya &nbsp;&copy; The Trustees of the British Museum.<br />\n"
"This spectacular hammered mask with a dangling nose ornament would probably have been placed on top of the face of a funerary bundle &ndash; the wrapped body of the deceased&mdash;transforming him into an ancestor and semi-divine figure.</span></span>The Muisca, Quimbaya, Calima, Tairona, Tolima and Zen&uacute; chiefdoms in ancient Colombia used gold to fashion some of the most visually dramatic and sophisticated works of art found anywhere in the Americas before European contact. Although gold was not valued as currency in pre-Hispanic Colombia, it had great symbolic meaning. It was one way the elite could publicly assert their rank and semi-divine status, both in life and in death.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>More than just gold</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Objects that seem at first glance made of gold are more complex and are in fact made of metal alloys. In most instances they combine, in different degrees, gold, some natural occurring silver, and copper, a combination known as tumbaga. These metals were symbolically charged in pre-Hispanic times, being associated with the sun and the moon respectively. Their combination produced a microcosm, a balance between opposites in the rendering of each object.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The creation of alloys also allowed for differences in color, ranging from reddish to golden tones. Each object had its own particular color, shine and finish thanks to the mastery and skills of the artists that produced them. Some even show contrasting colors in the same object, producing beautiful patterns and details.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Hammering and casting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Small ingots of tumbaga, in the shape of round buttons, were crafted into unique objects either by hammering or casting them (or by a combination of both techniques). Ancient Colombian artists mastered both techniques to an unprecedented degree, creating exceptional works of art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Hammering metal was a delicate process. Metal becomes easily brittle when hammered and they have to be repeatedly cooled and dipped in water before the final form is achieved. The thin sheets of gold were then cut, decorated (for example by repouss&eacute;) or joined by clipping or folding several sheets together.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, it was the casting of metals that was developed most in ancient Colombia. Using the lost wax technique, artist modeled the final piece they wanted to achieve in beeswax (from stingless bees). Once the wax figure was finished it was covered in fine clay and charcoal, leaving pouring channels. The whole mold was fired and the melted wax poured out. Its place would be taken by molten metal, which cooled slowly as it solidified inside the mould. The mould was then broken and the final metal piece polished and finished.<br />\n"

This is an object that invites close looking to fully appreciate&nbsp;the process by which colorful beads animate the bag, making a dazzling object and showcasing remarkable technical skill.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What is a Bandolier Bag?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags&nbsp;are based on bags carried by European soldiers armed with rifles, who used the bags to store ammunition cartridges.&nbsp;While Bandolier Bags were made by different tribes and First Nations across the Great Lakes and Prairie regions, they differ in appearance. The stylistic differences are the result of personal preference as much&nbsp;contact with Europeans and Euro-Americans, goods acquired in trade, and travel.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, based in Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\n"

"\n"
"<p>The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in New York City&nbsp;has a wonderful example of a Bandolier Bag, most likely&nbsp;made by a Lenape artist (the Lenape are part of the Delaware tribe or First Nation, who lived along the Delaware River and parts of what is today New York State).&nbsp;[2]</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags (like this&nbsp;one) are often large in size and decorated with a wide array of colorful beads and ribbons. They are worn as a cross-body bag, with a thick strap crossing a person&rsquo;s chest to allow it to rest on the hip.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These bags were especially popular in the late nineteenth century in the Eastern or Woodlands region, which comprised parts of what is today Canada and the United States. The Woodlands area encompasses the Great Lakes Region and terrain east of the Mississippi River. This enormous geographic area has a long, complex history including the production of&nbsp;objects we today recognize as&nbsp;&ldquo;art,&rdquo;&nbsp;that date back more than 4,000 years.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Map: the Eastern Woodlands extended roughly from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern Great Plains, and from the Great Lakes region to the Gulf of Mexico.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3e227b06a299936f0a28c91436bb8798f95399dd.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">The Eastern Woodlands (on the map above &quot;Northeast&quot; and &quot;Southeast&quot;)&nbsp;extended roughly from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern Great Plains, and from the Great Lakes region to the Gulf of Mexico.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags were created across this vast expanse of land, and the NMAI has examples from the Upper Great Lakes region and Oklahoma. Due to events and laws like the Indian Removal Act of 1830 (signed by President Andrew Jackson), the Lenape&nbsp;were forcibly removed from these ancestral lands and relocated to areas of Oklahoma,&nbsp;Wisconsin, and&nbsp;Ontario, Canada. Despite these traumatic relocations, tribes like the Lenape continued to create objects as they had in ancestral lands. Bandolier bags are one example of this continued artistic production.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Material&nbsp;and design</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: Wisconsin Historical Society)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9eb4a521e72465e3909c51906cb5778c437af655.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/exhibits/p2p/red/impressions.asp\">Wisconsin Historical Society</a>)</span></span>While men most commonly wore these bags, women created them. Initially, Bandolier&nbsp;Bags did not have a pocket, but were intended to complement men&rsquo;s ceremonial outfits. Men even wore more than one bag on occasion, dressing themselves in a rainbow of colors and patterns. Even those bags with pockets weren&rsquo;t necessarily always used to hold objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Women typically produced Bandolier Bags using trade cloth, made from cotton or wool. It is often possible to see the exposed unembroidered trade cloth underneath the cross-body strap. The NMAI bag (above) uses animal hide in addition to the cotton cloth, combining materials that had long been used among these groups (animal hides) with new materials (cotton trade cloth).&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beads and other materials were embroidered on the trade cloth and hide. The tiny glass beads, called seed beads, were acquired from European traders, and they were prized for their brilliant colors. Glass beads replaced porcupine quillwork, which had&nbsp;a longstanding history in this area. Before the use of glass beads, porcupine quills were acquired (carefully!), softened and dyed. Once they were malleable enough to bend, the quills were woven onto the surfaces of objects (especially&nbsp;clothing or other cloth&nbsp;goods like bags). Quillwork required different working techniques than embroidering with beads, so people adopted new methods for&nbsp;decorating the surfaces of bags, clothing, and other goods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Silk ribbons (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, based in Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/babde6866812c86d876263f6c7f2338b9fa5e318.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Silk ribbons (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span>In addition to glass beads, the NMAI bag is decorated with silk ribbons&mdash;also procured via trade with Europeans. Much like the glass beads, silk ribbons offered a new material with a greater variety of color choices. Looking at the NMAI bag, we can see that the&nbsp;artists attached strips of yellow, blue, red, and green ribbons, like tassels, to the ends of the straps, as well as longer orange ribbons that fall&nbsp;below the bottom of the bag. Before the introduction of ribbons, women would paint the surface of hides in addition to decorating the bags with&nbsp;quillwork. Ribbons afforded women the opportunity to produce more textural variation, and&nbsp;to expand the surface of the bags in new ways. Imagine wearing this bag: the bright colors would attract attention and the sparkle of the beads would reflect sunlight as the ribbons fluttered in the wind or moved as one walked.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Further animating the surface of the NMAI Bandolier Bag is a red wool fringe, capped with metal cones that attach to the bag&rsquo;s rectangular pouch. Like the ribbons and beads, the fringe and metal offered more colors and textures to the bag&rsquo;s surface.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Fringe (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, based in Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e4b068e0a7cef2d274de469a0f3d19cfadc1524d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Fringe (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe,&nbsp;Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The designs on the bag are abstracted and symmetrical. White beads act as contour lines to help make the designs&nbsp;more visible to the naked eye. On the cross-body strap, we see a design that branches in four directions. Yet notice how the artist has actually made each side slightly different. The left portion of the strap displays a light&nbsp;blue background, and the repeating form is more rounded, with softer edges. On the right side of the strap, the blue is darker,&nbsp;the framing&nbsp;pink and green is varied, and the repeating form displays more straight lines. The small size of seed beads allowed for more curvilinear designs than quillwork.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Strap (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, based in Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/be6c87bd077e54de0ede7af348995739aebb32c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Strap (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is possible that the&nbsp;contrasting colors&nbsp;represent&nbsp;the Celestial/Sky&nbsp;and Underworld realms.&nbsp;The abstracted designs on the sash may also be read in relation to the cosmos because they branch into four directions, which might relate to the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) and the division of the terrestrial (earthly) realm into four quadrants.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Prairie Style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The NMAI Bandolier Bag relates to a broader array of objects that demonstrate the Prairie Style.&nbsp;The artist of the&nbsp;NMAI Bandolier Bag&nbsp;borrowed from older Delaware traditions, as well as those of other&nbsp;native peoples after they were forcibly relocated. Another Bandolier bag in the NMAI collection (below), by an Anishnaabe artist, demonstrates the &ldquo;Prairie Style&rdquo; clearly in the upper section where&nbsp;a floral motif floats against a dark ground.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Bandolier Bag, Anishnaabe (Chippewa/Ojibwe), c. 1870, Upper Great Lakes, wool, cotton cloth, and glass beads. 87 x 26 cm (National Museum of the American IndianI, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7313c3f32913636aaffea251dd41ee1f695c62c9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Bandolier Bag, Anishnaabe (Chippewa/Ojibwe), c. 1870, Upper Great Lakes, wool, cotton cloth, and glass beads. 87 x 26 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"

The patterns could be either naturalistic flowers or abstract floral designs. A Sac and Fox&nbsp;breechcloth in the NMAI collection (left) is a clear example of the more abstract Prairie Style because the floral designs do not closely resemble flowers that you might see in nature&nbsp;(the Sacs or Sauks are an Eastern Woodlands group, the Fox tribe is closely related to them, and they are both&nbsp;centered in Oklahoma today, though&nbsp;there are Sac and Fox tribes in Iowa and Kansas as well).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Prairie Style&nbsp;is the result of peoples coming into contact with one another, particularly in the wake of removal from their ancestral homelands. Floral forms, combined with the use of ribbons and colorful glass beads, not only attest&nbsp;to the transformations in&nbsp;artistic production, but also testifies to the creativity of people as they adapted to new situations. Bandolier Bags, as well as other objects and clothing, helped to express group identities and social status. In the wake of forced removals and threats to traditional ways of life, objects like the NMAI Bandolier Bag demonstrate the resilience and continued creativity of groups like the Lenape.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Today</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags are still made and worn today&mdash;attesting to their rich and complex&nbsp;history and their continuing ceremonial and cultural functions. For example, when the NMAI opened a new museum in Washington, D.C., in 2004, Ojibwe men wore colorful Bandolier Bags during the opening festivities and ceremonies. Artists continue to innovate by creating new interpretations of Bandolier Bags. Maria Hupfield, who belongs to the Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada, and currently lives in Brooklyn, made a Bandolier Bag from gray felt&mdash;an industrial material transformed&nbsp;into something beautiful and historically significant.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Essay by Dr. Lauren Kilroy-Ewbank</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>[2] In the United States, it is more common to see the term &ldquo;Native American,&rdquo; &ldquo;Native,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Indigenous,&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;First Nations&rdquo; used more frequently in Canada.</p>\n"

"<p>Bandolier Bags were created across this vast expanse of land, and the NMAI has examples from the Upper Great Lakes region and Oklahoma. Due to events and laws like the Indian Removal Act of 1830 (signed by President Andrew Jackson), the Lenape&nbsp;were forcibly removed from these ancestral lands and relocated to areas of Oklahoma,&nbsp;Wisconsin, and&nbsp;Ontario, Canada. Despite these traumatic relocations, tribes like the Lenape continued to create objects as they had in ancestral lands. Bandolier bags are one example of this continued artistic production.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Material&nbsp;and design</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: Wisconsin Historical Society)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9eb4a521e72465e3909c51906cb5778c437af655.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/exhibits/p2p/red/impressions.asp\">Wisconsin Historical Society</a>)</span></span>While men most commonly wore these bags, women created them. Initially, Bandolier&nbsp;Bags did not have a pocket, but were intended to complement men&rsquo;s ceremonial outfits. Men even wore more than one bag on occasion, dressing themselves in a rainbow of colors and patterns. Even those bags with pockets weren&rsquo;t necessarily always used to hold objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Women typically produced Bandolier Bags using trade cloth, made from cotton or wool. It is often possible to see the exposed unembroidered trade cloth underneath the cross-body strap. The NMAI bag (above) uses animal hide in addition to the cotton cloth, combining materials that had long been used among these groups (animal hides) with new materials (cotton trade cloth).&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beads and other materials were embroidered on the trade cloth and hide. The tiny glass beads, called seed beads, were acquired from European traders, and they were prized for their brilliant colors. Glass beads replaced porcupine quillwork, which had&nbsp;a longstanding history in this area. Before the use of glass beads, porcupine quills were acquired (carefully!), softened and dyed. Once they were malleable enough to bend, the quills were woven onto the surfaces of objects (especially&nbsp;clothing or other cloth&nbsp;goods like bags). Quillwork required different working techniques than embroidering with beads, so people adopted new methods for&nbsp;decorating the surfaces of bags, clothing, and other goods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/babde6866812c86d876263f6c7f2338b9fa5e318.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Silk ribbons (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span>In addition to glass beads, the NMAI bag is decorated with silk ribbons&mdash;also procured via trade with Europeans. Much like the glass beads, silk ribbons offered a new material with a greater variety of color choices. Looking at the NMAI bag, we can see that the&nbsp;artists attached strips of yellow, blue, red, and green ribbons, like tassels, to the ends of the straps, as well as longer orange ribbons that fall&nbsp;below the bottom of the bag. Before the introduction of ribbons, women would paint the surface of hides in addition to decorating the bags with&nbsp;quillwork. Ribbons afforded women the opportunity to produce more textural variation, and&nbsp;to expand the surface of the bags in new ways. Imagine wearing this bag: the bright colors would attract attention and the sparkle of the beads would reflect sunlight as the ribbons fluttered in the wind or moved as one walked.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Further animating the surface of the NMAI Bandolier Bag is a red wool fringe, capped with metal cones that attach to the bag&rsquo;s rectangular pouch. Like the ribbons and beads, the fringe and metal offered more colors and textures to the bag&rsquo;s surface.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e4b068e0a7cef2d274de469a0f3d19cfadc1524d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Fringe (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe,&nbsp;Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The designs on the bag are abstracted and symmetrical. White beads act as contour lines to help make the designs&nbsp;more visible to the naked eye. On the cross-body strap, we see a design that branches in four directions. Yet notice how the artist has actually made each side slightly different. The left portion of the strap displays a light&nbsp;blue background, and the repeating form is more rounded, with softer edges. On the right side of the strap, the blue is darker,&nbsp;the framing&nbsp;pink and green is varied, and the repeating form displays more straight lines. The small size of seed beads allowed for more curvilinear designs than quillwork.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/be6c87bd077e54de0ede7af348995739aebb32c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Strap (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is possible that the&nbsp;contrasting colors&nbsp;represent&nbsp;the Celestial/Sky&nbsp;and Underworld realms.&nbsp;The abstracted designs on the sash may also be read in relation to the cosmos because they branch into four directions, which might relate to the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) and the division of the terrestrial (earthly) realm into four quadrants.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Prairie Style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The NMAI Bandolier Bag relates to a broader array of objects that demonstrate the Prairie Style.&nbsp;The artist of the&nbsp;NMAI Bandolier Bag&nbsp;borrowed from older Delaware traditions, as well as those of other&nbsp;native peoples after they were forcibly relocated. Another Bandolier bag in the NMAI collection (below), by an Anishnaabe artist, demonstrates the &ldquo;Prairie Style&rdquo; clearly in the upper section where&nbsp;a floral motif floats against a dark ground.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Bandolier Bag, Anishnaabe (Chippewa/Ojibwe), c. 1870, Upper Great Lakes, wool, cotton cloth, and glass beads. 87 x 26 cm (National Museum of the American IndianI, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7313c3f32913636aaffea251dd41ee1f695c62c9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Bandolier Bag, Anishnaabe (Chippewa/Ojibwe), c. 1870, Upper Great Lakes, wool, cotton cloth, and glass beads. 87 x 26 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Sac and Fox man’s breechcloth, c. 1880, Oklahoma, wool cloth, cotton cloth, glass bead/beads, cotton thread, 135 x 45 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b990dafe1e54df50d2ede68b60e05554be068c97.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sac and Fox man&rsquo;s breechcloth, c. 1880, Oklahoma, wool cloth, cotton, glass bead/beads, cotton thread, 135 x 45 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span>The Prairie Style&nbsp;used&nbsp;colorful glass beads&nbsp;fashioned in floral patterns. The patterns could be either naturalistic flowers or abstract floral designs. A Sac and Fox&nbsp;breechcloth in the NMAI collection (left) is a clear example of the more abstract Prairie Style because the floral designs do not closely resemble flowers that you might see in nature&nbsp;(the Sacs or Sauks are an Eastern Woodlands group, the Fox tribe is closely related to them, and they are both&nbsp;centered in Oklahoma today, though&nbsp;there are Sac and Fox tribes in Iowa and Kansas as well).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Prairie Style&nbsp;is the result of peoples coming into contact with one another, particularly in the wake of removal from their ancestral homelands. Floral forms, combined with the use of ribbons and colorful glass beads, not only attest&nbsp;to the transformations in&nbsp;artistic production, but also testifies to the creativity of people as they adapted to new situations. Bandolier Bags, as well as other objects and clothing, helped to express group identities and social status. In the wake of forced removals and threats to traditional ways of life, objects like the NMAI Bandolier Bag demonstrate the resilience and continued creativity of groups like the Lenape.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Today</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags are still made and worn today&mdash;attesting to their rich and complex&nbsp;history and their continuing ceremonial and cultural functions. For example, when the NMAI opened a new museum in Washington, D.C., in 2004, Ojibwe men wore colorful Bandolier Bags during the opening festivities and ceremonies. Artists continue to innovate by creating new interpretations of Bandolier Bags. Maria Hupfield, who belongs to the Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada, and currently lives in Brooklyn, made a Bandolier Bag from gray felt&mdash;an industrial material transformed&nbsp;into something beautiful and historically significant.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Essay by Dr. Lauren Kilroy-Ewbank</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>[1]&nbsp;Anishnaabe is the name for the ethnic group that comprises the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi First Nations around the Great Lakes. Due to relocations of the nineteenth century, many other groups like the Delaware and Dakota currently live on the same lands.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>[2] In the United States, it is more common to see the term &ldquo;Native American,&rdquo; &ldquo;Native,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Indigenous,&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;First Nations&rdquo; used more frequently in Canada.</p>\n"

"<h3>Appreciating &amp; understanding ancient Egyptian art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ancient Egyptian art must be viewed from the standpoint of the ancient Egyptians to understand it. The somewhat static, usually formal, strangely abstract, and often blocky nature of much Egyptian imagery has, at times, led to unfavorable comparisons with later, and much more &lsquo;naturalistic,&rsquo; Greek or Renaissance art. However, the art of the Egyptians served a vastly different purpose than that of these later cultures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Art not meant to be seen</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While today we marvel at the glittering treasures from the tomb of Tutankhamun, the sublime reliefs in New Kingdom tombs, and the serene beauty of Old Kingdom statuary, it is imperative to remember that the majority of these works were never intended to be seen&mdash;that was simply not their purpose.</p>\n"

"<h3>The function of Egyptian art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These images, whether statues or relief, were designed to benefit a divine or deceased recipient. Statuary provided a place for the recipient to manifest and receive the benefit of ritual action. Most statues show a formal frontality, meaning they are arranged straight ahead, because they were designed to face the ritual being performed before them. Many statues were also originally placed in recessed niches or other architectural settings&mdash;contexts that would make frontality their expected and natural mode.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Statuary, whether divine, royal, or elite, provided a kind of conduit for the spirit (or ka) of that being to interact with the terrestrial realm. Divine cult statues (few of which survive) were the subject of daily rituals of clothing, anointing, and perfuming with incense and were carried in processions for special festivals so that the people could &quot;see&quot; them (they were almost all entirely shrouded from view, but their &#39;presence&#39; was felt).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Royal and elite statuary served as intermediaries between the people and the gods. Family chapels with the statuary of a deceased forefather could serve as a sort of &#39;family temple.&#39; There were festivals in honor of the dead, where the family would come and eat in the chapel, offering food for the Afterlife, flowers (symbols of rebirth), and incense (the scent of which was considered divine). Preserved letters let us know that the deceased was actively petitioned for their assistance, both in this world and the next.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What we see in museums</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Generally, the works we see on display in museums were products of royal or elite workshops; these pieces fit best with our modern aesthetic and ideas of beauty. Most museum basements, however, are packed with hundreds (even thousands!) of other objects made for people of lower status&mdash;small statuary, amulets, coffins, and stelae (similar to modern tombstones) that are completely recognizable, but rarely displayed. These pieces generally show less quality in the workmanship; being oddly proportioned or poorly executed; they are less often considered &lsquo;art&rsquo; in the modern sense. However, these objects served the exact same function of providing benefit to their owners (and to the same degree of effectiveness), as those made for the elite.</p>\n"

"<h3>Modes of representation for three-dimensional art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Three-dimensional representations, while being quite formal, also aimed to reproduce the real-world&mdash;statuary of gods, royalty, and the elite was designed to convey an idealized version of that individual. Some aspects of &lsquo;naturalism&rsquo; were dictated by the material. Stone statuary, for example, was quite closed&mdash;with arms held close to the sides, limited positions, a strong back pillar that provided support, and with the fill spaces left between limbs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Painted wooden model of the deceased overseeing the counting of cattle in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo (Middle Kingdom).

Photo: Dr. Amy Calvert</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wood and metal statuary, in contrast, was more expressive&mdash;arms could be extended and hold separate objects, spaces between the limbs were opened to create a more realistic appearance, and more positions were possible. Stone, wood, and metal statuary of elite figures, however, all served the same functions and retained the same type of formalization and frontality. Only statuettes of lower status people displayed a wide range of possible actions, and these pieces were focused on the actions, which benefitted the elite owner, not the people involved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Modes of representation for two-dimensional art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two-dimensional art represented the world quite differently. Egyptian artists embraced the two-dimensional surface and attempted to provide the most representative aspects of each element in the scenes rather than attempting to create vistas that replicated the real world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each object or element in a scene was rendered from its most recognizable angle and these were then grouped together to create the whole. This is why images of people show their face, waist, and limbs in profile, but eye and shoulders frontally. These scenes are complex composite images that provide complete information about the various elements, rather than ones designed from a single viewpoint, which would not be as comprehensive in the data they conveyed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Painted sunk relief showing orderly registers in the Temple of Ramses II at Abydos (New Kingdom).

Photo: Dr. Amy Calvert</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Registers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Scenes were ordered in parallel lines, known as registers. These registers separate the scene as well as provide ground lines for the figures. Scenes without registers are unusual and were generally only used to specifically evoke chaos; battle and hunting scenes will often show the prey or foreign armies without groundlines. Registers were also used to convey information about the scenes&mdash;the higher up in the scene, the higher the status; overlapping figures imply that the ones underneath are further away, as are those elements that are higher within the register.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Hierarchy of scale</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Difference in scale was the most commonly used method for conveying hierarchy&mdash;the larger the scale of the figures, the more important they were. Kings were often shown at the same scale as deities, but both are shown larger than the elite and far larger than the average Egyptian.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Text and image</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Highly detailed raised relief hieroglyphs on the White Chapel of Senusret I at Karnak (Middle Kingdom). Photo: Dr Amy Calvert\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6dec7a9e285029649df3ba5f1a93695e2dbf4093.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Highly detailed raised relief hieroglyphs on the White Chapel of Senusret I at Karnak (Middle Kingdom). Photo: Dr Amy Calvert</span></span>Text accompanied almost all images. In statuary, identifying text will appear on the back pillar or base, and relief usually has captions or longer texts that complete and elaborate on the scenes. Hieroglyphs were often rendered as tiny works of art in themselves, even though these small pictures do not always stand for what they depict; many are instead phonetic sounds. Some, however, are logographic, meaning they stand for an object or concept.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lines blur between text and image in many cases. For instance, the name of a figure in the text on a statue will regularly omit the determinative (an unspoken sign at the end of a word that aids identification&ndash;for example, verbs of motion are followed by a pair of walking legs, names of men end with the image of a man, names of gods with the image of a seated god, etc.) at the end of the name. In these instances, the representation itself serves this function.</p>\n"

This is why images of people show their face, waist, and limbs in profile, but eye and shoulders frontally. These scenes are complex composite images that provide complete information about the various elements, rather than ones designed from a single viewpoint, which would not be as comprehensive in the data they conveyed.</p>\n"

"<h3>Registers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Scenes were ordered in parallel lines, known as registers. These registers separate the scene as well as provide ground lines for the figures. Scenes without registers are unusual and were generally only used to specifically evoke chaos; battle and hunting scenes will often show the prey or foreign armies without groundlines. Registers were also used to convey information about the scenes&mdash;the higher up in the scene, the higher the status; overlapping figures imply that the ones underneath are further away, as are those elements that are higher within the register.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Hierarchy of scale</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Difference in scale was the most commonly used method for conveying hierarchy&mdash;the larger the scale of the figures, the more important they were. Kings were often shown at the same scale as deities, but both are shown larger than the elite and far larger than the average Egyptian.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Text and image</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Highly detailed raised relief hieroglyphs on the White Chapel of Senusret I at Karnak (Middle Kingdom).

Photo: Dr Amy Calvert</span></span>Text accompanied almost all images. In statuary, identifying text will appear on the back pillar or base, and relief usually has captions or longer texts that complete and elaborate on the scenes. Hieroglyphs were often rendered as tiny works of art in themselves, even though these small pictures do not always stand for what they depict; many are instead phonetic sounds. Some, however, are logographic, meaning they stand for an object or concept.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lines blur between text and image in many cases. For instance, the name of a figure in the text on a statue will regularly omit the determinative (an unspoken sign at the end of a word that aids identification&ndash;for example, verbs of motion are followed by a pair of walking legs, names of men end with the image of a man, names of gods with the image of a seated god, etc.) at the end of the name. In these instances, the representation itself serves this function.</p>\n"

Beginning before the turn of the 18th century, but accelerated by the opportunity opened by the death of the Sun King in 1715, nobles set up their own homes after decades of living under the king&rsquo;s enormous roof at Versailles, and created a radically different domestic life. Although it was only seven years until Louis XIV&rsquo;s great-grandson was old enough to take the throne to reign as Louis XV, by 1722 new ideas of privacy, comfort, and intimate home life led to a new design language, the Rococo.

"<h3>A move away from Baroque grandeur and classicism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Louis XIV, during his long reign, had established France as a major European economic and political power, not least by the use of design as a strategic propaganda tool. Where the grandeur, drama, and theatricality of the Baroque, as Louis imported it from Rome, had been the perfect tool for portraying the King and his country as supremely powerful, by the early 18th century, the Baroque was starting to seem exhaustingly sumptuous. Baroque design was based on the classical language, which the earlier Renaissance artists had delighted in rediscovering, augmenting, and modifying. But by the early decades of the 18th century, designers were increasingly turning away from bombastic classicism to other sources, notably the natural world. They began playing with un-classical ideas like asymmetry, movement, linearity, sinuous curves, and realistic natural ornament. The Rococo, as it developed in design, was a sharp turn away from everything the Baroque had become. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

Furthermore, he signed his pieces (BVRB). In keeping with Enlightenment ideas of the 18th century which celebrated individuality and personal achievement, increasingly craftsmen were identifying themselves with their work.

"\n"
"<p>In 1226 a French king died, leaving his queen to rule his kingdom until their son came of age. The 38-year-old widow, Blanche of Castile, had her work cut out for her. Rebelling barons were eager to win back lands that her husband&rsquo;s father had seized from them. They rallied troops against her, defamed her character, and even accused her of adultery and murder.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Caught in a perilous web of treachery, insurrections, and open warfare, Blanche persuaded, cajoled, negotiated, and fought would-be enemies after her husband, King Louis VIII, died of dysentery after only a three-year reign.

"<h3>A manuscript illumination</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A dazzling illumination in New York&rsquo;s Morgan Library could well depict Blanche of Castile and her son Louis, a beardless youth crowned king. A cleric and a scribe are depicted underneath them. Each figure is set against a ground of burnished gold, seated beneath a trefoil arch. Stylized and colorful buildings dance above their heads, suggesting a sophisticated, urban setting&mdash;perhaps Paris, the capital city of the Capetian kingdom (the Capetians were one of the oldest royal families in France) and home to a renowned school of theology.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A moralized Bible&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This last page the New York Morgan Library&rsquo;s manuscript MS M 240 is the last quire (folded page) of a three-volume moralized bible, the majority of which is housed at the Cathedral Treasury in Toledo, Spain. Moralized bibles, made expressedly for the French royal house, include lavishly illustrated abbreviated passages from the Old and New Testaments. Explanatory texts that allude to historical events and tales accompany these literary and visual readings, which&mdash;woven together&mdash;convey a moral.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Assuming historians are correct in identifying the two rulers, we are looking at the four people intensely involved in the production of this manuscript. As patron and ruler, Queen Blanche of Castile would have financed its production. As ruler-to-be, Louis IX&rsquo;s job was to take its lessons to heart along with those from the other biblical and ancient texts that his tutors read with him. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>King and queen&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the upper register, an enthroned king and queen wear the traditional medieval open crown topped with fleur-de-lys&mdash;a stylized iris or lily symbolizing a French monarch&rsquo;s religious, political, and dynastic right to rule. The blue-eyed queen, left, is veiled in a white widow&rsquo;s wimple. An ermine-lined blue mantle drapes over her shoulders. Her pink T-shaped tunic spills over a thin blue edge of paint which visually supports these enthroned figures. A slender green column divides the queen&rsquo;s space from that of her son, King Louis IX, to whom she deliberately gestures across the page, raising her left hand in his direction. Her pose and animated facial expression suggest that she is dedicating this manuscript, with its lessons and morals, to the young king.</p>\n"

"<p>In 1226 a French king died, leaving his queen to rule his kingdom until their son came of age. The 38-year-old widow, Blanche of Castile, had her work cut out for her. Rebelling barons were eager to win back lands that her husband&rsquo;s father had seized from them. They rallied troops against her, defamed her character, and even accused her of adultery and murder.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Caught in a perilous web of treachery, insurrections, and open warfare, Blanche persuaded, cajoled, negotiated, and fought would-be enemies after her husband, King Louis VIII, died of dysentery after only a three-year reign.

"<h3>A manuscript illumination</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A dazzling illumination in New York&rsquo;s Morgan Library could well depict Blanche of Castile and her son Louis, a beardless youth crowned king. A cleric and a scribe are depicted underneath them. Each figure is set against a ground of burnished gold, seated beneath a trefoil arch. Stylized and colorful buildings dance above their heads, suggesting a sophisticated, urban setting&mdash;perhaps Paris, the capital city of the Capetian kingdom (the Capetians were one of the oldest royal families in France) and home to a renowned school of theology.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A moralized Bible&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This last page the New York Morgan Library&rsquo;s manuscript MS M 240 is the last quire (folded page) of a three-volume moralized bible, the majority of which is housed at the Cathedral Treasury in Toledo, Spain. Moralized bibles, made expressedly for the French royal house, include lavishly illustrated abbreviated passages from the Old and New Testaments. Explanatory texts that allude to historical events and tales accompany these literary and visual readings, which&mdash;woven together&mdash;convey a moral.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Assuming historians are correct in identifying the two rulers, we are looking at the four people intensely involved in the production of this manuscript. As patron and ruler, Queen Blanche of Castile would have financed its production. As ruler-to-be, Louis IX&rsquo;s job was to take its lessons to heart along with those from the other biblical and ancient texts that his tutors read with him. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>King and queen&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the upper register, an enthroned king and queen wear the traditional medieval open crown topped with fleur-de-lys&mdash;a stylized iris or lily symbolizing a French monarch&rsquo;s religious, political, and dynastic right to rule. The blue-eyed queen, left, is veiled in a white widow&rsquo;s wimple. An ermine-lined blue mantle drapes over her shoulders. Her pink T-shaped tunic spills over a thin blue edge of paint which visually supports these enthroned figures. A slender green column divides the queen&rsquo;s space from that of her son, King Louis IX, to whom she deliberately gestures across the page, raising her left hand in his direction. Her pose and animated facial expression suggest that she is dedicating this manuscript, with its lessons and morals, to the young king.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Numerous snakes&nbsp;appear to writhe across the sculpture&rsquo;s surface. In fact, snakes form her entire skirt, as well as her belt and even her head.

Her upper torso is exposed, and we can just make out her breasts and rolls in her abdomen. The rolls indicate she is a mother. A sizable necklace formed of hands and hearts largely obscures her breasts.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two enormous snakes curl upwards from her neck to face one another. Their bifurcated, or split, tongues curl downwards, and the resulting effect is that the snake heads and tongues appear to be a single, forward-facing serpent face. Snakes coming out of body parts,&nbsp;as we see here, was an Aztec convention for squirting blood. Coatlicue has in fact been decapitated, and her snaky head represents the blood squirting from her severed neck. Her arms are also formed of snake heads, suggesting she was&nbsp;dismembered there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>You might read elsewhere that Coatlicue was decapitated by her daughter or beheaded when her son was born from her severed neck (the idea has been adopted in part to explain this&nbsp;monumental sculpture). However, the myth from which this story derives does not actually state that Coatlicue suffered this fate. For this reason, it is useful to review the myth&mdash;one of the most important for the Aztecs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Battle atop Snake Mountain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The primary myth in which Coatlicue is involved recounts the birth of the Aztec patron deity, Huitzilopochtli (pronounced &quot;wheat-zil-oh-poach-lee&quot;). This myth was recorded in the later sixteenth century after the Spanish Conquest of 1521.&nbsp;The main source from which we learn about it is the <em>General History of the Things of New Spain</em>, also called <em>The Florentine Codex </em>(written 1575&ndash;77 and compiled by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, indigenous authors and artists, and indigenous informants).[1]</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahagún, General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex), 1575–77, volume 1, page 420\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cc0858043f003a3d842f1cc2cb564a95483151c7.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, <em>General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex)</em>, 1575&ndash;77, volume 1, page 420</span></span>One day Coatlicue, an earth goddess, was sweeping atop Coatepec (or Snake Mountain), when a feather fell into her apron. At that moment, she immaculately conceived a son, whose name was Huitzilopochtli (a sun and warrior god). Upon hearing that her mother was pregnant, Coyolxauhqui (or Bells-Her-Cheeks, pronounced &quot;coy-al-shauw-kee&quot;) became enraged. She rallied her 400 brothers, the <em>Centzonhuitz-nahua,</em>&nbsp;to storm Snake Mountain and kill their mother. One of the brothers decided to warn Coatlicue. Upon hearing of this impending murder, Coatlicue became understandably afraid. But Huitzilopochtli comforted her, telling her not to worry. At the moment Coyolxauhqui approached her mother, Huitzilopochtli was born, fully grown and armed. He sliced off his sister&rsquo;s head, and threw her body off the mountain. As she fell, her body broke apart until it came to rest&nbsp;at the bottom of Snake Mountain. But what became of Coatlicue, the mother to the victorious Huitzilopochtli and the defeated Coyolxauhqui? The myth does not mention her decapitation and dismemberment (only her daughter&rsquo;s), so why would this&nbsp;famous&nbsp;sculpture display her in this manner?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why was Coatlicue decapitated?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More recently, a new interpretation has been offered for Coatlicue&rsquo;s appearance that is based on another myth (recounted in different Spanish Colonial source) concerning the beginning of 5th era, or 5th sun.The Aztecs believed that there were four earlier suns (or eras) prior to the one in which we currently live. The myth notes that several female deities (perhaps Coatlicue among them), sacrificed themselves to put the sun in motion, effectively allowing time itself to continue. They were responsible for preserving the cosmos by offering their own lives.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt,  257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7245a7e2066f010d3debbb789296c8c86049d06d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt, 257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After this point, these female deities were then symbolized by their skirts (called <em>mantas</em>), which could explain the careful attention paid to Coatlicue&rsquo;s snaky skirt. It functions as a reminder of her name&mdash;Snakes-Her-Skirt&mdash;as well as symbolizing&nbsp;her as a deity and&nbsp;reminding the viewer&nbsp;of her past deeds. This might also explain why&mdash;in place of her head&mdash;we have two snakes rising from her severed neck.&nbsp;They represent streaming blood, which was a precious liquid connoting fertility. With her willing sacrifice, Coatlicue enabled life to continue.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some details on the sculpture support this newer and enticing interpretation. There is a date glyph, 12 Reed, inscribed on the sculpture&rsquo;s back which might relate to the beginning of a new solar era. Archaeologists have also found the remains of several other monumental sculptures of female deities similar to Coatlicue, but each display different skirts. One of these sculptures (see photo at top of the page) stands near to Coatlicue in the Anthropology Museum, but hearts adorn her skirt instead of snakes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Coatlicue de Cozcatlán, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8f7c8d37b4ea61b5e1720fae09c36a7f8792f7ca.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coatlicue de Cozcatl&aacute;n, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span>Despite her fame in one of the most important Aztec myths concerning their patron god, Coatlicue did not have numerous stories recorded about her during the sixteenth century (that we know of at least). Few surviving Aztec objects display her. However, another stone sculpture in the National Museum of Anthropology&mdash;on a much smaller scale&mdash;shows Coatlicue with her head intact. We can identify her by her snaky skirt. Her face is partly skeletonized and de-fleshed. Her nose is missing, revealing the cavity. Yet she still has flesh on her lips, which are open to reveal bared teeth. Even with her head, this version of Coatlicue still seems intimidating to us today. But was she perceived as terrifying by the Aztecs or is this only a twenty-first century impression of her?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Terrifying and Respected</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Prior to the Spanish Conquest, Coatlicue related to other female earth deities, such as Toci (Our Grandmother). Several sixteenth-century Spanish Colonial sources&nbsp;mention that Coatlicue belonged to a class of deities known as <em>tzitzimime</em> (deities related to the stars), who were considered terrifying and dangerous. For example, outside of the 360-days that formed the agricultural calendar (called the year count or <em>xiuhpohualli</em>), there were five&nbsp;extra &ldquo;nameless&rdquo; days. The Aztecs believed this&nbsp;was an ominous time when bad things could happen. The <em>tzitzimime</em>, for instance, could descend to the earth&rsquo;s surface and eat people or at least wreak havoc, causing instability and fear. In Spanish Colonial chronicles, the <em>tzitzimime</em> are depicted with skeletonized faces and monster claws&mdash;similar to what we see in Coatlicue sculptures discussed here. These sources also call the <em>tzitzimime</em> demons or devils.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For all their ferociousness, however, the <em>tzitzimime</em>&nbsp;also had&nbsp;positive associations. Ironically,&nbsp;this&nbsp;group of deities were patrons of midwives, or women responsible for helping mothers with their babies. People also invoked them for medical help&nbsp;and they&nbsp;had associations with fertility. For these reasons, they had a more ambivalent role than as simply good or bad deities, and so they were both respected and feared.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Created, Buried, Found, Buried, Found Again</h3>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Numerous snakes&nbsp;appear to writhe across the sculpture&rsquo;s surface. In fact, snakes form her entire skirt, as well as her belt and even her head. Coatlicue&rsquo;s name literally means Snakes-Her-Skirt, so her clothing helps&nbsp;identify her. Her snake belt ties at the waist to&nbsp;keep a skull &ldquo;buckle&rdquo; in place. Her upper torso is exposed, and we can just make out her breasts and rolls in her abdomen. The rolls indicate she is a mother. A sizable necklace formed of hands and hearts largely obscures her breasts.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two enormous snakes curl upwards from her neck to face one another. Their bifurcated, or split, tongues curl downwards, and the resulting effect is that the snake heads and tongues appear to be a single, forward-facing serpent face. Snakes coming out of body parts,&nbsp;as we see here, was an Aztec convention for squirting blood. Coatlicue has in fact been decapitated, and her snaky head represents the blood squirting from her severed neck. Her arms are also formed of snake heads, suggesting she was&nbsp;dismembered there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4363cb475d7f019850c0737c38ddd36704988a60.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Snakes facing one another (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt, 257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You might read elsewhere that Coatlicue was decapitated by her daughter or beheaded when her son was born from her severed neck (the idea has been adopted in part to explain this&nbsp;monumental sculpture). However, the myth from which this story derives does not actually state that Coatlicue suffered this fate. For this reason, it is useful to review the myth&mdash;one of the most important for the Aztecs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Battle atop Snake Mountain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The primary myth in which Coatlicue is involved recounts the birth of the Aztec patron deity, Huitzilopochtli (pronounced &quot;wheat-zil-oh-poach-lee&quot;). This myth was recorded in the later sixteenth century after the Spanish Conquest of 1521.&nbsp;The main source from which we learn about it is the <em>General History of the Things of New Spain</em>, also called <em>The Florentine Codex </em>(written 1575&ndash;77 and compiled by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, indigenous authors and artists, and indigenous informants).[1]</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahagún, General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex), 1575–77, volume 1, page 420\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cc0858043f003a3d842f1cc2cb564a95483151c7.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, <em>General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex)</em>, 1575&ndash;77, volume 1, page 420</span></span>One day Coatlicue, an earth goddess, was sweeping atop Coatepec (or Snake Mountain), when a feather fell into her apron. At that moment, she immaculately conceived a son, whose name was Huitzilopochtli (a sun and warrior god). Upon hearing that her mother was pregnant, Coyolxauhqui (or Bells-Her-Cheeks, pronounced &quot;coy-al-shauw-kee&quot;) became enraged. She rallied her 400 brothers, the <em>Centzonhuitz-nahua,</em>&nbsp;to storm Snake Mountain and kill their mother. One of the brothers decided to warn Coatlicue. Upon hearing of this impending murder, Coatlicue became understandably afraid. But Huitzilopochtli comforted her, telling her not to worry. At the moment Coyolxauhqui approached her mother, Huitzilopochtli was born, fully grown and armed. He sliced off his sister&rsquo;s head, and threw her body off the mountain. As she fell, her body broke apart until it came to rest&nbsp;at the bottom of Snake Mountain. But what became of Coatlicue, the mother to the victorious Huitzilopochtli and the defeated Coyolxauhqui? The myth does not mention her decapitation and dismemberment (only her daughter&rsquo;s), so why would this&nbsp;famous&nbsp;sculpture display her in this manner?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why was Coatlicue decapitated?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More recently, a new interpretation has been offered for Coatlicue&rsquo;s appearance that is based on another myth (recounted in different Spanish Colonial source) concerning the beginning of 5th era, or 5th sun.The Aztecs believed that there were four earlier suns (or eras) prior to the one in which we currently live. The myth notes that several female deities (perhaps Coatlicue among them), sacrificed themselves to put the sun in motion, effectively allowing time itself to continue. They were responsible for preserving the cosmos by offering their own lives.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt,  257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7245a7e2066f010d3debbb789296c8c86049d06d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt, 257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After this point, these female deities were then symbolized by their skirts (called <em>mantas</em>), which could explain the careful attention paid to Coatlicue&rsquo;s snaky skirt. It functions as a reminder of her name&mdash;Snakes-Her-Skirt&mdash;as well as symbolizing&nbsp;her as a deity and&nbsp;reminding the viewer&nbsp;of her past deeds. This might also explain why&mdash;in place of her head&mdash;we have two snakes rising from her severed neck.&nbsp;They represent streaming blood, which was a precious liquid connoting fertility. With her willing sacrifice, Coatlicue enabled life to continue.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some details on the sculpture support this newer and enticing interpretation. There is a date glyph, 12 Reed, inscribed on the sculpture&rsquo;s back which might relate to the beginning of a new solar era. Archaeologists have also found the remains of several other monumental sculptures of female deities similar to Coatlicue, but each display different skirts. One of these sculptures (see photo at top of the page) stands near to Coatlicue in the Anthropology Museum, but hearts adorn her skirt instead of snakes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Coatlicue de Cozcatlán, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8f7c8d37b4ea61b5e1720fae09c36a7f8792f7ca.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coatlicue de Cozcatl&aacute;n, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span>Despite her fame in one of the most important Aztec myths concerning their patron god, Coatlicue did not have numerous stories recorded about her during the sixteenth century (that we know of at least). Few surviving Aztec objects display her. However, another stone sculpture in the National Museum of Anthropology&mdash;on a much smaller scale&mdash;shows Coatlicue with her head intact. We can identify her by her snaky skirt. Her face is partly skeletonized and de-fleshed. Her nose is missing, revealing the cavity. Yet she still has flesh on her lips, which are open to reveal bared teeth. Even with her head, this version of Coatlicue still seems intimidating to us today. But was she perceived as terrifying by the Aztecs or is this only a twenty-first century impression of her?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Terrifying and Respected</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Prior to the Spanish Conquest, Coatlicue related to other female earth deities, such as Toci (Our Grandmother). Several sixteenth-century Spanish Colonial sources&nbsp;mention that Coatlicue belonged to a class of deities known as <em>tzitzimime</em> (deities related to the stars), who were considered terrifying and dangerous. For example, outside of the 360-days that formed the agricultural calendar (called the year count or <em>xiuhpohualli</em>), there were five&nbsp;extra &ldquo;nameless&rdquo; days. The Aztecs believed this&nbsp;was an ominous time when bad things could happen. The <em>tzitzimime</em>, for instance, could descend to the earth&rsquo;s surface and eat people or at least wreak havoc, causing instability and fear. In Spanish Colonial chronicles, the <em>tzitzimime</em> are depicted with skeletonized faces and monster claws&mdash;similar to what we see in Coatlicue sculptures discussed here. These sources also call the <em>tzitzimime</em> demons or devils.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For all their ferociousness, however, the <em>tzitzimime</em>&nbsp;also had&nbsp;positive associations. Ironically,&nbsp;this&nbsp;group of deities were patrons of midwives, or women responsible for helping mothers with their babies. People also invoked them for medical help&nbsp;and they&nbsp;had associations with fertility. For these reasons, they had a more ambivalent role than as simply good or bad deities, and so they were both respected and feared.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Created, Buried, Found, Buried, Found Again</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After the Spanish Conquest, the monumental Coatlicue sculpture was buried because it was considered an inappropriate pagan idol by Spanish Christian invaders. After languishing in obscurity for more than 200 years, it was rediscovered in 1790.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Parchment&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For much of the Middle Ages dead cows were the main ingredient for books. What was frolicking in the meadow one month, may have been a page in a Bible the next. The skin of animals (calves, goats, sheep)&nbsp;was turned into parchment, which was subsequently cut into sheets. Parchment was introduced in late antiquity, when the codex (a&nbsp;book made of double leaves), was born and started to replace the papyrus scroll.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is a lot you can tell from medieval skin. Like a physician today, the book historian can make a diagnosis by observing it carefully. The quality of parchment&nbsp;sheets varied considerably. Like people today, not all medieval creatures had perfect skin. Some cows loved to rub against trees while&nbsp;others were particularly prone to insect bites. We can still see these defects today, which appear as tiny holes, gaps or dark patches&nbsp;as we read Saint Jerome or Chaucer.</p>\n"

A scribe producing a book for his own library may be less attentive than one that worked in a monastic community. The best sheets have a deep-white color, with a hint of yellow. They feel like velvet and make a slight rustling sound when you turn the page&mdash;suspenseful whispers that teased the reader (image above). Bad skin, by contrast, crackles. It is of uneven thickness, and shows staining and a variety of colors (image below). Unlike what you may have thought, looking at imperfect skin is far more interesting than studying its perfect counterpart. This is because a defect tells a powerful story, shedding light on the book&rsquo;s production and providing clues about its use and storage post-production.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Medieval craftsmen were well aware of the varying quality of animal skins, which they used as the basis for their books. However, calves, sheep or goats that had given up their livelihood and skin for the sake of medieval readers were not always to blame&mdash;and neither were the scribes.&nbsp;The most common imperfections are holes produced by the knife of the parchment maker.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Preparing parchment was a delicate business. In order to clear the skin of flesh and hair, it was attached to a wooden frame, tight like a drum. If the round knife of the parchment maker (the lunellum) cut too deep during this scraping process, elongated rips or holes would appear. &nbsp;A small puncture easily became a gaping hole. The art of preparing animal skin was to apply just the right amount of pressure.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, readers did not seem to mind the holes too much and scribes usually just wrote around them, or they repaired them. Sometimes&nbsp;the reader is given an unexpected sneak peek onto the next page&mdash;where a dragon may just be introduced into the story (as in the image above).&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Repairing holes was sometimes done more eloquently. In the manuscript above,&nbsp;the hole&nbsp;is&nbsp;not made to disappear, but it is highlighted by colored threads.

"\n"
"<p>Another skin problem encountered by scribes during a book&rsquo;s production was the animal&rsquo;s hair follicle&mdash;the skin organ that produces hair (seen above). These follicles show as pronounced black dots on the white page. Often parchment makers or scribes were able to sand them away, producing the desired smooth and cream-colored surface. However, if the follicles had been too deep in a calf or sheep, no dermatologist could have removed the imperfection, let alone the blunt instruments of the scribe. The only thing to do was to write around the patch. The follicles are helpful because they allow us to determine&mdash; from the distance between them&mdash;whether the animal was a calf, a sheep or a goat. This, in turn, may shed light on where the manuscript was produced: the use of goat, for example, often points to Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The transition to paper</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 12th century another material appeared in Europe: paper. Imported from Arabic culture, it was first exclusively used for documentary purposes, such as account books and letters. In a remarkable shift of scribal practices, in the fourteenth century scribes all over Europe started to use paper for manuscripts. Conservative scribes, such as monks, ignored the new material for some time, while others&mdash;especially those who wanted to economize&mdash;embraced it. Paper and parchment were used for all sorts of manuscripts, from chunky volumes to small portable&nbsp;books.</p>\n"

"<h3>Parchment&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For much of the Middle Ages dead cows were the main ingredient for books. What was frolicking in the meadow one month, may have been a page in a Bible the next. The skin of animals (calves, goats, sheep)&nbsp;was turned into parchment, which was subsequently cut into sheets. Parchment was introduced in late antiquity, when the codex (a&nbsp;book made of double leaves), was born and started to replace the papyrus scroll.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is a lot you can tell from medieval skin. Like a physician today, the book historian can make a diagnosis by observing it carefully. The quality of parchment&nbsp;sheets varied considerably. Like people today, not all medieval creatures had perfect skin. Some cows loved to rub against trees while&nbsp;others were particularly prone to insect bites. We can still see these defects today, which appear as tiny holes, gaps or dark patches&nbsp;as we read Saint Jerome or Chaucer.</p>\n"

Paris Bible, The Hague, Royal Library, MS 132 F 21,&nbsp;mid 13th century&nbsp;</span></span>The quality of the page also had a lot to do with preparation. A scribe producing a book for his own library may be less attentive than one that worked in a monastic community. The best sheets have a deep-white color, with a hint of yellow. They feel like velvet and make a slight rustling sound when you turn the page&mdash;suspenseful whispers that teased the reader (image above). Bad skin, by contrast, crackles. It is of uneven thickness, and shows staining and a variety of colors (image below). Unlike what you may have thought, looking at imperfect skin is far more interesting than studying its perfect counterpart. This is because a defect tells a powerful story, shedding light on the book&rsquo;s production and providing clues about its use and storage post-production.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Medieval craftsmen were well aware of the varying quality of animal skins, which they used as the basis for their books. However, calves, sheep or goats that had given up their livelihood and skin for the sake of medieval readers were not always to blame&mdash;and neither were the scribes.&nbsp;The most common imperfections are holes produced by the knife of the parchment maker.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Preparing parchment was a delicate business. In order to clear the skin of flesh and hair, it was attached to a wooden frame, tight like a drum. If the round knife of the parchment maker (the lunellum) cut too deep during this scraping process, elongated rips or holes would appear. &nbsp;A small puncture easily became a gaping hole. The art of preparing animal skin was to apply just the right amount of pressure.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, readers did not seem to mind the holes too much and scribes usually just wrote around them, or they repaired them. Sometimes&nbsp;the reader is given an unexpected sneak peek onto the next page&mdash;where a dragon may just be introduced into the story (as in the image above).&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Another skin problem encountered by scribes during a book&rsquo;s production was the animal&rsquo;s hair follicle&mdash;the skin organ that produces hair (seen above). These follicles show as pronounced black dots on the white page. Often parchment makers or scribes were able to sand them away, producing the desired smooth and cream-colored surface. However, if the follicles had been too deep in a calf or sheep, no dermatologist could have removed the imperfection, let alone the blunt instruments of the scribe. The only thing to do was to write around the patch. The follicles are helpful because they allow us to determine&mdash; from the distance between them&mdash;whether the animal was a calf, a sheep or a goat. This, in turn, may shed light on where the manuscript was produced: the use of goat, for example, often points to Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The transition to paper</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 12th century another material appeared in Europe: paper. Imported from Arabic culture, it was first exclusively used for documentary purposes, such as account books and letters. In a remarkable shift of scribal practices, in the fourteenth century scribes all over Europe started to use paper for manuscripts. Conservative scribes, such as monks, ignored the new material for some time, while others&mdash;especially those who wanted to economize&mdash;embraced it. Paper and parchment were used for all sorts of manuscripts, from chunky volumes to small portable&nbsp;books.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>A new city</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Seventh-century North Africa was not the easiest place to establish a new city. It required battling Byzantines; convincing Berbers, the indigenous people of North Africa, to accept centralized Muslim rule; and persuading Middle Eastern merchants to move to North Africa. So, in 670 CE, conquering general Sidi Okba constructed a Friday Mosque (<em>masjid-i jami`</em>&nbsp;or<em>&nbsp;jami`</em>) in what was becoming Kairouan in modern day Tunisia. A Friday Mosque is used for communal prayers on the Muslim holy day, Friday. The mosque was a critical addition, communicating that Kairouan would become a cosmopolitan metropolis under strong Muslim control, an important distinction at this time and place.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan, it is an early example of a hypostyle mosque that also reflects how pre-Islamic and eastern Islamic art and motifs were incorporated into the religious architecture of Islamic North Africa. The aesthetics signified the Great Mosque and Kairouan, and, thus, its patrons, were just as important as the religious structures, cities, and rulers of other empires in this region, and that Kairouan was part of the burgeoning Islamic empire.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Aghlabids</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the eighth century, Sidi Okba&rsquo;s mosque was rebuilt at least twice as Kairouan prospered. However, the mosque we see today is essentially ninth century. The Aghlabids (800-909 C.E.) were the semi-independent rulers of much of North Africa. In 836, Prince Ziyadat Allah I tore down most of the earlier mudbrick structure and rebuilt it in more permanent stone, brick, and wood. The prayer hall or sanctuary is supported by rows of columns and there is an open courtyard, that are characteristic of a hypostyle plan.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Great Mosque of Kairouan prayer hall facade (photo: Damian Entwistle, CC BY-SA 2.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1dd5094c4cfec6ef3f5a0f9786bd45098672d9b1.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Great Mosque of Kairouan prayer hall facade (photo: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Great_Mosque_of_Kairouan_prayer_hall_facade.jpg\">Damian Entwistle</a>, CC BY-SA 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the late ninth century, another Aghlabid ruler embellished the courtyard entrance to the prayer space and added a dome over the central arches and portal. The dome emphasizes the placement of the mihrab, or prayer niche (below), which is on the same central axis and also under a cupola to signify its importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The drum rests on squinches, small arches decorated with shell over rosette designs similar to examples in Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad Islamic art. The stone dome is constructed of twenty four ribs that each have a small corbel at their base, so the dome looks like a cut cantaloupe, according to the architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell.</p>\n"

Like other hypostyle mosques, such as the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque in Medina, the mosque of Kairouan is roughly rectangular. Wider aisles leading to the mihrab and along the qibla wall give it a T-plan.

"<p>Since it was used for Friday prayer, the mosque has a ninth-century minbar, a narrow wooden pulpit where the weekly sermon was delivered. It is said to be the oldest surviving wooden minbar. Like Christian pulpits, the minbar made the prayer leader more visible and audible. Because a ruler&rsquo;s legitimacy could rest upon the mention of his name during the sermon, the minbar served both religious and secular purposes. The minbar is made from teak imported from Asia, an expensive material exemplifying Kairouan&rsquo;s commercial reach. The side of the minbar closest to the mihrab is composed of elaborately carved latticework with vegetal, floral, and geometric designs evocative of those used in Byzantine and Umayyad architecture.</p>\n"

Perhaps inspired by Roman lighthouses, the massive square Kairouan minaret is about thirty two meters tall, over one hundred feet, making it one of the highest structures around. So in addition to functioning as a place to call for prayer, the minaret identifies the mosque&rsquo;s presence and location in the city while helping to define the city&rsquo;s religious identity. As it was placed just off the mihrab axis, it also affirmed the mihrab&rsquo;s importance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mosque continued to be modified after the Aghlabids, showing that it remained religiously and socially significant even as Kairouan fell into decline. A Zirid, al-Mu&lsquo;izz ibn Badis (ruled 1016-62 CE), commissioned a wooden maqsura, an enclosed space within a mosque that was reserved for the ruler and his associates. The maqsura is assembled from cutwork wooden screens topped with bands of carved abstracted vegetal motifs set into geometric frames, kufic-style script inscriptions, and merlons, which look like the crenellations a top a fortress wall. Maqsuras are said to indicate political instability in a society. They remove a ruler from the rest of the worshippers. So, the enclosure, along with its inscription, protected the lives and affirmed the status of persons allowed inside.</p>\n"

In 1294, Caliph al-Mustansir restored the courtyard and added monumental portals, such as Bab al-Ma on the east and the domed Bab Lalla Rejana on the west. Additional gates were constructed in later centuries. Carved stone panels inside the mosque and on the exterior acted like billboards advertising which patron was responsible for construction and restoration.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<h3>An intellectual center</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Great Mosque was literally and figuratively at the center of Kairouan activity, growth, and prestige. Though the mosque is now near the northwest city ramparts established in the eleventh century, when Sidi Okba founded Kairouan, it was probably closer to the center of town, near what was the governor&rsquo;s residence and the main thoroughfare, a symbolically prominent and physical visible part of the city. By the mid-tenth century, Kairouan became a thriving settlement with marketplaces, agriculture imported from surrounding towns, cisterns supplying water, and textile and ceramic manufacturing areas. It was a political capital, a pilgrimage city, and intellectual center, particularly for the Maliki school of Sunni Islam and the sciences. The Great Mosque had fifteen thoroughfares leading from it into a city that may have had a circular layout like Baghdad, the capital of the Islamic empire during Kairouan&rsquo;s heyday. As a Friday Mosque, it was one of if not the largest buildings in town.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3><span>A new city</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Seventh-century North Africa was not the easiest place to establish a new city. It required battling Byzantines; convincing Berbers, the indigenous people of North Africa, to accept centralized Muslim rule; and persuading Middle Eastern merchants to move to North Africa. So, in 670 CE, conquering general Sidi Okba constructed a Friday Mosque (<em>masjid-i jami`</em>&nbsp;or<em>&nbsp;jami`</em>) in what was becoming Kairouan in modern day Tunisia. A Friday Mosque is used for communal prayers on the Muslim holy day, Friday. The mosque was a critical addition, communicating that Kairouan would become a cosmopolitan metropolis under strong Muslim control, an important distinction at this time and place.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan, it is an early example of a hypostyle mosque that also reflects how pre-Islamic and eastern Islamic art and motifs were incorporated into the religious architecture of Islamic North Africa. The aesthetics signified the Great Mosque and Kairouan, and, thus, its patrons, were just as important as the religious structures, cities, and rulers of other empires in this region, and that Kairouan was part of the burgeoning Islamic empire.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Aghlabids</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the eighth century, Sidi Okba&rsquo;s mosque was rebuilt at least twice as Kairouan prospered. However, the mosque we see today is essentially ninth century. The Aghlabids (800-909 C.E.) were the semi-independent rulers of much of North Africa. In 836, Prince Ziyadat Allah I tore down most of the earlier mudbrick structure and rebuilt it in more permanent stone, brick, and wood. The prayer hall or sanctuary is supported by rows of columns and there is an open courtyard, that are characteristic of a hypostyle plan.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>In the late ninth century, another Aghlabid ruler embellished the courtyard entrance to the prayer space and added a dome over the central arches and portal. The dome emphasizes the placement of the mihrab, or prayer niche (below), which is on the same central axis and also under a cupola to signify its importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The drum rests on squinches, small arches decorated with shell over rosette designs similar to examples in Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad Islamic art. The stone dome is constructed of twenty four ribs that each have a small corbel at their base, so the dome looks like a cut cantaloupe, according to the architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell.</p>\n"

"<p><span>Other architectural elements link the Great Mosque of Kairouan with earlier and contemporary Islamic religious structures and pre-Islamic buildings. They also show the joint religious and secular importance of the Great Mosque of Kairouan. Like other hypostyle mosques, such as the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque in Medina, the mosque of Kairouan is roughly rectangular. Wider aisles leading to the mihrab and along the qibla wall give it a T-plan. The sanctuary roof and courtyard porticos are supported by repurposed Roman and Byzantine columns and capitals.</span></p>\n"

"<p>Since it was used for Friday prayer, the mosque has a ninth-century minbar, a narrow wooden pulpit where the weekly sermon was delivered. It is said to be the oldest surviving wooden minbar. Like Christian pulpits, the minbar made the prayer leader more visible and audible. Because a ruler&rsquo;s legitimacy could rest upon the mention of his name during the sermon, the minbar served both religious and secular purposes. The minbar is made from teak imported from Asia, an expensive material exemplifying Kairouan&rsquo;s commercial reach. The side of the minbar closest to the mihrab is composed of elaborately carved latticework with vegetal, floral, and geometric designs evocative of those used in Byzantine and Umayyad architecture.</p>\n"

Perhaps inspired by Roman lighthouses, the massive square Kairouan minaret is about thirty two meters tall, over one hundred feet, making it one of the highest structures around. So in addition to functioning as a place to call for prayer, the minaret identifies the mosque&rsquo;s presence and location in the city while helping to define the city&rsquo;s religious identity. As it was placed just off the mihrab axis, it also affirmed the mihrab&rsquo;s importance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mosque continued to be modified after the Aghlabids, showing that it remained religiously and socially significant even as Kairouan fell into decline. A Zirid, al-Mu&lsquo;izz ibn Badis (ruled 1016-62 CE), commissioned a wooden maqsura, an enclosed space within a mosque that was reserved for the ruler and his associates. The maqsura is assembled from cutwork wooden screens topped with bands of carved abstracted vegetal motifs set into geometric frames, kufic-style script inscriptions, and merlons, which look like the crenellations a top a fortress wall. Maqsuras are said to indicate political instability in a society. They remove a ruler from the rest of the worshippers. So, the enclosure, along with its inscription, protected the lives and affirmed the status of persons allowed inside.</p>\n"

In 1294, Caliph al-Mustansir restored the courtyard and added monumental portals, such as Bab al-Ma on the east and the domed Bab Lalla Rejana on the west. Additional gates were constructed in later centuries. Carved stone panels inside the mosque and on the exterior acted like billboards advertising which patron was responsible for construction and restoration.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An intellectual center</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Great Mosque was literally and figuratively at the center of Kairouan activity, growth, and prestige. Though the mosque is now near the northwest city ramparts established in the eleventh century, when Sidi Okba founded Kairouan, it was probably closer to the center of town, near what was the governor&rsquo;s residence and the main thoroughfare, a symbolically prominent and physical visible part of the city. By the mid-tenth century, Kairouan became a thriving settlement with marketplaces, agriculture imported from surrounding towns, cisterns supplying water, and textile and ceramic manufacturing areas. It was a political capital, a pilgrimage city, and intellectual center, particularly for the Maliki school of Sunni Islam and the sciences. The Great Mosque had fifteen thoroughfares leading from it into a city that may have had a circular layout like Baghdad, the capital of the Islamic empire during Kairouan&rsquo;s heyday. As a Friday Mosque, it was one of if not the largest buildings in town.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Even today, the Great Mosque of Kairouan reflects the time and place in which it was built.</p>\n"

"<p>We are used to having multiple books open at the same time when looking things up at home or writing an essay for class. Whether PDFs, e-books or good-old-fashioned paper volumes, switching between books in a smooth movement is something we don&rsquo;t often think about. This was very different in medieval times. In those days, books tended to resist when you tried to move them: they were as heavy as a brick and easily twice that size. A related problem was one of space. The average medieval book has a wingspan of at least half a meter wide when open. Consequently, comfortably placing two books in front of you was a stretch, let alone multiple volumes. In an early-sixteenth-century depiction of Erasmus, the scholar cannot even place a single book on his desk as he is writing a letter (above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Interestingly, the challenges of medieval book consultation stands in stark contrast with what we know about reading and studying in the period. We know that readers were&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in learning different points of view with respect to their topic of inquiry, and so&nbsp;browsed through a great number of volumes at the same time. Sparked by this contradiction, this article explores medieval desktops. How many books are being consulted at the same time in medieval depictions of reading? How are the objects laid out across the available space? In short, how are we to understand the logistics behind the devouring of knowledge in the last four centuries of the Middle Ages? As will become clear, the answers to these questions vary greatly depending on why an individual handled multiple books at the same time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Scribes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first group of individuals who had to manage multiple books were scribes. By definition, a scribe had to have at least two books on his desk: the one he was making (a growing pile of quires, which remained unbound until the very end) and the one he was copying from (called the &ldquo;exemplar&rdquo;). While keeping track of the loose quires may have been challenging, of the groups discussed here scribes had it the easiest. After all, the individual was only technically reading one book&mdash;the one he was copying from. This explains why their deskspace was of limited size, at least judging from surviving depictions.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In most cases their working space was erect rather than flat. The&nbsp;famous image of Jean Mi&eacute;lot at work (above) shows how the desktop of the scribe had a 45-degree angle, resulting in an almost erect surface. Clearly visible is also a vertical orientation in the line-up of the books: one was placed above the other. In fact, the desktop in this image is split in half, with the lower half containing the book under production, as well as the scribe&rsquo;s tools (ink pots and pens), while the upper half holds the exemplar. Mi&eacute;lot obviously needed to go shopping for a larger desk, because we see books laying around on the ground and on a bench.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Miniature of the translator, Simon de Hesdin, at work in his study, Valerius Maximus, translated by Simon de Hesdin and Nicholas de Gonesse, Facta et dicta memorabilia, 1479, London, British Library, Royal 18 E III, f. 24 \n"

Although the books are out of sight, the desk clearly provides room for two books. However, they placed next to one another. This may be specially done for the task of a translator, who needed to carefully read the source text and subsequently scribbling down the translation in loose quires or on loose sheets. This way, both books would be right before him: there was no need to look up at a high book platform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Readers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is easy to find images of scribes with a desk full of books, it is less common to encounter readers in similar situations. That is to say: there are very few medieval scenes in which someone is reading but not writing&mdash;where books are present but pens are not. In part, this has to do with medieval study practices. Readers would usually have a pen nearby even when they were just reading. After all, remarks and critiques needed to be added to the margin at the spur of the moment. &ldquo;Penless&rdquo; images, while rare, often show a crowded desktop. The image&nbsp;below&nbsp;shows Christine de Pisan (a late medieval author) browsing multiple books at a big desk.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Brussels, Bibliothèque, Royale, MS 9009-11\n"

"\n"
"<p>The absence of the pen may result from an urge to depict Christine as an avid reader. This is emphasized, I think, by the various volumes that lay open&mdash;note how some open books are facing down, the way we still do today!

"<p>We are used to having multiple books open at the same time when looking things up at home or writing an essay for class. Whether PDFs, e-books or good-old-fashioned paper volumes, switching between books in a smooth movement is something we don&rsquo;t often think about. This was very different in medieval times. In those days, books tended to resist when you tried to move them: they were as heavy as a brick and easily twice that size. A related problem was one of space. The average medieval book has a wingspan of at least half a meter wide when open. Consequently, comfortably placing two books in front of you was a stretch, let alone multiple volumes. In an early-sixteenth-century depiction of Erasmus, the scholar cannot even place a single book on his desk as he is writing a letter (above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Interestingly, the challenges of medieval book consultation stands in stark contrast with what we know about reading and studying in the period. We know that readers were&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in learning different points of view with respect to their topic of inquiry, and so&nbsp;browsed through a great number of volumes at the same time. Sparked by this contradiction, this article explores medieval desktops. How many books are being consulted at the same time in medieval depictions of reading? How are the objects laid out across the available space? In short, how are we to understand the logistics behind the devouring of knowledge in the last four centuries of the Middle Ages? As will become clear, the answers to these questions vary greatly depending on why an individual handled multiple books at the same time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Scribes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first group of individuals who had to manage multiple books were scribes. By definition, a scribe had to have at least two books on his desk: the one he was making (a growing pile of quires, which remained unbound until the very end) and the one he was copying from (called the &ldquo;exemplar&rdquo;). While keeping track of the loose quires may have been challenging, of the groups discussed here scribes had it the easiest. After all, the individual was only technically reading one book&mdash;the one he was copying from. This explains why their deskspace was of limited size, at least judging from surviving depictions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Buonaccorso of Pistoia, of true nobility Debate, Jean Le Tavernier, illuminator, Jean Miélot in his study, after 1450, Brussels, KBR, ms. 9278-80 f. 10\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b899b9fbb99460fd47bbe8e20e0d342194a2aba5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Jean Le Tavernier (illuminator), Jean Mi&eacute;lot in his study, after 1450, Buonaccorso of Pistoia,&nbsp;Brussels, Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, MS 9278-80, fol. 10r</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In most cases their working space was erect rather than flat. The&nbsp;famous image of Jean Mi&eacute;lot at work (above) shows how the desktop of the scribe had a 45-degree angle, resulting in an almost erect surface. Clearly visible is also a vertical orientation in the line-up of the books: one was placed above the other. In fact, the desktop in this image is split in half, with the lower half containing the book under production, as well as the scribe&rsquo;s tools (ink pots and pens), while the upper half holds the exemplar. Mi&eacute;lot obviously needed to go shopping for a larger desk, because we see books laying around on the ground and on a bench.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\" \n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f18742a8b64a8858c5284674ac96de80e1aa5b22.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Miniature of the translator, Simon de Hesdin, at work in his study, Valerius Maximus, translated by Simon de Hesdin and Nicholas de Gonesse, <em>Facta et dicta memorabilia</em>, 1479, London, British Library, Royal MS 18 E. III, fol. 24r</span></span>Interestingly, there are also desks with a horizontal orientation. The image at the left shows the translator Simon de Hesdin at work. Although the books are out of sight, the desk clearly provides room for two books. However, they placed next to one another. This may be specially done for the task of a translator, who needed to carefully read the source text and subsequently scribbling down the translation in loose quires or on loose sheets. This way, both books would be right before him: there was no need to look up at a high book platform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Readers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is easy to find images of scribes with a desk full of books, it is less common to encounter readers in similar situations. That is to say: there are very few medieval scenes in which someone is reading but not writing&mdash;where books are present but pens are not. In part, this has to do with medieval study practices. Readers would usually have a pen nearby even when they were just reading. After all, remarks and critiques needed to be added to the margin at the spur of the moment. &ldquo;Penless&rdquo; images, while rare, often show a crowded desktop. The image&nbsp;below&nbsp;shows Christine de Pisan (a late medieval author) browsing multiple books at a big desk.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Brussels, Bibliothèque, Royale, MS 9009-11\n"

"\n"
"<p>The absence of the pen may result from an urge to depict Christine as an avid reader. This is emphasized, I think, by the various volumes that lay open&mdash;note how some open books are facing down, the way we still do today! From the late medieval period a special tool was available for readers who did not like the clutter shown on Christine&rsquo;s desk: the book carousel.</p>\n"

"<h3>Carpet weaving in the Islamic world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are woven works of art that were produced at every level of society in the Islamic world. Women have been weaving for centuries in villages and nomadic encampments all over the Middle East, Anatolia, and Central Asia, each woman passing down her techniques and designs to her daughters. These women created carpets both for sale and for their own personal use, and this tradition continues today.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Carpets were also made in the royal courts of the Islamic world. These carpets were not just functional floor coverings, they were ornate works of art that indicated the status and wealth of their owners. Court carpets were used on the floors in reception halls, audience chambers, and at court-supported religious institutions. They were also presented as impressive gifts to other rulers. Manuscript paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries suggest smaller rugs were often layered on top of larger carpets and also show that many carpets were used in outdoor pleasure pavilions and palatial parks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rulers had access to expensive materials, such as silk and metal-wrapped threads, and employed the most highly skilled designers and weavers in their empires to create enormous and luxurious carpets. Because of their quality, design, and skilled execution, court carpets are among the finest examples of art from the Islamic world. Court carpets are often very different from the carpets made in commercial workshops or villages. Rather than solely utilizing centuries-old traditional motifs, court carpets often share designs found on a range of media, such as bookbinding and manuscript painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although carpets were made in many royal courts, the Ottoman (1281&ndash;1924), the Safavid (1501&ndash;1732), and the Mughal (1526&ndash;1858) Empires provide some of the richest examples of royally produced carpets.</p>\n"

"<p>The Ottoman Empire originated in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), and was one of the largest and longest lived in the Islamic world. It controlling territories that reached from North Africa to Eastern Europe from 1299 until 1923. Anatolia has a long tradition of carpet weaving, but from the 16th century onward Ottoman court carpets utilized a set of specific designs created by the artists of the Ottoman court workshops, designs that were also used on the court ceramics, paintings, bookbindings, and textiles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the most popular of these was the &ldquo;saz&nbsp;style,&rdquo; which is characterized by long sinuous leaves, and stylized flowers (see below). Court artists also developed the &ldquo;floral style,&rdquo; where we see more naturalistic depictions of flowers such as tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths, among others. The floral and&nbsp;saz&nbsp;styles were sometimes used alone and sometimes used together, along with other motifs like the cintamani pattern (usually a combination of pearl-like circles accompanied by wavy lines sometimes called &quot;tiger stripes&quot;), on a huge variety of objects designed by the court, including ceramics, silks, carpets, and manuscripts.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Both the&nbsp;saz&nbsp;and floral styles appear on this rare Ottoman court prayer rug. The jagged-edged&nbsp;saz&nbsp;leaves gracefully undulate in the border amongst carnations, tulips, and other flowers. The arch at the center of the carpet identifies this as a prayer rug, and symbolizes both amihrab&nbsp;(from mosque architecture) and a gateway to paradise. Such rugs were, and are, used by Muslims during the five daily prayers prescribed in Islam. Though one can go to mosque during the prayer times, prayer can take place anywhere so long as there is a clean surface (provided by the rug) and water for ritual cleansing. A luxurious prayer rug like this would have belonged to a very wealthy court patron.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of this remarkable carpet, the prototype for later designs, may be based on the slender-columned architecture of Muslim Spain. When Muslims and Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, many exiles settled in the Ottoman Empire, bringing with them their own visual culture, which, in turn, influenced Ottoman art. This dual-columned design spawned an entire genre of architecturally-inspired prayer rugs across Anatolia.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Ottoman court carpets is their unusual structure. Unlike all other Turkish carpets, Ottoman court carpets use S-spun wool, which is typical only of carpets woven in Egypt. Scholars attribute this unusual feature to the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, after which the Ottoman court commissioned carpets from Egyptian workshops and had Egyptian weavers and Egyptian wool sent to Turkey for their own use.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Contemporaneous manuscript illustrations shed light on how carpets were used at the court. Though we must remember that paintings are not photographs, and that artists may have invented much in their scenes, paintings like this can nevertheless tell us about the status of carpets in the court. In this painting, ordered by Sultan Murad III, a Safavid dignitary is presented to the Ottoman sultan against the backdrop of a magnificent red and blue Ushak medallion carpet. The painting shows how carpets were used as decorative and symbolic backdrops to Ottoman court rituals.

"<p><span>Carpets intended for religious settings, like the Ardabil carpet, display non-figural decoration such as scrolling vines, flower motifs, calligraphy, and&nbsp;shamsas(sunbursts). Carpets made for secular settings, like the court&rsquo;s palaces and pleasure pavilions, display a wider range of motifs, encompassing the designs found on carpets like the Ardabil, but also sometimes including animals, hunting scenes, human figures, and even angels.</span></p>\n"

"<p>The carpet left is a remarkable example of a secular Safavid court carpet. It was woven entirely of silk, and its bright field is filled with animals&mdash;some real, like lions and rams, and others entirely fantastical. The animals, some of which are engaged in intense combat, are set amoungst a lush backdrop of stylized flowers and trees. The popularity of animal and hunting scenes was well established in Iran; hunting was considered a princely pastime in Iran even before the advent of Islam, and continued as a widely used subject in Safavid art.</p>\n"

"<h3>Carpet weaving in the Islamic world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are woven works of art that were produced at every level of society in the Islamic world. Women have been weaving for centuries in villages and nomadic encampments all over the Middle East, Anatolia, and Central Asia, each woman passing down her techniques and designs to her daughters. These women created carpets both for sale and for their own personal use, and this tradition continues today.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Carpets were also made in the royal courts of the Islamic world. These carpets were not just functional floor coverings, they were ornate works of art that indicated the status and wealth of their owners. Court carpets were used on the floors in reception halls, audience chambers, and at court-supported religious institutions. They were also presented as impressive gifts to other rulers. Manuscript paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries suggest smaller rugs were often layered on top of larger carpets and also show that many carpets were used in outdoor pleasure pavilions and palatial parks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rulers had access to expensive materials, such as silk and metal-wrapped threads, and employed the most highly skilled designers and weavers in their empires to create enormous and luxurious carpets. Because of their quality, design, and skilled execution, court carpets are among the finest examples of art from the Islamic world. Court carpets are often very different from the carpets made in commercial workshops or villages. Rather than solely utilizing centuries-old traditional motifs, court carpets often share designs found on a range of media, such as bookbinding and manuscript painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although carpets were made in many royal courts, the Ottoman (1281&ndash;1924), the Safavid (1501&ndash;1732), and the Mughal (1526&ndash;1858) Empires provide some of the richest examples of royally produced carpets.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Ottoman Empire originated in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), and was one of the largest and longest lived in the Islamic world. It controlling territories that reached from North Africa to Eastern Europe from 1299 until 1923. Anatolia has a long tradition of carpet weaving, but from the 16th century onward Ottoman court carpets utilized a set of specific designs created by the artists of the Ottoman court workshops, designs that were also used on the court ceramics, paintings, bookbindings, and textiles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the most popular of these was the &ldquo;saz&nbsp;style,&rdquo; which is characterized by long sinuous leaves, and stylized flowers (see below). Court artists also developed the &ldquo;floral style,&rdquo; where we see more naturalistic depictions of flowers such as tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths, among others. The floral and&nbsp;saz&nbsp;styles were sometimes used alone and sometimes used together, along with other motifs like the cintamani pattern (usually a combination of pearl-like circles accompanied by wavy lines sometimes called &quot;tiger stripes&quot;), on a huge variety of objects designed by the court, including ceramics, silks, carpets, and manuscripts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Border detail (note the long curving saz style leaves, a pair of white tulips facing downward, and branches of small white hyacinth blossoms\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2f47a838e61775cd192add9d9e670968fd9b3295.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Border detail (note the long curving saz style leaves, a pair of white tulips facing downward, and branches of small white hyacinth blossoms</span></span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Both the&nbsp;saz&nbsp;and floral styles appear on this rare Ottoman court prayer rug. The jagged-edged&nbsp;saz&nbsp;leaves gracefully undulate in the border amongst carnations, tulips, and other flowers. The arch at the center of the carpet identifies this as a prayer rug, and symbolizes both amihrab&nbsp;(from mosque architecture) and a gateway to paradise. Such rugs were, and are, used by Muslims during the five daily prayers prescribed in Islam. Though one can go to mosque during the prayer times, prayer can take place anywhere so long as there is a clean surface (provided by the rug) and water for ritual cleansing. A luxurious prayer rug like this would have belonged to a very wealthy court patron.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of this remarkable carpet, the prototype for later designs, may be based on the slender-columned architecture of Muslim Spain. When Muslims and Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, many exiles settled in the Ottoman Empire, bringing with them their own visual culture, which, in turn, influenced Ottoman art. This dual-columned design spawned an entire genre of architecturally-inspired prayer rugs across Anatolia.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Ottoman court carpets is their unusual structure. Unlike all other Turkish carpets, Ottoman court carpets use S-spun wool, which is typical only of carpets woven in Egypt. Scholars attribute this unusual feature to the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, after which the Ottoman court commissioned carpets from Egyptian workshops and had Egyptian weavers and Egyptian wool sent to Turkey for their own use.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Contemporaneous manuscript illustrations shed light on how carpets were used at the court. Though we must remember that paintings are not photographs, and that artists may have invented much in their scenes, paintings like this can nevertheless tell us about the status of carpets in the court. In this painting, ordered by Sultan Murad III, a Safavid dignitary is presented to the Ottoman sultan against the backdrop of a magnificent red and blue Ushak medallion carpet. The painting shows how carpets were used as decorative and symbolic backdrops to Ottoman court rituals. Not only does the carpet provide a sumptuous setting for the ceremony, it also sends a message to the Safavids (political rivals of the Ottomans) about the wealth of the Ottoman court. We can imagine how such a carpet was used to demonstrate to visitors the power, culture, and artistic accomplishments of the Ottomans.</span></p>\n"

"<p>When you think of Hell, what images fill your imagination? &nbsp;Your mind might first conjure up a monstrous satanic figure, and then you may further fill in the picture with other beastly devils that roam around torturing damned sinners, who in turn cry out with pain and regret.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>And how about the better parts of the Christian&nbsp;afterlife; how do you imagine them? Perhaps the saved are singing songs of joy, angels are fluttering about, and throngs of holy men and women converse and worship God. &nbsp;To some degree, such imaginings have their origins in the Bible. However, in the Christian West, conceptions of the afterlife evolved quite a bit over the centuries. One important late medieval figure who played a key role in shaping the cultural concepts of life after death&mdash;even to the present day&mdash;is Dante Alighieri, the Florentine poet who was born in the 1260s and died in 1321.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his epic poem known as the<em> Divine Comedy</em>, Dante creates a fictional version of himself who&nbsp;travels through the farthest reaches of&nbsp;hell <em>(Inferno)</em>, purgatory<em> (Purgatorio)</em>&nbsp;and paradise<em> (Paradiso)</em>. Many details that he describes along this journey have left a lasting impression on the Western imagination for more than half a millennium. &nbsp;In fact, the rather stereotypical images of the afterlife I described earlier are all represented in his work. But Dante also&nbsp;found novel ways to portray already well-formed concepts, thus further solidifying them while also reshaping them into new guises that would become&nbsp;familiar to countless generations that followed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Because of Dante&#39;s image-driven descriptions, many artists have sought to illustrate his text through a wide variety of media. &nbsp;Almost immediately after his work was completed, illuminators created images to accompany manuscripts of his masterpiece. More than forty illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em> were created before the advent of the printing press (in the late 15th century). &nbsp;When the potential&nbsp;for faster reproductions of books&mdash;including illustrated books&mdash;became a reality, Dante&#39;s imagination, sometimes intertwined with the imagination of an artist rendering a visual interpretation of his words, reached an even larger audience than before. &nbsp;We will look here at two outstanding examples of how Dante&#39;s words fed the creative imagination of visual artists before and shortly after the invention of the printing press. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The influence of art on Dante&#39;s world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before looking at Dante&#39;s influence on the visual arts, however, we need take a little step back in time. &nbsp;The relationship between Dante and the arts was a reciprocal one; images he had seen also greatly influenced his literary vision. Were there any sights, sounds or works of art you saw as a child that you can still easily call to mind today? If you were writing a fictional story that relied heavily on your own imagination, could you see yourself drawing from these vivid sensorial experiences and making them a part of that story? This was the case for Dante.</p>\n"

"<p>Florence was full of artistic marvels well before the Renaissance. &nbsp;Incredible works of art and architecture filled the city well before Dante&#39;s birth in late medieval times. The Florence Baptistery (illustrated above), which Dante fondly referred to in his <em>Comedy</em> as his &quot;bel (beautiful) San Giovanni,&quot;&nbsp;is one such example, which the poet would have known well, even from the days of his youth. The ceiling inside the baptistery is covered with mosaic images that still dazzle visitors today. There are many indications that Dante too was dazzled by the sight. Quite a few correspondences can be discerned between certain descriptions in the <em>Comedy</em> and particular images within this baptistery&mdash;indeed, too many to be mere coincidence. &nbsp;For example, at the end of the <em>Inferno</em>, when Dante&#39;s fictional self&nbsp;reaches the deepest part of Hell and encounters &quot;the emperor of the dolorous kingdom&quot; (Satan),&nbsp;&nbsp;Dante&rsquo;s description is strikingly specific. &nbsp;Satan has three mouths, and &quot;In each of his mouths he was breaking a sinner/&nbsp;with his teeth in the manner of a scutch, so that he made the three suffer at once&quot;&nbsp;(translation by Durling and Martinez)&mdash;just like the image of Satan inside the Florence Baptistery. &nbsp;The link to this mosaic image is just one example of how the visual arts passed from Dante&rsquo;s memory through his imagination and onto the pages of his epic poem.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After a childhood and adolescence no doubt filled with sights of Florentine artistic wonders, Dante&rsquo;s familiarity with the visual arts matured. &nbsp;In <em>Purgatorio </em>XI his understanding of various forms of visual arts and artists is especially evident. &nbsp;Through a conversation between his fictional self and the manuscript illuminator Oderisi da Gubbio, Dante discusses the fading glory of artists, always eclipsed by another&rsquo;s&nbsp;greatness. &nbsp;He writes that just as Franco Bolognese surpassed his master Oderisi in illumination, and Giotto surpassed Cimabue in painting&mdash;in poetry, a certain unnamed poet (that is, Dante) just may have outdone Guido Cavalcanti and Guido Guinizelli.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Dante implies that there are similarities between the written word and the painted picture, as he directly associates these mediums and their practitioners with one another. Certainly, poets like Dante learned from and were influenced by artists, and as we will now see, visual artists were also greatly affected by poets such as this great Florentine.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Yates-Thompson Codex</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the dozens of illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, one of the most outstanding is known as the Yates-Thompson Codex, which is located in the British Library.&nbsp;It was originally carried out for Alfonso V, the king of Aragon, Naples and Sicily, either as a gift or under his commission. &nbsp;The manuscript was produced in Siena in the 1440s, and two illuminators&nbsp;worked&nbsp;on the 112 framed miniatures. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>When you think of Hell, what images fill your imagination? &nbsp;Your mind might first conjure up a monstrous satanic figure, and then you may further fill in the picture with other beastly devils that roam around torturing damned sinners, who in turn cry out with pain and regret.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>And how about the better parts of the Christian&nbsp;afterlife; how do you imagine them? Perhaps the saved are singing songs of joy, angels are fluttering about, and throngs of holy men and women converse and worship God. &nbsp;To some degree, such imaginings have their origins in the Bible. However, in the Christian West, conceptions of the afterlife evolved quite a bit over the centuries. One important late medieval figure who played a key role in shaping the cultural concepts of life after death&mdash;even to the present day&mdash;is Dante Alighieri, the Florentine poet who was born in the 1260s and died in 1321.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his epic poem known as the<em> Divine Comedy</em>, Dante creates a fictional version of himself who&nbsp;travels through the farthest reaches of&nbsp;hell <em>(Inferno)</em>, purgatory<em> (Purgatorio)</em>&nbsp;and paradise<em> (Paradiso)</em>. Many details that he describes along this journey have left a lasting impression on the Western imagination for more than half a millennium. &nbsp;In fact, the rather stereotypical images of the afterlife I described earlier are all represented in his work. But Dante also&nbsp;found novel ways to portray already well-formed concepts, thus further solidifying them while also reshaping them into new guises that would become&nbsp;familiar to countless generations that followed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Because of Dante&#39;s image-driven descriptions, many artists have sought to illustrate his text through a wide variety of media. &nbsp;Almost immediately after his work was completed, illuminators created images to accompany manuscripts of his masterpiece. More than forty illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em> were created before the advent of the printing press (in the late 15th century). &nbsp;When the potential&nbsp;for faster reproductions of books&mdash;including illustrated books&mdash;became a reality, Dante&#39;s imagination, sometimes intertwined with the imagination of an artist rendering a visual interpretation of his words, reached an even larger audience than before. &nbsp;We will look here at two outstanding examples of how Dante&#39;s words fed the creative imagination of visual artists before and shortly after the invention of the printing press. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The influence of art on Dante&#39;s world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before looking at Dante&#39;s influence on the visual arts, however, we need take a little step back in time. &nbsp;The relationship between Dante and the arts was a reciprocal one; images he had seen also greatly influenced his literary vision. Were there any sights, sounds or works of art you saw as a child that you can still easily call to mind today? If you were writing a fictional story that relied heavily on your own imagination, could you see yourself drawing from these vivid sensorial experiences and making them a part of that story? This was the case for Dante.</p>\n"

"<p><span>In ancient Rome equestrian statues of emperors would not have been uncommon sights in the city&mdash;late antique sources suggest that at least 22 of these &ldquo;great horses&rdquo; (<em>equi magni</em>) were to be seen&mdash;as they were official devices for honoring the emperor for singular military and civic achievements. The statues themselves were, in turn, copied in other media, including coins, for even wider distribution. Few examples of these equestrian statues survive from antiquity, however, making the <em>Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius</em> a singular artifact of Roman antiquity, one that has borne quiet witness to the ebb and flow of the city of Rome for nearly 1,900 years. A gilded bronze monument of the 170s C.E. that was originally dedicated to the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, referred to commonly as Marcus Aurelius (reigned 161-180 C.E.), the statue is an important object not only for the study of official Roman portraiture, but also for the consideration of monumental dedications. Further, the&nbsp;use of the statue&nbsp;in the Medieval, Renaissance, modern, and post-modern city of Rome has important implications for the connectivity that exists between the past and the present.</span></p>\n"

"<p>The statue is an over life-size depiction of the emperor elegantly mounted atop his horse while participating in a public ritual or ceremony; the statue stands approximately 4.24 meters tall.

The horse is saddled with a Persian-style saddlecloth of several layers, as opposed to a rigid saddle. It should be noted that the horse is an important and expressive element of the overall composition.</p>\n"

"<p>In the Roman world it was standard practice to create official portrait types of high-ranking officials, such as emperors that would then circulate in various media, notably sculpture in the round and coin portraits. These portrait types are vital in several respects, especially for determining the chronology of monuments and coins, since the portrait types can usually be placed in a fairly accurate and legible chronological order.

"\n"
"<p>Marcus Aurelius became emperor in 161 C.E., when he was forty years of age; this was the occasion for the creation of his third and most important portrait type.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This mature type shows the emperor fully bearded with a full head of tightly curled, voluminous hair; he retains the characteristic oval-shaped face and heavy eyelids from his earlier portraits. His coiffure forms a distinctive arc over his forehead. This third type is known from approximately&nbsp;50 copies.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The statue of the horseman is carefully composed by the artist and depicts a figure that is simultaneously dynamic and a bit passive and removed, by virtue of his facial expression (see image below). The locks of hair are curly and compact and distributed evenly; the beard is also curly, covering the cheeks and upper lip, and is worn longer at the chin. The pose of the body shows the rider&rsquo;s head turned slightly to his right, in the direction of his outstretched right arm. The left hand originally held the reins (no longer preserved) between the index and middle fingers, with the palm facing upwards. Scholars continue to debate whether he originally held some attached figure or object in the palm of the left hand; possible suggestions have included a scepter, a globe, a statue of victory &ndash; but there is no clear indication of any attachment point for such an object. On the left hand the rider does wear the senatorial ring.</p>\n"

"<p>The rider is clad in civic garb, including a short-sleeved tunic that is gathered at the waist by a knotted belt (<em>cingulum</em>). Over the tunic the rider wears a cloak (<em>paludamentum</em>) that is clasped at the right shoulder. On his feet Marcus Aurelius wears the senatorial boots of the patrician class, known as <em>calcei patricii</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation and chronology</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The interpretation and chronology of the equestrian statue must rely on the statue itself, as no ancient literary testimony or other evidence survives to aid in the interpretation. It is obvious that the statue is part of an elaborate public monument, no doubt commissioned to mark an important occasion in the emperor&rsquo;s reign. With that said, however, it must also be noted that scholars continue to debate its precise dating, the occasion for its creation, and its likely original location in the city of Rome.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Starting with the portrait typology it is possible to determine a range of likely dates for the statue&rsquo;s creation. The portrait is clearly an adult type of the emperor, meaning the statue must have been created after 161 C.E., the year of Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; accession and the creation of his third portrait type. This provides a <em>terminus post quem</em>&nbsp;(the limit after which) for the equestrian statue. Art historians have debated whether the portrait head most resembles the Type III or the Type IV portrait. Recent scholarly thinking, based on the work of Klaus Fittschen, holds that the equestrian portrait represents a unique variant of the standard Type III portrait, created as an improvisation by the artist who was commissioned to create the equestrian statue. In the end the precise chronology of the portrait head&mdash;and indeed the typology&mdash;remains a matter of scholarly debate.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"Relief from honorary monument to Marcus Aurelius, 176-180 C.E., marble\n"

The emperor stretches his right hand outward, the palm facing toward the ground; a pose that could be interpreted as the posture of <em>adlocutio</em>, indicating that the emperor is about to speak. However, more likely in this case we may read it as the gesture of clemency (<em>clementia</em>), offered to a vanquished enemy, or of <em>restitutio pacis</em>, the &quot;restoration of peace.&quot;&nbsp;Richard Brilliant has noted that since the emperor appears in civic garb as opposed to the general&rsquo;s armor, the overall impression of the statue is one of peace rather than of the immediate post-war celebration of military victory. Some art historians reconstruct a now-missing barbarian on the right side of the horse, as seen in a surviving panel relief sculpture that originally belonged to a now-lost triumphal arch dedicated to Marcus Aurelius (left). We know that Marcus Aurelius celebrated a triumph in 176 C.E. for his victories over German and Sarmatian tribes, leading some to suggest that year as the occasion for the creation of the equestrian monument.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>History</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The original location of the equestrian monument also remains debated, with some supporting a location on the Caelian Hill near the barracks of the imperial cavalry (equites singulares), while others favor the Campus Martius &nbsp;(a low-lying alluvial plain of the Tiber River)&nbsp;&nbsp;as a possible location. A text known as the <em>Liber Pontificalis</em> that dates to the middle of the tenth century C.E. mentions the equestrian monument, referring to it as &ldquo;<em>caballus Constantini</em>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;horse of Constantine.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to&nbsp;the text, the urban prefect of Rome was condemned following an uprising against Pope John XII and, as punishment, was hung by the hair from the equestrian monument. At this time the equestrian statue was located in the Lateran quarter of the city of Rome near the Lateran Palace, where it may have been since at least the eighth century C.E. Popular theories at the time held that the bearded emperor was in fact Constantine I, thus sparing the statue from being melted down.</p>\n"

"<span class=\"image-caption\">Reverse of Italian &euro; 0.50 coin</span></span>In 1538 the statue was relocated from the Lateran quarter to the Capitoline Hill to become the centerpiece for Michelangelo&rsquo;s new design for the Campidoglio (a piazza, or public square, at the top of the Capitoline hill). The statue was set atop a pedestal at the center of an intricately designed piazza flanked by three palazzi (image above). It became the centerpiece of the main piazza of secular Rome and, as such, an icon of the city, a role that its still retains. The equestrian statue still plays a role as an official symbol of the city of Rome, even being incorporated into the reverse image of the Italian version of the &euro; 0.50 coin (image above). The statue itself remained where Michelangelo positioned it until it was moved indoors in 1981 for conservation reasons; a high-tech copy of the original was placed on the pedestal. The ancient statue is now housed within the Musei Capitolini where it can be visited and viewed today.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius is an enduring monument, one that links the city&rsquo;s many phases, ancient and modern. It has borne witness to the city&rsquo;s imperial glory, post-imperial decline,&nbsp;its Renaissance resurgence, and even its quotidian experience in the twenty-first century. In so doing it reminds us about the role of public art in creating and reinforcing cultural identity as it relates to specific events and locations. In the ancient world the equestrian statue would have evoked powerful memories from the viewer, not only reinforcing the identity and appearance of the emperor but also calling to mind the key events, achievements, and celebrations of his administration. The statue is, like the city, eternal, as reflected by the Romanesco&nbsp;poet Giuseppe Belli who reflects in his sonnet <em>Campidojjo</em> (1830) that the gilded statue is directly linked to the long sweep of Rome&rsquo;s history.</p>\n"

"<p>The rider is clad in civic garb, including a short-sleeved tunic that is gathered at the waist by a knotted belt (<em>cingulum</em>). Over the tunic the rider wears a cloak (<em>paludamentum</em>) that is clasped at the right shoulder. On his feet Marcus Aurelius wears the senatorial boots of the patrician class, known as <em>calcei patricii</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation and chronology</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The interpretation and chronology of the equestrian statue must rely on the statue itself, as no ancient literary testimony or other evidence survives to aid in the interpretation. It is obvious that the statue is part of an elaborate public monument, no doubt commissioned to mark an important occasion in the emperor&rsquo;s reign. With that said, however, it must also be noted that scholars continue to debate its precise dating, the occasion for its creation, and its likely original location in the city of Rome.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Starting with the portrait typology it is possible to determine a range of likely dates for the statue&rsquo;s creation. The portrait is clearly an adult type of the emperor, meaning the statue must have been created after 161 C.E., the year of Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; accession and the creation of his third portrait type. This provides a <em>terminus post quem</em>&nbsp;(the limit after which) for the equestrian statue. Art historians have debated whether the portrait head most resembles the Type III or the Type IV portrait. Recent scholarly thinking, based on the work of Klaus Fittschen, holds that the equestrian portrait represents a unique variant of the standard Type III portrait, created as an improvisation by the artist who was commissioned to create the equestrian statue. In the end the precise chronology of the portrait head&mdash;and indeed the typology&mdash;remains a matter of scholarly debate.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"Relief from honorary monument to Marcus Aurelius, 176-180 C.E., marble\n"
"350 cm (Capitoline Museums, Rome)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/428a3ef45858cc5f9b6b09e71a8dd5ce7b7569c6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"> Relief from honorary monument to Marcus Aurelius, 176-180 C.E., marble 350 cm (Capitoline Museums, Rome)</span></span>The pose of the horseman is also helpful. The emperor stretches his right hand outward, the palm facing toward the ground; a pose that could be interpreted as the posture of <em>adlocutio</em>, indicating that the emperor is about to speak. However, more likely in this case we may read it as the gesture of clemency (<em>clementia</em>), offered to a vanquished enemy, or of <em>restitutio pacis</em>, the &quot;restoration of peace.&quot;&nbsp;Richard Brilliant has noted that since the emperor appears in civic garb as opposed to the general&rsquo;s armor, the overall impression of the statue is one of peace rather than of the immediate post-war celebration of military victory. Some art historians reconstruct a now-missing barbarian on the right side of the horse, as seen in a surviving panel relief sculpture that originally belonged to a now-lost triumphal arch dedicated to Marcus Aurelius (left). We know that Marcus Aurelius celebrated a triumph in 176 C.E. for his victories over German and Sarmatian tribes, leading some to suggest that year as the occasion for the creation of the equestrian monument.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>History</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The original location of the equestrian monument also remains debated, with some supporting a location on the Caelian Hill near the barracks of the imperial cavalry (equites singulares), while others favor the Campus Martius &nbsp;(a low-lying alluvial plain of the Tiber River)&nbsp;&nbsp;as a possible location. A text known as the <em>Liber Pontificalis</em> that dates to the middle of the tenth century C.E. mentions the equestrian monument, referring to it as &ldquo;<em>caballus Constantini</em>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;horse of Constantine.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to&nbsp;the text, the urban prefect of Rome was condemned following an uprising against Pope John XII and, as punishment, was hung by the hair from the equestrian monument. At this time the equestrian statue was located in the Lateran quarter of the city of Rome near the Lateran Palace, where it may have been since at least the eighth century C.E. Popular theories at the time held that the bearded emperor was in fact Constantine I, thus sparing the statue from being melted down.</p>\n"

"<span class=\"image-caption\">Reverse of Italian &euro; 0.50 coin</span></span>In 1538 the statue was relocated from the Lateran quarter to the Capitoline Hill to become the centerpiece for Michelangelo&rsquo;s new design for the Campidoglio (a piazza, or public square, at the top of the Capitoline hill). The statue was set atop a pedestal at the center of an intricately designed piazza flanked by three palazzi (image above). It became the centerpiece of the main piazza of secular Rome and, as such, an icon of the city, a role that its still retains. The equestrian statue still plays a role as an official symbol of the city of Rome, even being incorporated into the reverse image of the Italian version of the &euro; 0.50 coin (image above). The statue itself remained where Michelangelo positioned it until it was moved indoors in 1981 for conservation reasons; a high-tech copy of the original was placed on the pedestal. The ancient statue is now housed within the Musei Capitolini where it can be visited and viewed today.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius is an enduring monument, one that links the city&rsquo;s many phases, ancient and modern. It has borne witness to the city&rsquo;s imperial glory, post-imperial decline,&nbsp;its Renaissance resurgence, and even its quotidian experience in the twenty-first century. In so doing it reminds us about the role of public art in creating and reinforcing cultural identity as it relates to specific events and locations. In the ancient world the equestrian statue would have evoked powerful memories from the viewer, not only reinforcing the identity and appearance of the emperor but also calling to mind the key events, achievements, and celebrations of his administration. The statue is, like the city, eternal, as reflected by the Romanesco&nbsp;poet Giuseppe Belli who reflects in his sonnet <em>Campidojjo</em> (1830) that the gilded statue is directly linked to the long sweep of Rome&rsquo;s history.</p>\n"

The commission for Fallingwater was a personal milestone for the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, since it&nbsp;clearly marked a turning point in his career. After this late-career triumph, the sixty-seven year old would go on to create a series of highly original designs that would validate his claim as &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s greatest architect.&rdquo;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;the greatest architect of the&nbsp;nineteenth-century&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&mdash;Philip Johnson</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mid-1930s were among the darkest years for architecture and architects in American history; the country&rsquo;s financial system had collapsed with the failure of hundreds of banks. Almost no private homes were built. Many of the architectural projects started during the boom of the late 1920s were halted for lack of funds. Now in his sixties, Wright and his new wife Olgivanna were struggling to keep Taliesin, his Wisconsin home and studio, out of foreclosure. Worse still, his peers were beginning to regard Wright as an irrelevant anachronism whose time had passed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1932 Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson opened the &quot;Modern Architecture:&nbsp;International Exhibition&quot; at the newly founded Museum of Modern Art in New York and simultaneously&nbsp;published the book&nbsp;<em>International Style</em>. This was, perhaps, the most influential architectural exhibit ever mounted in the United States and the book became a manifesto for modern architecture and would profoundly affect almost every major architectural project worldwide for the next 30 years. It focused on the work of four great &ldquo;European functionalists&rdquo;&quot;&nbsp;Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and J.J.P. Oud. Wright was largely snubbed.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Hitchcock had praise for his early work, for its &ldquo;many innovations,&quot;&nbsp;but he condemned Wright for a&nbsp;&ldquo;[l]ack of continuity in his development and his unwillingness to absorb the innovations of his contemporaries and his juniors in Europe.&rdquo; Hitchcock insulted Wright further by characterizing him as &ldquo;a rebel by temperament&hellip; [who] refused even the discipline of his own theories.&rdquo; The catalogue calls Wright a &ldquo;half-modern&rdquo; throwback, one of the &ldquo;last representatives of Romanticism.&rdquo;&nbsp;Wright responded by denigrating European Modernism as an &ldquo;evil crusade,&rdquo; a manifestation of &ldquo;totalitarianism.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A fellowship and a commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Wrights devised an architectural apprenticeship program that came to be known as the &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; And among the first candidates was Edgar Kaufmann Jr. who&nbsp;became enamored with Wright after reading his biography. Kaufmann was the son of Pittsburgh department store tycoon Edgar Kaufmann Sr.; whose thirteen story downtown Pittsburgh emporium was reported to be the largest in the world. Kaufmann senior was no stranger to architectural pursuits&mdash;he was&nbsp;involved in numerous public projects and&nbsp;built several stores and homes. Kaufmann&nbsp;let&nbsp;Wright know that he had several civic architectural projects in mind for him. He and his wife Liliane were invited to Taliesin and were duly impressed.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>There are varying accounts regarding the circumstances that brought Kaufmann to offer Wright a chance to design a &ldquo;weekend home&rdquo; in the country; but we know that Wright made his first trip to the site on Bear Run, Pennsylvania in December, 1934. Wright&rsquo;s apprentice Donald Hoppen has spoken of Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;uncanny sense&nbsp;of...genius loci&rdquo;1 (Latin for &quot;spirit of the place&quot;) and from the very beginning, the architect rejected a site that presented a conventional view of the waterfall; instead, he audaciously offered to make the house part of it, stating that the &ldquo;visit to the waterfall in the woods stays with me and a domicile takes shape in my mind to the music of the stream.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>The South-southeast orientation gives the illusion that the stream flows, not alongside the house, but through it.</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Fastest draw in the Midwest</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the most famous tale to come out of the lore of Fallingwater is the improbable story that Wright, after receiving the commission procrastinated for nine months until he was forced to draw up the complete plans while his patron was driving&nbsp;the 140 miles from Milwaukee to Taliesin. However, the essential story is validated by several witnesses. Apprentice Edgar Taffel recalled that after talking with Kaufmann on the phone, Wright &ldquo;briskly emerged from his office...sat down at the table set with the plot plan and started to draw&hellip;The design just poured out of him. &#39;Liliane and E.J. will have tea on the balcony&hellip;they&rsquo;ll cross the bridge to walk in the woods&hellip;&#39;&nbsp;Pencils being used up as fast as we could sharpen them....Erasures, overdrawing, modifying. Flipping sheets back and forth. Then, the bold title across the bottom &lsquo;Fallingwater.&rsquo; A house has to have a name.&rdquo;2&nbsp;There seems to be agreement that the whole process took about two hours.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Organic architecture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Edgar Kaufmann Jr. pointed&nbsp;out that Wright&rsquo;s famous concept of &ldquo;Organic Architecture&rdquo; stems from his Transcendentalist background. The belief that human life is part of nature. Wright even incorporated a rock outcropping that projected above the living room floor into his massive central hearth,&nbsp;further uniting the house with the earth. &ldquo;Can you say&rdquo; Wright challenged his apprentices &ldquo;when your building is&nbsp;<span>complete, that the landscape is more beautiful than it was before?&rdquo;3</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his book, <em>Fallingwater Rising: Frank Lloyd Wright, E. J. Kaufmann, and America&#39;s Most Extraordinary House</em>, Franklin Toker wrote that,&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>this delicate synthesis of nature and the built environment probably counts as the main reason why Fallingwater is such a well-loved work. The contouring of the house into cantilevered ledges responds so sympathetically to the rock strata of the stream banks that it does make Bear Run a more wondrous landscape than it had been before.4</p>\n"

"<p>The Kaufmanns loved Wright&rsquo;s radical proposal to literally suspend the house over the waterfall.

The commission for Fallingwater was a personal milestone for the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, since it&nbsp;clearly marked a turning point in his career. After this late-career triumph, the sixty-seven year old would go on to create a series of highly original designs that would validate his claim as &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s greatest architect.&rdquo;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;the greatest architect of the&nbsp;nineteenth-century&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&mdash;Philip Johnson</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mid-1930s were among the darkest years for architecture and architects in American history; the country&rsquo;s financial system had collapsed with the failure of hundreds of banks. Almost no private homes were built. Many of the architectural projects started during the boom of the late 1920s were halted for lack of funds. Now in his sixties, Wright and his new wife Olgivanna were struggling to keep Taliesin, his Wisconsin home and studio, out of foreclosure. Worse still, his peers were beginning to regard Wright as an irrelevant anachronism whose time had passed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1932 Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson opened the &quot;Modern Architecture:&nbsp;International Exhibition&quot; at the newly founded Museum of Modern Art in New York and simultaneously&nbsp;published the book&nbsp;<em>International Style</em>. This was, perhaps, the most influential architectural exhibit ever mounted in the United States and the book became a manifesto for modern architecture and would profoundly affect almost every major architectural project worldwide for the next 30 years. It focused on the work of four great &ldquo;European functionalists&rdquo;&quot;&nbsp;Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and J.J.P. Oud. Wright was largely snubbed.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Hitchcock had praise for his early work, for its &ldquo;many innovations,&quot;&nbsp;but he condemned Wright for a&nbsp;&ldquo;[l]ack of continuity in his development and his unwillingness to absorb the innovations of his contemporaries and his juniors in Europe.&rdquo; Hitchcock insulted Wright further by characterizing him as &ldquo;a rebel by temperament&hellip; [who] refused even the discipline of his own theories.&rdquo; The catalogue calls Wright a &ldquo;half-modern&rdquo; throwback, one of the &ldquo;last representatives of Romanticism.&rdquo;&nbsp;Wright responded by denigrating European Modernism as an &ldquo;evil crusade,&rdquo; a manifestation of &ldquo;totalitarianism.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A fellowship and a commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Wrights devised an architectural apprenticeship program that came to be known as the &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; And among the first candidates was Edgar Kaufmann Jr. who&nbsp;became enamored with Wright after reading his biography. Kaufmann was the son of Pittsburgh department store tycoon Edgar Kaufmann Sr.; whose thirteen story downtown Pittsburgh emporium was reported to be the largest in the world. Kaufmann senior was no stranger to architectural pursuits&mdash;he was&nbsp;involved in numerous public projects and&nbsp;built several stores and homes. Kaufmann&nbsp;let&nbsp;Wright know that he had several civic architectural projects in mind for him. He and his wife Liliane were invited to Taliesin and were duly impressed.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>There are varying accounts regarding the circumstances that brought Kaufmann to offer Wright a chance to design a &ldquo;weekend home&rdquo; in the country; but we know that Wright made his first trip to the site on Bear Run, Pennsylvania in December, 1934. Wright&rsquo;s apprentice Donald Hoppen has spoken of his Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;uncanny sense&nbsp;of...genius loci&rdquo;1 (Latin for &quot;spirit of the place&quot;) and from the very beginning, the architect rejected a site that presented a conventional view of the waterfall; instead, he audaciously offered to make the house part of it, stating that the &ldquo;visit to the waterfall in the woods stays with me and a domicile takes shape in my mind to the music of the stream.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>The South-southeast orientation gives the illusion that the stream flows, not alongside the house, but through it.</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Fastest draw in the Midwest</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the most famous tale to come out of the lore of Fallingwater is the improbable story that Wright, after receiving the commission procrastinated for nine months until he was forced to draw up the complete plans while his patron was driving&nbsp;the 140 miles from Milwaukee to Taliesin. However, the essential story is validated by several witnesses. Apprentice Edgar Taffel recalled that after talking with Kaufmann on the phone, Wright &ldquo;briskly emerged from his office...sat down at the table set with the plot plan and started to draw&hellip;The design just poured out of him. &#39;Liliane and E.J. will have tea on the balcony&hellip;they&rsquo;ll cross the bridge to walk in the woods&hellip;&#39;&nbsp;Pencils being used up as fast as we could sharpen them....Erasures, overdrawing, modifying. Flipping sheets back and forth. Then, the bold title across the bottom &lsquo;Fallingwater.&rsquo; A house has to have a name.&rdquo;2&nbsp;There seems to be agreement that the whole process took about two hours.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>&ldquo;The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&rdquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1885 the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> published a series of articles by William Thomas Stead that proved a milestone in the history of modern journalism. At the time Parliament was delaying pushing through a bill that would raise the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen. In a bid to force through this piece of legislation, Stead&rsquo;s articles set about exposing the widespread practice of child prostitution, particularly in London. The analogy with the Minotaur myth, comparing these young girls with Athenian virgins, was a powerful trope, but far more compelling were Stead&rsquo;s investigative journalistic tactics, the most controversial involving the purchase for &pound;5 of a thirteen year-old girl, bought from her own parents.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The articles were instrumental in pushing the bill through, ensuring the age of consent was raised, as well as making it a criminal offence to procure girls for prostitution by the administering of drugs, intimidation or fraud. Not all the reforms were progressive, though. Equating child abuse with other forms of sexual behavior, the new laws also criminalized acts of homosexuality, now punishable with a two-year prison sentence, with or without hard labor. Over the months that followed, however, many cases of child abuse were successfully brought to trial, thanks in no small part to Stead&rsquo;s widely circulated articles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Reading them prompted Watts to take up his brush, &quot;to hold up to detestation the bestial and brutal,&rdquo; as he put it, and paint <em>The Minotaur</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beast</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Viewed obliquely, his neck twisted, his face in <em>profil perdu</em> (the figure is viewed from behind, with the face only partially visible), the Minotaur stands on the ramparts of the Labyrinth, gazing, almost longingly, out to sea. On closer inspection one sees to the left the white sail of the ship bearing the seven fair youths and seven maidens from Athens. It is this that has caught his eye. Gripped by destructive impulses he crushes a small bird in his hand. The sail lies on the orthogonal created by his arm emphasizing the fact that they are heading towards a similar fate as the bird&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Painted with startling rapidity in a single morning, Watts rejects the academic finish of his Victorian counterparts, applying the paint with agitated brushstrokes. The form of the figure is built up with layers of red and yellow creating expressive muscular striations, bringing to mind Turner&rsquo;s incarnadine sunsets or perhaps the industrial processes&mdash;the steelworks and blast furnaces&mdash;that have forged this modern Babylon, London.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The angle of the body rhymes visually with the masonry that constrains it, creating a dynamic interplay of curve and line, of raw animal energy set against the geometric exactitude of Daedalus&rsquo;s structure. The frame, too, constrains the figure, emphasizing the verticality of the composition and suggesting at first glance that he is standing on two legs and not four. We soon realize, though, following the musculature of the neck, the curvature of the back and the modeling of the lower-half of the body that it is a bull-headed, centaur-like creature that we are looking at, the human torso emerging from the bulk of a bull&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Dream/painting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One way of tackling the problem is to look at the immediate context of its production. As mentioned, the painting&nbsp;was executed swiftly, Watts&#39;s friend Mrs Russell Barrington recording how it was composed early one morning in response to &ldquo;a painful subject&rdquo; that &ldquo;had filled one of the evening papers.&rdquo; The earliness, the urgency and the likelihood that he had read Stead&rsquo;s article the previous evening are all interesting clues, leading one to the possible conclusion that it is not the text that Watts is illustrating, but the dream he had dreamt after reading it.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is certainly a dreamlike quality to the painting, the symbols used all being highly charged with meaning: the sail, the labyrinth, the Minotaur, the crushed bird, the looping tail. If only Freud were around, we may be tempted to say. But then, of course, he was around and in the years following <em>The Minotaur</em>, was busy penning <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> (1900), in which he proposed that the unconscious mind is structured like a language, the mechanisms of which serve to hide from the dreamer their disturbing thoughts. With this in mind, while the symbolism of the dream/painting purports to illustrate Watts&rsquo;s support for Stead&rsquo;s campaign, the visual contradictions of the image seem out of step with the moral certitudes of the articles, allowing a reading of the painting as a sort of dream displacement in which, while borrowing the symbols of Stead, who himself had borrowed them from the ancient Greeks, Watts is actually saying something entirely different and entirely personal. Whatever meanings or interpretations the painting generates are for the individual viewer to construct. The art historian, Andrew Graham-Dixon, suggests this is a characteristic feature of Watts&rsquo;s later works which whether consciously or otherwise anticipate Modernism, giving form to &ldquo;the troubled subjectivity and anxious relativism of a new era.&rdquo;*</p>\n"

"<p>After her defeat by the Cretans, the story goes, the city of Athens was forced every nine years to send as tribute seven youths and seven maidens. A ship, bearing a black sail, ferried the victims across the Aegean Sea to the land of their subjugators. Once on shore they were sent to the fabled Labyrinth of Daedalus, an impossibly complex maze-like structure, as large as a town.

"\n"
"<h3>Shocked, titillated, and frightened</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Working during the height of the Enlightenment, the so-called &ldquo;Age of Reason,&rdquo; the Swiss-English painter Henry Fuseli (born Johann Heinrich F&uuml;ssli) instead chose to depict darker, irrational forces in his famous painting&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare.</em>&nbsp;In Fuseli&rsquo;s startling composition, a woman bathed in white light stretches across a bed, her arms, neck, and head hanging off the end of the mattress. An apelike figure crouches on her chest while a horse with glowing eyes and flared nostrils emerges from the shadowy background.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting was first displayed at the annual Royal Academy exhibition in London in 1782, where it shocked, titillated, and frightened exhibition visitors and critics. Unlike many of the paintings that were then popular and successful at the Royal Academy exhibitions, Fuseli&rsquo;s <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Nightmare</em>&nbsp;has no moralizing subject. The scene is an invented one, a product of Fuseli&rsquo;s imagination. It certainly has a literary character and the various figures demonstrate Fuseli&rsquo;s broad knowledge of art history, but&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;subject is not drawn from history, the Bible, or literature. The painting&nbsp;has yielded many interpretations and is seen as prefiguring late nineteenth-century psychoanalytic theories regarding dreams and the unconscious&nbsp;(Sigmund Freud allegedly kept a reproduction of the painting on the wall of his apartment in Vienna).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Incubus or&nbsp;mara</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figure that sits upon the woman&rsquo;s chest is often described as an imp or an incubus, a type of spirit said to lie atop people in their sleep or even to have sexual intercourse with sleeping women. Fuseli&rsquo;s painting is suggestive but not explicit, leaving open the possibility that the woman is simply dreaming. Yet, her dream appears to take frightening, physical form in the shapes of the incubus and the horse. According to Fuseli&rsquo;s friend and biographer John Knowles, who saw the first drawing Fuseli made for the composition in 1781, the horse was not present in the drawing but added to the painting later.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Henry Fuseli, The Nightmare (detail), 1781, oil on canvas, 180 × 250 cm (Detroit Institute of Arts)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8a42141a2c1f4466bf81ad3d46f1ec0528456b69.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Incubus (detail),&nbsp;Henry Fuseli, <em>The Nightmare</em>, 1781, oil on canvas, 180 &times; 250 cm (Detroit Institute of Arts</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although it is tempting to understand the painting&rsquo;s title as a punning reference to the horse, the word &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; does not refer to horses. Rather, in the now obsolete definition of the term, a mare is an evil spirit that tortures humans while they sleep. As Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>A Dictionary of the English Language</em>&nbsp;(1755) defined it, a mare or &ldquo;mara, [is] a spirit that, in heathen mythology, was related to torment or to suffocate sleepers. A morbid oppression in the night resembling the pressure of weight upon the breast.&rdquo; Thus, Fuseli&rsquo;s painting may in fact be understood as embodying the physical experience of chest pressure felt during a dream-state.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dark themes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Through his use of composition and chiaroscuro &ndash; the strategic juxtaposition of sharply contrasting light and shadow&mdash;Fuseli heightened the drama and uncertainty of his scene. However, unlike the slightly earlier painting by Joseph Wright of Derby,&nbsp;<em>A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery</em>, which utilized chiaroscuro to symbolize the enlightening power of rational observation, Fuseli&rsquo;s <em>The Nightmare</em>&nbsp;instead shows the futility of light to penetrate or explain the darker realms of the unconscious.&nbsp;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Joseph Wright of Derby, A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery (in which a lamp is put in place of the sun), c. 1763-65, oil on canvas, 4' 10&quot; x 6' 8&quot; (Derby Museums and Art Gallery, Derby)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1d17c733f10579092256abc13f06fbe4ee09b14f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Joseph Wright of Derby, <em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery (in which a lamp is put in place of the sun)</em>, c. 1763-65, oil on canvas, 4&#39; 10&quot; x 6&#39; 8&quot; (Derby Museums and Art Gallery, Derby)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In <em>The Nightmare</em>, the single light source coming in from the right, the curtains and tassels in the background, and the shortened, stage-like foreground also add to the work&rsquo;s theatricality. The red drapery falling off the edge of the bed even suggests a river of blood as it might be symbolically enacted on stage in a play or an opera, adding morbid undertones to the painting&rsquo;s already dark themes.

"<h3>Shocked, titillated, and frightened</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Working during the height of the Enlightenment, the so-called &ldquo;Age of Reason,&rdquo; the Swiss-English painter Henry Fuseli (born Johann Heinrich F&uuml;ssli) instead chose to depict darker, irrational forces in his famous painting&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare.</em>&nbsp;In Fuseli&rsquo;s startling composition, a woman bathed in white light stretches across a bed, her arms, neck, and head hanging off the end of the mattress. An apelike figure crouches on her chest while a horse with glowing eyes and flared nostrils emerges from the shadowy background.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting was first displayed at the annual Royal Academy exhibition in London in 1782, where it shocked, titillated, and frightened exhibition visitors and critics. Unlike many of the paintings that were then popular and successful at the Royal Academy exhibitions, Fuseli&rsquo;s <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Nightmare</em>&nbsp;has no moralizing subject. The scene is an invented one, a product of Fuseli&rsquo;s imagination. It certainly has a literary character and the various figures demonstrate Fuseli&rsquo;s broad knowledge of art history, but&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;subject is not drawn from history, the Bible, or literature. The painting&nbsp;has yielded many interpretations and is seen as prefiguring late nineteenth-century psychoanalytic theories regarding dreams and the unconscious&nbsp;(Sigmund Freud allegedly kept a reproduction of the painting on the wall of his apartment in Vienna).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Incubus or&nbsp;mara</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figure that sits upon the woman&rsquo;s chest is often described as an imp or an incubus, a type of spirit said to lie atop people in their sleep or even to have sexual intercourse with sleeping women. Fuseli&rsquo;s painting is suggestive but not explicit, leaving open the possibility that the woman is simply dreaming. Yet, her dream appears to take frightening, physical form in the shapes of the incubus and the horse. According to Fuseli&rsquo;s friend and biographer John Knowles, who saw the first drawing Fuseli made for the composition in 1781, the horse was not present in the drawing but added to the painting later.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Although it is tempting to understand the painting&rsquo;s title as a punning reference to the horse, the word &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; does not refer to horses. Rather, in the now obsolete definition of the term, a mare is an evil spirit that tortures humans while they sleep. As Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>A Dictionary of the English Language</em>&nbsp;(1755) defined it, a mare or &ldquo;mara, [is] a spirit that, in heathen mythology, was related to torment or to suffocate sleepers. A morbid oppression in the night resembling the pressure of weight upon the breast.&rdquo; Thus, Fuseli&rsquo;s painting may in fact be understood as embodying the physical experience of chest pressure felt during a dream-state.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dark themes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Through his use of composition and chiaroscuro &ndash; the strategic juxtaposition of sharply contrasting light and shadow&mdash;Fuseli heightened the drama and uncertainty of his scene. However, unlike the slightly earlier painting by Joseph Wright of Derby,&nbsp;<em>A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery</em>, which utilized chiaroscuro to symbolize the enlightening power of rational observation, Fuseli&rsquo;s <em>The Nightmare</em>&nbsp;instead shows the futility of light to penetrate or explain the darker realms of the unconscious.&nbsp;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1d17c733f10579092256abc13f06fbe4ee09b14f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Joseph Wright of Derby, <em>A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery (in which a lamp is put in place of the sun)</em>, c. 1763-65, oil on canvas, 4&#39; 10&quot; x 6&#39; 8&quot; (Derby Museums and Art Gallery, Derby)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In <em>The Nightmare</em>, the single light source coming in from the right, the curtains and tassels in the background, and the shortened, stage-like foreground also add to the work&rsquo;s theatricality. The red drapery falling off the edge of the bed even suggests a river of blood as it might be symbolically enacted on stage in a play or an opera, adding morbid undertones to the painting&rsquo;s already dark themes. Throughout his career, Fuseli painted and illustrated scenes from Shakespeare and Milton, and his art has a consistent sense of literary, at times even erudite drama that reveals his classical education (after completing his studies, Fuseli had been ordained as a pastor in the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church before his political activities in Z&uuml;rich effectively forced him into exile in 1761).<br />\n"

A police reporter and social&nbsp;reformer, Riis became intimately familiar with the perils of tenement living and sought to draw attention to the horrendous conditions.

"<h3>Midnight rounds</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At first&nbsp;Riis engaged the services of a photographer who would accompany him as he made&nbsp;his midnight rounds with the police, but ultimately dissatisfied with this arrangement, Riis&nbsp;purchased a box camera and learned to use it. The flash technique used a combination of&nbsp;explosives to achieve the light necessary to take pictures in the dark. The process was new&nbsp;and messy and Riis made adjustments as he went. First, he or his assistants would position the&nbsp;camera on a tripod and then they would ignite the mixture of magnesium flash-powder above&nbsp;the camera lens, causing an explosive noise, great smoke, and a blinding flash of light. Initially,&nbsp;Riis used a revolver to shoot cartridges containing the explosive magnesium flash-powder, but&nbsp;he soon discovered that showing up waving pistols set the wrong tone and substituted a frying pan for&nbsp;the&nbsp;gun, flashing the light on that instead. The process certainly terrified those in the&nbsp;vicinity and also proved dangerous. Riis reported setting two fires in places he visited and nearly&nbsp;blinding himself on one occasion.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Home and work</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is unclear if Riis&rsquo; pictures were totally candid or posed, his agenda of using the stark&nbsp;images to persuade the middle and upper classes that reform was needed is well documented.&nbsp;A major theme of Riis&rsquo; images was the terrible conditions immigrants lived in. In the 1890s,&nbsp;tenement apartments served as both homes and as garment factories. &ldquo;Knee-Pants at Forty-Five&nbsp;Cents a Dozen&mdash;A Ludlow Street Sweater&rsquo;s Shop&rdquo; depicts the intersection of home and work life&nbsp;that was typical. Note&nbsp;the number of people crowded together making knickers and&nbsp;consider their ages, gender, and role. Each worker would be paid by the piece produced and each had his/her own particular role to fill in the shop which was also&nbsp;a family&#39;s&nbsp;home.</p>\n"

"<p>While Riis did not record the names of the people he photographed, he organized his book into&nbsp;ethnic sections, categorizing the images according to the racial and ethnic stereotypes of his&nbsp;age. In this regard, Riis has been criticized for both his bias and reducing&nbsp;those photographed&nbsp;to nameless victims. &ldquo;Knee-Pants,&rdquo; appears in the chapter Jewtown and one can assume that&nbsp;the individuals are part of the large wave of Eastern European Jewish migration that flooded&nbsp;New York at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>\n"

Under the contracting system, the&nbsp;tenement shop would be responsible for assembling the garments, which made up the bulk&nbsp;of the work. By 1910, New York produced 70% of women&rsquo;s clothing and 40% of men&rsquo;s ready-made clothing. That meant that the knee-pants and garments made by the workers captured in&nbsp;this Ludlow Street sweatshop were shipped across the nation. Riis&rsquo; photographs&nbsp;helped make the sweatshop a subject of a national debate and the center of a struggle between&nbsp;workers, owners, consumers, politicians, and social reformers.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Progressive Era</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Riis&rsquo; photographs are part of a larger reform effort undertaken during the Progressive Era,&nbsp;that sought to address the problems of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Progressives&nbsp;worked under the premise that if one studies and documents a problem and proposes and tests&nbsp;solutions, difficulties can ultimately be solved, improving the welfare of society as a whole. Progressives&nbsp;like Riis, Lewis Hine, and Jessie Tarbox Beals pioneered the tradition of documentary&nbsp;photography, using the tool to record and publicize working and housing conditions and a&nbsp;renewed call for reform. These efforts ultimately led to government regulation and the passage&nbsp;of the 1901 Tenement House Law, which mandated new construction and sanitation regulations&nbsp;that improved the access to air, light, and water in all tenement buildings.<br />\n"

"<h3>Midnight rounds</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At first&nbsp;Riis engaged the services of a photographer who would accompany him as he made&nbsp;his midnight rounds with the police, but ultimately dissatisfied with this arrangement, Riis&nbsp;purchased a box camera and learned to use it. The flash technique used a combination of&nbsp;explosives to achieve the light necessary to take pictures in the dark. The process was new&nbsp;and messy and Riis made adjustments as he went. First, he or his assistants would position the&nbsp;camera on a tripod and then they would ignite the mixture of magnesium flash-powder above&nbsp;the camera lens, causing an explosive noise, great smoke, and a blinding flash of light. Initially,&nbsp;Riis used a revolver to shoot cartridges containing the explosive magnesium flash-powder, but&nbsp;he soon discovered that showing up waving pistols set the wrong tone and substituted a frying pan for&nbsp;the&nbsp;gun, flashing the light on that instead. The process certainly terrified those in the&nbsp;vicinity and also proved dangerous. Riis reported setting two fires in places he visited and nearly&nbsp;blinding himself on one occasion.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Home and work</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is unclear if Riis&rsquo; pictures were totally candid or posed, his agenda of using the stark&nbsp;images to persuade the middle and upper classes that reform was needed is well documented.&nbsp;A major theme of Riis&rsquo; images was the terrible conditions immigrants lived in. In the 1890s,&nbsp;tenement apartments served as both homes and as garment factories. &ldquo;Knee-Pants at Forty-Five&nbsp;Cents a Dozen&mdash;A Ludlow Street Sweater&rsquo;s Shop&rdquo; depicts the intersection of home and work life&nbsp;that was typical. Note&nbsp;the number of people crowded together making knickers and&nbsp;consider their ages, gender, and role. Each worker would be paid by the piece produced and each had his/her own particular role to fill in the shop which was also&nbsp;a family&#39;s&nbsp;home.</p>\n"

"<p>While Riis did not record the names of the people he photographed, he organized his book into&nbsp;ethnic sections, categorizing the images according to the racial and ethnic stereotypes of his&nbsp;age. In this regard, Riis has been criticized for both his bias and reducing&nbsp;those photographed&nbsp;to nameless victims. &ldquo;Knee-Pants,&rdquo; appears in the chapter Jewtown and one can assume that&nbsp;the individuals are part of the large wave of Eastern European Jewish migration that flooded&nbsp;New York at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>\n"

"<p>They are likely conversing in Yiddish and share&nbsp;some type of familial or neighborly connection.

Under the contracting system, the&nbsp;tenement shop would be responsible for assembling the garments, which made up the bulk&nbsp;of the work. By 1910, New York produced 70% of women&rsquo;s clothing and 40% of men&rsquo;s ready-made clothing. That meant that the knee-pants and garments made by the workers captured in&nbsp;this Ludlow Street sweatshop were shipped across the nation. Riis&rsquo; photographs&nbsp;helped make the sweatshop a subject of a national debate and the center of a struggle between&nbsp;workers, owners, consumers, politicians, and social reformers.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Progressive Era</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Riis&rsquo; photographs are part of a larger reform effort undertaken during the Progressive Era,&nbsp;that sought to address the problems of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Progressives&nbsp;worked under the premise that if one studies and documents a problem and proposes and tests&nbsp;solutions, difficulties can ultimately be solved, improving the welfare of society as a whole. Progressives&nbsp;like Riis, Lewis Hine, and Jessie Tarbox Beals pioneered the tradition of documentary&nbsp;photography, using the tool to record and publicize working and housing conditions and a&nbsp;renewed call for reform. These efforts ultimately led to government regulation and the passage&nbsp;of the 1901 Tenement House Law, which mandated new construction and sanitation regulations&nbsp;that improved the access to air, light, and water in all tenement buildings.<br />\n"

"<p>Ancient China includes the Neolithic period (10,000 -2,000 B.C.E.), the Shang dynasty (c. 1500-1050 B.C.E.) and the Zhou dynasty (1050-221 B.C.E.). Each age was distinct, but common to each period were grand burials for the elite from which a wealth of objects have been excavated.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Neolithic Period, defined as the age before the use of metal, witnessed a transition from a nomadic existence to one of settled farming. People made different pottery and stone tools in their regional communities. Stone workers employed jade to make prestigious, beautifully polished versions of utilitarian stone tools, such as axes, and also to make implements with possible ceremonial or protective functions. The status of jade continues throughout Chinese history. Pottery also reached a high level with the introduction of the potter&rsquo;s wheel.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Neolithic Liangzhu culture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A group of Neolithic peoples grouped today as the Liangzhu culture lived in the Jiangsu province of China during the third millennium B.C.E. Their jades, ceramics and stone tools were highly sophisticated.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Cong</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>They used two distinct types of ritual jade objects: a disc, later known as a bi, and a tube, later known as a cong. The main types of cong have a square outer section around a circular inner part, and a circular hole, though jades of a bracelet shape also display some of the characteristics of cong. They clearly had great significance, but despite the many theories the meaning and purpose of bi and cong remain a mystery. They were buried in large numbers: one tomb alone had 25 bi and 33 cong.

"<p>Stone rings were being made by the peoples of eastern China as early as the fifth millennium B.C.E. Jade discs have been found carefully laid on the bodies of the dead in tombs of the Hongshan culture (about 3800-2700 B.C.E.), a practice which was continued by later Neolithic cultures. Large and heavy jade discs such as this example, appear to have been an innovation of the Liangzhu culture (about 3000-2000 B.C.E.), although they are not found in all major Liangzhu tombs. The term bi is applied to wide discs with proportionately small central holes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most finely carved discs or bi of the best stone (like the example above) were placed in prominent positions, often near the stomach and the chest of the deceased. Other bi were aligned with the body. Where large numbers of discs are found, usually in small piles, they tend to be rather coarse, made of stone of inferior quality that has been worked in a cursory way.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We do not know what the true significance of these discs was, but they must have had an important ritual function as part of the burial. This is an exceptionally fine example, with the two faces very highly polished.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>On the bank of a cool spring in a lush meadow, a beautiful princess swoons at the sight of a young prince who has stumbled upon her bathing. To an eighteenth century audience, the pair would have been immediately recognizable as Shirin and Khusraw, two of the most famous lovers in the history of Persian literature. Although rendered in oils with a palette indebted to the European&nbsp;Renaissance, the canvas immediately betrays its Islamic origin in its carefully rounded top&mdash;it was&nbsp;designed to fit into the window-shaped niches common in Persian architecture of the period. Putatively titled <em>Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing</em>, the work emerges from a cycle of eight paintings that share a similar style and scale, depicting scenes of hunt as well as events drawn from biblical, Qur&rsquo;anic, and poetic narratives.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>For the love of images</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The content of the painting derives from Nizami&rsquo;s <em>Khamsa</em>, an immensely popular quintet of poems compiled in the thirteenth century. Of the stories recounted, the tale of the love shared between Shirin, a Lebanese princess, and Khusraw, a Sasanian prince, was most celebrated for its romantic appeal and poetic rendering. Nizami&rsquo;s telling of the story emphasizes the power of words and images to inflame the passions of the two lovers. The story is set in motion when Khusraw, aroused by the vivid description of Shirin&rsquo;s beauty by his court painter, Shapur, sends the artist off to lure the princess into his kingdom.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Upon arriving in Lebanon, Shapur baits the princess by planting paintings of Khusraw in her path over the course of three days. At first Shirin&rsquo;s handmaidens destroy Khusraw&rsquo;s image and burn rue (an herb) to break the painting&rsquo;s spell. However, on the third day, Shirin falls in love with the man in the painting and learns of his identity from Shapur. A tremendously popular subject for illustration, Shirin&rsquo;s enchantment by the image of Khusraw underscores the esteemed position held by figural imagery in Persian culture.</p>\n"

Meanwhile, because of conspiring adversaries, Khusraw is forced to flee his palace in disguise and sets a course for Armenia to find Shirin.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What follows is Nizami&rsquo;s account of the fated meeting of the lovers depicted in the present painting:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>For fourteen days and fourteen nights she [Shirin] traveled. Then she came upon an emerald field in which there gleamed a gentle pool&hellip; When she had satisfied herself that she was quite alone, she tethered Shabdiz and prepared to bathe. Beautiful was the whiteness of her skin against the blueness of the water. She loosed her braids and washed her long black hair, and the moon-like reflection of her face was caught in the shallows of the pool (Chelkowski, 25).</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Khusraw&rsquo;s rapid departure from his palace brings him into the vicinity of the princess.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>On the bank of a cool spring in a lush meadow, a beautiful princess swoons at the sight of a young prince who has stumbled upon her bathing. To an eighteenth century audience, the pair would have been immediately recognizable as Shirin and Khusraw, two of the most famous lovers in the history of Persian literature. Although rendered in oils with a palette indebted to the European&nbsp;Renaissance, the canvas immediately betrays its Islamic origin in its carefully rounded top&mdash;it was&nbsp;designed to fit into the window-shaped niches common in Persian architecture of the period. Putatively titled <em>Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing</em>, the work emerges from a cycle of eight paintings that share a similar style and scale, depicting scenes of hunt as well as events drawn from biblical, Qur&rsquo;anic, and poetic narratives.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>For the love of images</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The content of the painting derives from Nizami&rsquo;s <em>Khamsa</em>, an immensely popular quintet of poems compiled in the thirteenth century. Of the stories recounted, the tale of the love shared between Shirin, a Lebanese princess, and Khusraw, a Sasanian prince, was most celebrated for its romantic appeal and poetic rendering. Nizami&rsquo;s telling of the story emphasizes the power of words and images to inflame the passions of the two lovers. The story is set in motion when Khusraw, aroused by the vivid description of Shirin&rsquo;s beauty by his court painter, Shapur, sends the artist off to lure the princess into his kingdom.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Upon arriving in Lebanon, Shapur baits the princess by planting paintings of Khusraw in her path over the course of three days. At first Shirin&rsquo;s handmaidens destroy Khusraw&rsquo;s image and burn rue (an herb) to break the painting&rsquo;s spell. However, on the third day, Shirin falls in love with the man in the painting and learns of his identity from Shapur. A tremendously popular subject for illustration, Shirin&rsquo;s enchantment by the image of Khusraw underscores the esteemed position held by figural imagery in Persian culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Setting the seen</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Heart aflutter and with the aid of Shabdiz, her aunt&rsquo;s famously fast horse, Shirin abandons her companions at the next day&rsquo;s hunt and departs for Persia. Meanwhile, because of conspiring adversaries, Khusraw is forced to flee his palace in disguise and sets a course for Armenia to find Shirin.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What follows is Nizami&rsquo;s account of the fated meeting of the lovers depicted in the present painting:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>For fourteen days and fourteen nights she [Shirin] traveled. Then she came upon an emerald field in which there gleamed a gentle pool&hellip; When she had satisfied herself that she was quite alone, she tethered Shabdiz and prepared to bathe. Beautiful was the whiteness of her skin against the blueness of the water. She loosed her braids and washed her long black hair, and the moon-like reflection of her face was caught in the shallows of the pool (Chelkowski, 25).</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Khusraw&rsquo;s rapid departure from his palace brings him into the vicinity of the princess.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>[H]e ordered his attendants to feed their horses while he rode on alone. Suddenly, he came upon the pool in the emerald field and saw Shirin sitting in the water like a lily. At the sight of her his heart caught fire and burned; he trembled with desire in every limb. Softly he rode toward her and whispered to himself how he would like to have such a beautiful maiden and such a black horse as hers&hellip;Suddenly, Shirin looked up. Startled, she gathered her black hair about her like a cloak, emerged from the pool, dressed, and mounted her horse. At the touch of her heel, Shabdiz carried her off into the shadows of the late afternoon (Chelkowski, 26).</p>\n"

"<p>The central Vairocana Buddha (more than 55 feet high including its pedestal) is flanked on either side by a bodhisattva, &nbsp;a&nbsp;heavenly king, and a thunderbolt holder&nbsp;(vajrapani).&nbsp;Vairocana represents the primordial Buddha who generates and presides over all the Buddhas of the infinite universes that form Buddhist cosmology. This&nbsp;idea&mdash;of the&nbsp;power of one supreme deity over all the others&mdash;resonated in the vast Tang Empire which was dominated by the Emperor at its summit and supported by his subordinate officials. These monumental sculptures intentionally mirrored the political situation. The dignity and imposing presence of Buddha and the sumptuous appearance of his attendant bodhisattvas is significant in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In the images of&nbsp;arhats (worthy monks who have advanced very far in their quest of Enlightenment),&nbsp;who line the walls,&nbsp;the carver sought to create intense realism. Although they are still mortal, arhats&nbsp;are capable of extraordinary deeds both physical and spiritual (they can move at free will through space, can understand the thoughts in people&#39;s minds, and hear the voices of far away speakers). Twenty-nine monks form a procession around the cave perimeter, linking the subject matter to the rising interest in Chan Buddhism (the Meditation School) fostered at court by the empress herself. These&nbsp;portraits record&nbsp;the lineage of the great patriarchs who transmitted the Buddhist doctrine.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Sovereignty and iconography</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Foreign rulers of the Northern Wei, yearning for assimilation and control, made use of Buddhist images for authority and power. Tang dynasty leaders thrived during China&rsquo;s golden age, asserting their sovereignty with the assistance of Buddhist iconography. Today you can visit the stunning limestone remains in Luoyang, New York City, and Kansas City.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Tang dynasty (618&ndash;907 C.E.)&nbsp;is considered the age of &quot;international Buddhism.&quot; Many Chinese, Indian, Central Asian and East Asian monks traveled throughout Asia. The centers of Buddhism in China were invigorated by these travels, and important developments in Buddhist thought and practice originated in China at this time.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The central Vairocana Buddha (more than 55 feet high including its pedestal) is flanked on either side by a bodhisattva, &nbsp;a&nbsp;heavenly king, and a thunderbolt holder&nbsp;(vajrapani).&nbsp;Vairocana represents the primordial Buddha who generates and presides over all the Buddhas of the infinite universes that form Buddhist cosmology. This&nbsp;idea&mdash;of the&nbsp;power of one supreme deity over all the others&mdash;resonated in the vast Tang Empire which was dominated by the Emperor at its summit and supported by his subordinate officials. These monumental sculptures intentionally mirrored the political situation. The dignity and imposing presence of Buddha and the sumptuous appearance of his attendant bodhisattvas is significant in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In the images of&nbsp;arhats (worthy monks who have advanced very far in their quest of Enlightenment),&nbsp;who line the walls,&nbsp;the carver sought to create intense realism. Although they are still mortal, arhats&nbsp;are capable of extraordinary deeds both physical and spiritual (they can move at free will through space, can understand the thoughts in people&#39;s minds, and hear the voices of far away speakers). Twenty-nine monks form a procession around the cave perimeter, linking the subject matter to the rising interest in Chan Buddhism (the Meditation School) fostered at court by the empress herself. These&nbsp;portraits record&nbsp;the lineage of the great patriarchs who transmitted the Buddhist doctrine.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Sovereignty and iconography</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Foreign rulers of the Northern Wei, yearning for assimilation and control, made use of Buddhist images for authority and power. Tang dynasty leaders thrived during China&rsquo;s golden age, asserting their sovereignty with the assistance of Buddhist iconography. Today you can visit the stunning limestone remains in Luoyang, New York City, and Kansas City.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Cassatt&rsquo;s close friend, Edgar Degas, was a great admirer of Japanese art and had recently seen the exhibition with Camille Pissaro. Cassatt was spellbound. In a letter written that week to her friend, the painter Berthe Morisot, she wrote, &ldquo;You who want to make color prints wouldn&rsquo;t dream of anything more beautiful.

"\n"
"<p>This drypoint etching, <em>The Coiffure</em>,&nbsp;of a woman adjusting her hair is one of the hundreds that Mary Cassatt made in her in-home studio in the summer and fall of 1890 and in the winter of 1891. It was inspired in part by a woodblock print in her personal collection, Kitagawa Utamaro&rsquo;s boudoir image of the daughter of a prosperous Edo businessman, <em>Takashima Ohisa Using Two Mirrors to Observe Her Coiffure</em> (above).&nbsp;<em>La Coiffure </em>also&nbsp;has its art historical roots in Old Master paintings of women bathing and the odalisque though it departs from those conventional models to become a tightly crafted exercise in form and composition.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The word &ldquo;la coiffure&rdquo; evokes a precise image, one of wealthy women in glamorous settings. The ritual of grooming, dressing, and preparing one&rsquo;s hair from the seventeenth and eighteenth century court days of Anne of Austria and Marie Antoinette was passed down to nineteenth-century ideals of femininity and beauty.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Georges Girard, &quot;La Coiffure Française Illustrée,” c. 1900 \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8129476b3e707198e087d5ae1243a824907b94d8.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Georges Girard, &quot;La Coiffure Fran&ccedil;aise Illustr&eacute;e,&rdquo; c. 1900 </span></span>To wear an elaborate hairstyle such as those depicted in this magazine illustration by George Girard, one needed to have a maid to help with one&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;La coiffure&rdquo; was part of a specific lifestyle. Yet the woman in Cassatt&rsquo;s print is tending to her hair alone. Perhaps what we are seeing is a working woman getting ready to start her day.&nbsp;<span>The counterpoint of the print&rsquo;s title and the reality of its subject matter characterizes the ironic tension within the image.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The woman&nbsp;in Cassatt&#39;s <em>La Coiffure</em>&nbsp;sits in a plush armchair in front of mirror, her head focused downward, her back arched, as she adjusts her bun. The voyeuristic element to the scene is drawn from precedents in works by Rembrandt (<em>Bathsheba at Her Bath</em>, 1654) and Ingres (<em>La Grand Odalisque</em>, 1814), which Cassatt studied at the Louvre when she was a young student in the mid 1860s.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, La Grande Odalisque, 1814, Oil on canvas, 36&quot; x 63&quot; / 91 x 162 cm (Musée du Louvre, Paris)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2aa003ff4673deef046e886de67f5b769de9508d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, <em>La Grande Odalisque,</em> 1814, oil on canvas, 36&quot; x 63&quot; / 91 x 162 cm (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The woman in </span><em>La Coiffure</em><span>, unlike Rembrandt&rsquo;s </span><em>Bathsheba</em><span> or Ingres&rsquo; </span><em>Odalisque</em><span>, is not sexualized. Though her breasts are exposed, her chest and the details of her body are deliberately muted into an overall structure of curves and crisp lines. This is&nbsp;an exercise in clarity and tone where the subject, the woman&rsquo;s body, is a compositional element in</span><span>&nbsp;the picture&mdash;</span><span>as vividly realized as the other significant patterns of the room&mdash;the wallpaper, the fabric of the armchair, and the carpet.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As the viewer, we are placed at a slight leftward angle from the woman in the chair so that we see her through her reflection in the mirror while she is looking away from it. The downward gaze ia&nbsp;similar to that of the model in the Utamaro, is done partly in homage to the modesty of the female subject in the <em>ukiyo-e</em> prints (artists were always aware that their works were made for a male-dominated market and designed them to be enticing) and partly as a study of shape and line,&nbsp;so that the viewer, realizing that he or she is not looking at a psychological portrait, could focus more intently on the compositional elements of the work.&nbsp;The prints provided artists with an opportunity to showcase their skill in concision&mdash;using no more than is necessary to convey an idea&mdash;the way a haiku poet showcases similar skill within the three lines and seventeen syllables of the poem</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The curve of the woman&rsquo;s sloping back and neck echoes the curves of the chair which stand in contrast to the vertical lines of the mirror&mdash;a compositional counterpoint that further enhances the tension within the tight composition. The limited color palette of shades of rose, brown, and white, enables us to focus&nbsp;closely on the form and clarity of line. It also mimics the quality of pastels, which Cassatt, like her friend Edgar Degas, often liked to use. Through the process of the drypoint and aquatint etching, <em>La Coiffure</em> combines Cassatt&rsquo;s propensity for hazy shading and soft tones with a bold sharpness in line allowing the artist to integrate the qualities of two disparate media.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Edgar Degas, At the Mirror, 1885-86, pastel (San Diego Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c2db7a7894e3c6c92b5abb9f4947b3900b1acceb.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Edgar Degas, <em>At the Mirror</em>, 1885-86, pastel (San Diego Museum of Art)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Her desire to emulate the haziness, sensual, and&nbsp;suggestive possibilities of pastels is what motivated Cassatt not to use woodblock printing but intaglio. First, Cassatt carved her designs onto a smooth copper plate with a fine metal needle.&nbsp;Then the plate would be dusted with a powdered resin and heated until the resin melted in tiny mounds that hardened as they cooled. Acid was then added on to the metal plate biting the channels along the resin droplets. The deeper penetration of acid produced richer, darker tones, while a lighter application of acid produced lighter shades of color and a variety of nuanced gradients could be generated within a single print. Once Cassatt had replicated a certain number of images from a plate, she would incise the plate with a needle so that no one could use the same image again.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Cassatt was inspired in part by some of Degas&rsquo; pastels of women grooming. In Cassatt&rsquo;s prints, the time-honored boudoir scenes we see in Titian and Bellini become de-eroticized and re-appropriated as skilled exercises in form, shading, and line. In the spirit of <em>ukiyo-e</em> and Impressionism, these prints capture fugitive, fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Cassatt&rsquo;s motivation in making the prints was to make her art more accessible for a large audience. She believed that everyone, regardless of income or social position, should be able to experience art and to own works they enjoy:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>I believe [nothing] will inspire a taste for art more than the possibility of having it in the home. I should like to feel that amateurs in America could have an example of my work, a print or an etching, for a few dollars. That is what they do in France. It is not left to the rich alone to buy art; the people&mdash;even the poor&mdash;have taste and buy according to their means, and here they can always find something they can afford. [2]</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This philosophy of art for the masses wasn&rsquo;t always popular with Mary Cassatt&rsquo;s contemporaries, like John Singer Sargent and the art historian Vernon Lee (Violet Paget), who viewed Cassatt&rsquo;s printmaking as a dilution of her precious talent. Yet Cassatt understood that as the world was changing with the twentieth century&rsquo;s new industries and technology, more and more people would have the income, education, and ability to experience art in ways they hadn&rsquo;t been able to before.&nbsp;The proliferative possibilities of the print and its evocative potential to convey so much in such a small space was just the art form to reach a wider&nbsp;audience.&nbsp;</p>\n"

It was inspired in part by a woodblock print in her personal collection, Kitagawa Utamaro&rsquo;s boudoir image of the daughter of a prosperous Edo businessman, <em>Takashima Ohisa Using Two Mirrors to Observe Her Coiffure</em> (above).&nbsp;<em>La Coiffure </em>also&nbsp;has its art historical roots in Old Master paintings of women bathing and the odalisque though it departs from those conventional models to become a tightly crafted exercise in form and composition.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The word &ldquo;la coiffure&rdquo; evokes a precise image, one of wealthy women in glamorous settings. The ritual of grooming, dressing, and preparing one&rsquo;s hair from the seventeenth and eighteenth century court days of Anne of Austria and Marie Antoinette was passed down to nineteenth-century ideals of femininity and beauty.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Georges Girard, &quot;La Coiffure Française Illustrée,” c. 1900 \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8129476b3e707198e087d5ae1243a824907b94d8.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Georges Girard, &quot;La Coiffure Fran&ccedil;aise Illustr&eacute;e,&rdquo; c. 1900 </span></span>To wear an elaborate hairstyle such as those depicted in this magazine illustration by George Girard, one needed to have a maid to help with one&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;La coiffure&rdquo; was part of a specific lifestyle. Yet the woman in Cassatt&rsquo;s print is tending to her hair alone. Perhaps what we are seeing is a working woman getting ready to start her day.&nbsp;<span>The counterpoint of the print&rsquo;s title and the reality of its subject matter characterizes the ironic tension within the image.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The woman&nbsp;in Cassatt&#39;s <em>La Coiffure</em>&nbsp;sits in a plush armchair in front of mirror, her head focused downward, her back arched, as she adjusts her bun. The voyeuristic element to the scene is drawn from precedents in works by Rembrandt (<em>Bathsheba at Her Bath</em>, 1654) and Ingres (<em>La Grand Odalisque</em>, 1814), which Cassatt studied at the Louvre when she was a young student in the mid 1860s.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>The woman in </span><em>La Coiffure</em><span>, unlike Rembrandt&rsquo;s </span><em>Bathsheba</em><span> or Ingres&rsquo; </span><em>Odalisque</em><span>, is not sexualized. Though her breasts are exposed, her chest and the details of her body are deliberately muted into an overall structure of curves and crisp lines. This is&nbsp;an exercise in clarity and tone where the subject, the woman&rsquo;s body, is a compositional element in</span><span>&nbsp;the picture&mdash;</span><span>as vividly realized as the other significant patterns of the room&mdash;the wallpaper, the fabric of the armchair, and the carpet.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As the viewer, we are placed at a slight leftward angle from the woman in the chair so that we see her through her reflection in the mirror while she is looking away from it. The downward gaze ia&nbsp;similar to that of the model in the Utamaro, is done partly in homage to the modesty of the female subject in the <em>ukiyo-e</em> prints (artists were always aware that their works were made for a male-dominated market and designed them to be enticing) and partly as a study of shape and line,&nbsp;so that the viewer, realizing that he or she is not looking at a psychological portrait, could focus more intently on the compositional elements of the work.&nbsp;The prints provided artists with an opportunity to showcase their skill in concision&mdash;using no more than is necessary to convey an idea&mdash;the way a haiku poet showcases similar skill within the three lines and seventeen syllables of the poem</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The curve of the woman&rsquo;s sloping back and neck echoes the curves of the chair which stand in contrast to the vertical lines of the mirror&mdash;a compositional counterpoint that further enhances the tension within the tight composition. The limited color palette of shades of rose, brown, and white, enables us to focus&nbsp;closely on the form and clarity of line. It also mimics the quality of pastels, which Cassatt, like her friend Edgar Degas, often liked to use. Through the process of the drypoint and aquatint etching, <em>La Coiffure</em> combines Cassatt&rsquo;s propensity for hazy shading and soft tones with a bold sharpness in line allowing the artist to integrate the qualities of two disparate media.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Edgar Degas, At the Mirror, 1885-86, pastel (San Diego Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c2db7a7894e3c6c92b5abb9f4947b3900b1acceb.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Edgar Degas, <em>At the Mirror</em>, 1885-86, pastel (San Diego Museum of Art)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Her desire to emulate the haziness, sensual, and&nbsp;suggestive possibilities of pastels is what motivated Cassatt not to use woodblock printing but intaglio. First, Cassatt carved her designs onto a smooth copper plate with a fine metal needle.&nbsp;Then the plate would be dusted with a powdered resin and heated until the resin melted in tiny mounds that hardened as they cooled. Acid was then added on to the metal plate biting the channels along the resin droplets. The deeper penetration of acid produced richer, darker tones, while a lighter application of acid produced lighter shades of color and a variety of nuanced gradients could be generated within a single print. Once Cassatt had replicated a certain number of images from a plate, she would incise the plate with a needle so that no one could use the same image again.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Cassatt was inspired in part by some of Degas&rsquo; pastels of women grooming. In Cassatt&rsquo;s prints, the time-honored boudoir scenes we see in Titian and Bellini become de-eroticized and re-appropriated as skilled exercises in form, shading, and line. In the spirit of <em>ukiyo-e</em> and Impressionism, these prints capture fugitive, fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Cassatt&rsquo;s motivation in making the prints was to make her art more accessible for a large audience. She believed that everyone, regardless of income or social position, should be able to experience art and to own works they enjoy:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>I believe [nothing] will inspire a taste for art more than the possibility of having it in the home. I should like to feel that amateurs in America could have an example of my work, a print or an etching, for a few dollars. That is what they do in France. It is not left to the rich alone to buy art; the people&mdash;even the poor&mdash;have taste and buy according to their means, and here they can always find something they can afford. [2]</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This philosophy of art for the masses wasn&rsquo;t always popular with Mary Cassatt&rsquo;s contemporaries, like John Singer Sargent and the art historian Vernon Lee (Violet Paget), who viewed Cassatt&rsquo;s printmaking as a dilution of her precious talent. Yet Cassatt understood that as the world was changing with the twentieth century&rsquo;s new industries and technology, more and more people would have the income, education, and ability to experience art in ways they hadn&rsquo;t been able to before.&nbsp;The proliferative possibilities of the print and its evocative potential to convey so much in such a small space was just the art form to reach a wider&nbsp;audience.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>A Luncheon with Fur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The story behind the creation of <em>Object</em>, an ordinary cup, spoon, and saucer wrapped evocatively in gazelle fur, has been told so many times its importance in modernist history transcends the fact it might be apocryphal (of dubious authenticity). The twenty-two year old Basel-born artist, Meret Oppenheim, had been in Paris for four years when, one day, she was at a caf&eacute; with Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar. Oppenheim was wearing a brass bracelet covered in fur when Picasso and Maar, who were admiring it, proclaimed, &ldquo;Almost anything can be covered in fur!&rdquo; As Oppenheim&rsquo;s tea grew cold, she jokingly asked the waiter for &ldquo;more fur.&rdquo; Inspiration struck&mdash;Oppenheim is said to have gone straight from the caf&eacute; to a store where she purchased the cup, saucer, and spoon used in this piece. This amusing story belies the importance of Object and the critical acclaim and public fascination that has elevated it to point where it has become the definitive surrealist object...ultimately to Oppenheim&rsquo;s dismay.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What Is a Surrealist Object?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Oppenheim&rsquo;s <em>Object</em> was created at a moment when sculpted objects and assemblages had become prominent features of Surrealist art practice. In 1937, British art critic Herbert Read emphasized that all Surrealist objects were representative of an idea and Salvador Dal&iacute; described some of them as &ldquo;objects with symbolic function.&rdquo; In other words, how might an otherwise typical, functional object be modified so it represents something deeply personal and poetic? How might it, in Freudian terms, resonate as a sublimation of internal desire and aspiration? Such physical manifestations of our internal psyches were indicative of a <em>surreality</em>, or the point in which external and internal realities united, as described by Andr&eacute; Breton (one of Surrealism&rsquo;s founders and theorists) in his first <em>Manifesto of Surrealism</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Visceral Responses</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What, then, do we make of this set of be-furred tableware? Interpretations vary wildly. The art historian Whitney Chadwick has described it as linked to the Surrealist&rsquo;s love of alchemical transformation by turning cool, smooth ceramic and metal into something warm and bristley, while many scholars have noted the fetishistic qualities of the fur-lined set&mdash;as the fur imbues these functional, hand-held objects with sexual connotations. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In a 1936 issue of the <em>New Yorker Magazine</em>, it was reported that a woman fainted &ldquo;right in front of the fur-bearing cup and saucer [while it was on exhibit at MoMA]. &ldquo;She left no name with the attendants who revived her - only a vague feeling of apprehension.&rdquo;* Such visceral reactions to Oppenheim&rsquo;s sculpture come closest, perhaps, to what were likely the artist&rsquo;s aspirations. In an interview later in life, Oppenheim described her creations as &ldquo;not an illustration of an idea, but the thing itself.&rdquo;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Unlike Read and Dal&iacute;, Oppenheim stresses the physicality of <em>Object</em>, reinforcing the way we can readily imagine the feeling of the fur while drinking from the cup, and using the saucer and spoon. The frisson we experience when china is unexpectedly wrapped in fur is based on our familiarity with both, and the fur requires us to extend our sensory experiences to fully appreciate the work. <em>Object</em> insists we imagine what sipping warm tea from this cup feels like, how the bristles would feel upon our lips. &nbsp;With Oppenheim&rsquo;s elegant creation, how we understand those visceral memories, how we create metaphors and symbols out of this act of tactile extension, is entirely open to interpretation by each individual, which is, in many ways, the whole point of Surrealism itself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Presentation Problems</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In spite of our individual response, the interpretation of <em>Object</em> has been complicated by the ways it was assigned meaning by others. When <em>Object</em> was finished, Oppenheim submitted it to Breton for an exhibition of Surrealist objects at the Charles Ratton Gallery in Paris in 1936. &nbsp;However, while Oppenheim preferred a non-descriptive title, Breton took the liberty of titling the piece <em>Le D&eacute;jeneur en fourrure</em>, or <em>Luncheon in Fur</em>. &nbsp;This title is a play on two nineteenth-century works: &Eacute;douard Manet&rsquo;s infamous modernist painting <em>Luncheon on the Grass (Le D&eacute;jeneur sur l&rsquo;herbe)</em> and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch&rsquo;s erotic novel <em>Venus in Furs</em>. With these two references, Breton forces an explicit sexualized meaning onto <em>Object</em>. Recall that the original inspiration for this work was implicitly practical: when Oppenheim asked the waiter for more fur for her cooling teacup, it was suggested as a way to keep her tea warm, and not necessarily as overtly sexual.<br />\n"

However, when Oppenheim later described <em>Das Paar</em> (with the laces untied), she stated it was an &ldquo;odd unisexual pair: two shoes, unobserved at night, doing &lsquo;forbidden&rsquo; things.&rdquo; She expressly assigned no gender, and suggests the &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; acts already taking place between anthropomorphized shoes. She takes a more literal approach, the shoes as expressive things in themselves, rather than symbolically resonant of something else.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>Dangerous Success</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Yet, the early acclaim for the fur-covered <em>Object</em> had a negative effect on Oppenheim&rsquo;s early career. &nbsp;When it was purchased by The Museum of Modern Art and featured in their influential 1936-37 exhibition &quot;Fantastic Art, Dada, and Surrealism&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;visitors &nbsp;declared it the &ldquo;quintessential&rdquo; Surrealist object.

It was only later when she re-emerged, and began publicly showing new paintings and objects with renewed vigor and confidence, that she began reclaiming some of the intent of her work. When she was given an award for her work by the City of Basel, she touched upon this in her acceptance speech: &ldquo;I think it is the duty of a woman to lead a life that expresses her disbelief in the validity of the taboos that have been imposed upon her kind for thousands of years. Nobody will give you freedom; you have to take it.&rdquo;</p>\n"

When she was given an award for her work by the City of Basel, she touched upon this in her acceptance speech: &ldquo;I think it is the duty of a woman to lead a life that expresses her disbelief in the validity of the taboos that have been imposed upon her kind for thousands of years. Nobody will give you freedom; you have to take it.&rdquo;</p>\n"

"<p>The emancipation of European&nbsp;Jews from ghettos became a benchmark of sorts indicating&nbsp;a nation&rsquo;s transformation from the medieval to the modern.&nbsp;Upon the formation of a secular nation, French Jews received civil rights in 1791 and 1792. Other European nations followed throughout the 19th century. National communities distanced themselves from old forms of Christianity, and they tolerated Jews, albeit with reservations.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish enlightenment (<em>Haskalah</em>)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Germany, which did not become a&nbsp;unified nation until 1871, Jews were not granted full equality. Rights depended on local municipalities and in some places, Jews were awarded rights only to have them taken away soon after. It is no coincidence that Germany was the birthplace of Reform Judaism.&nbsp;Progressive thinkers sought to transform Judaism from within when they could not stem prejudice against Jews from without.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Moses Mendelssohn &nbsp;pioneered the Jewish Enlightenment, or <em>Haskalah</em>, which advocated many of the same ideas about freedom and equal rights as those that&nbsp;Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant explored.&nbsp;Mendelssohn openly discussed the ways that Jews could live in a multi-religious society. &ldquo;Adopt the mores and constitution of the country in which you find yourself,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but be steadfast in upholding the religion of your fathers, too.&rdquo;*&nbsp;In subsequent generations, many Jews&mdash;among them, Karl Marx&rsquo;s parents&mdash;found it easier simply to convert to Christianity and live publicly as Christians in order to access jobs, property, and other basic rights.</p>\n"

"<h3>Reform movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Isador Kaufmann, Man with Fur Hat, c. 1910, Vienna (The Jewish Museum, New York). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/47cb3f02e63fb844d162d5eb84bf5f935caddc99.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Isador Kaufmann, <em>Man with Fur Hat</em>, c. 1910, Vienna (The Jewish Museum, New York).&nbsp;&ldquo;Kaufmann&rsquo;s portraits of religiously devout Jews conveyed aspects of Jewish tradition that his audience of acculturated Jews and non-Jews would understand. Here, the sitters orthodoxy is indicated by his fur-trimmed shtraymel (hat) and black kapote (coat). Hung in well-appointed parlors....they...provided a connection to Jewish heritage by linking the world of cosmopolitan Vienna to a traditional lifestyle that endured outside the capital.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/man-with-fur-hat/ZAHnngZnzTGp6A?projectId=art-project\">Source</a></span></span>But there was another answer to the paradox posed by modernity.&nbsp;Inspired by Mendelssohn, Jewish questioners throughout German-speaking lands in the early nineteenth century developed the Reform movement.&nbsp;These reformers believed that their mission was to bring Judaism in line with modern thought; they also promoted the idea that prayers should be chanted in the local language rather than in Hebrew.&nbsp;They encouraged rabbis to look beyond the Talmud and Torah for guidance. Reformers spurned the idea that the past could dictate a way of life in an increasingly secular and&nbsp;industrial&nbsp;context.&nbsp;They modeled many of their religious practices after German Christians&nbsp;encouraging&nbsp;&ldquo;decorum&rdquo; in synagogue, introducing&nbsp;music similar to that heard in churches, and many even wanted to switch the Sabbath to Sunday. They wanted to remain Jews, while highlighting Judaism&rsquo;s similarities with Christianity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Orthodox movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These efforts infuriated traditionalists, who then reacted with steadfast conservatism.&nbsp; Some traditional rabbis had long opposed emancipation, but in response to the Reformers, a group of adherents to <em>Halakhah </em>codified the new Orthodox movement.&nbsp;They opposed many of the secular cultural forms that Judaism took in the coming decades: the Yiddishist movement, Zionism, and any other divergences from strict Halakhah. Some insisted that established customs not grounded in Jewish law should take on the weight of <em>Halakhah</em>&mdash;this is why some groups continue to dress and speak like their ancestors from a century ago or more.&nbsp; These extreme forms of observance are as much a product of modernity as Reform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Hasidic Judaism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Eastern Europe, another religious movement, called Hasidism, gained traction parallel to Reform and Orthodoxy.&nbsp;Founded in the eighteenth century by a rabbi and mystic who called himself Israel Baal Shem Tov, Hasidic Judaism grew out of a populist reaction to the elitism of the traditional Talmudic academy. Hasidic Judaism focuses on mystical interpretations of holy texts and the potential for uneducated Jews to experience holiness. The movement spread rapidly across Eastern and Central Europe. Hasidism&nbsp;gave rise to opposition from at least two sides: the traditional rabbinic legal structures that revolved around organized Torah study, and the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; Jews intent on both escaping the oppressive framework of the traditional Jewish family and acculturating into European society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In spite of Hasidic Judaism&rsquo;s strained history with what came to be known as Orthodoxy, it has become harder to distinguish stringent Orthodox Jews from their Hasidic counterparts. As Reform Judaism gained popularity, the two groups joined forces in support of Halakhah and in opposition to radical reform. Known for their distinctive dress (beards, fur hats, sidelocks, and caftans for men), Hasidim are among the most visible Jewish groups.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Zionism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Several events from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries proved that Jews were not welcomed as equals. In Russia, violent pogroms and economic instability pushed over two million people to emigrate&nbsp;in the 1880s. The vast majority fled to North America, and a small fraction of pioneers traveled to Palestine, the site of ancient Judaism&rsquo;s origins. Some Jewish leaders, responding to the growing nationalism and antisemitism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, followed Theodor Herzl&nbsp;who advocated for a type of&nbsp;secular Jewish nationalism, a return to the biblical homeland of the Jewish people.&nbsp;Religious Jews had prayed facing Jerusalem and called for a Messianic return to the Land of Israel since the Second Temple was destroyed. But the modern political movement, known as Zionism, united the religious impulse to &ldquo;return&rdquo; with&nbsp;secular ideas about constructing a European-style nation for Jews.&nbsp;It is important to note that Zionism was but one form of Jewish nationalism that took hold in the nineteenth century. Some Jews fought for territorial and political autonomy on different parts of the globe, others fought for cultural autonomy in the nations where they lived. These Diaspora nationalist movements mostly disappeared in 1948 when Israel became an&nbsp;independent state.</p>\n"

"<h3>Holocaust</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;The antisemite creates the Jew,&rdquo; wrote the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; Antisemitism had generated a false image of what a Jew is, making Jews seem like a social danger for the majority of Europeans. After World War I, liberal democracies everywhere appeared to be failing.&nbsp;The idea that Jews were responsible for social and economic crises convinced many&nbsp;to use race and ethnicity as a test to determine who&nbsp;belonged and who&nbsp;ought to be excluded.&nbsp;It was in this climate that the Nazi party was elected to power in 1933.&nbsp;Combining their expansionist vision with&nbsp;spurious theories of racial purity, the Germans quickly came to control most of central and eastern Europe.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Genocide became an everyday phenomenon&mdash;the Nuremburg Laws forced Jews to identify themselves with a badge, and criminalized sexual intimacy between Jews and gentiles. Laws were passed across Europe and the Mediterranean that excluded Jews from certain professions and the right to attend school.&nbsp;Citizenship was revoked and many people were&nbsp;forced&nbsp;from their homes into overcrowded wards.&nbsp;Inspired by the medieval ghetto, the Nazis went further&mdash;killing Jews by restricting food and medicine, packing thousands into spaces fit for far fewer, and, eventually, forbidding Jews to leave at all. Working in collaboration with governments across Europe, Nazi officials enacted a &ldquo;Final Solution&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Jewish Question&rdquo; in early 1942.&nbsp;Jews were forcibly&nbsp;gathered and shipped to local concentration camps and to death camps in Poland and Russia.&nbsp;Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>The emancipation of European&nbsp;Jews from ghettos became a benchmark of sorts indicating&nbsp;a nation&rsquo;s transformation from the medieval to the modern.&nbsp;Upon the formation of a secular nation, French Jews received civil rights in 1791 and 1792. Other European nations followed throughout the 19th century. National communities distanced themselves from old forms of Christianity, and they tolerated Jews, albeit with reservations.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish enlightenment (<em>Haskalah</em>)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Germany, which did not become a&nbsp;unified nation until 1871, Jews were not granted full equality. Rights depended on local municipalities and in some places, Jews were awarded rights only to have them taken away soon after. It is no coincidence that Germany was the birthplace of Reform Judaism.&nbsp;Progressive thinkers sought to transform Judaism from within when they could not stem prejudice against Jews from without.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Moses Mendelssohn &nbsp;pioneered the Jewish Enlightenment, or <em>Haskalah</em>, which advocated many of the same ideas about freedom and equal rights as those that&nbsp;Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant explored.&nbsp;Mendelssohn openly discussed the ways that Jews could live in a multi-religious society. &ldquo;Adopt the mores and constitution of the country in which you find yourself,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but be steadfast in upholding the religion of your fathers, too.&rdquo;*&nbsp;In subsequent generations, many Jews&mdash;among them, Karl Marx&rsquo;s parents&mdash;found it easier simply to convert to Christianity and live publicly as Christians in order to access jobs, property, and other basic rights.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Reform movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Isador Kaufmann, Man with Fur Hat, c. 1910, Vienna (The Jewish Museum, New York). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/47cb3f02e63fb844d162d5eb84bf5f935caddc99.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Isador Kaufmann, <em>Man with Fur Hat</em>, c. 1910, Vienna (The Jewish Museum, New York).&nbsp;&ldquo;Kaufmann&rsquo;s portraits of religiously devout Jews conveyed aspects of Jewish tradition that his audience of acculturated Jews and non-Jews would understand. Here, the sitters orthodoxy is indicated by his fur-trimmed shtraymel (hat) and black kapote (coat). Hung in well-appointed parlors....they...provided a connection to Jewish heritage by linking the world of cosmopolitan Vienna to a traditional lifestyle that endured outside the capital.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/man-with-fur-hat/ZAHnngZnzTGp6A?projectId=art-project\">Source</a></span></span>But there was another answer to the paradox posed by modernity.&nbsp;Inspired by Mendelssohn, Jewish questioners throughout German-speaking lands in the early nineteenth century developed the Reform movement.&nbsp;These reformers believed that their mission was to bring Judaism in line with modern thought; they also promoted the idea that prayers should be chanted in the local language rather than in Hebrew.&nbsp;They encouraged rabbis to look beyond the Talmud and Torah for guidance. Reformers spurned the idea that the past could dictate a way of life in an increasingly secular and&nbsp;industrial&nbsp;context.&nbsp;They modeled many of their religious practices after German Christians&nbsp;encouraging&nbsp;&ldquo;decorum&rdquo; in synagogue, introducing&nbsp;music similar to that heard in churches, and many even wanted to switch the Sabbath to Sunday. They wanted to remain Jews, while highlighting Judaism&rsquo;s similarities with Christianity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Orthodox movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These efforts infuriated traditionalists, who then reacted with steadfast conservatism.&nbsp; Some traditional rabbis had long opposed emancipation, but in response to the Reformers, a group of adherents to <em>Halakhah </em>codified the new Orthodox movement.&nbsp;They opposed many of the secular cultural forms that Judaism took in the coming decades: the Yiddishist movement, Zionism, and any other divergences from strict Halakhah. Some insisted that established customs not grounded in Jewish law should take on the weight of <em>Halakhah</em>&mdash;this is why some groups continue to dress and speak like their ancestors from a century ago or more.&nbsp; These extreme forms of observance are as much a product of modernity as Reform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Hasidic Judaism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Eastern Europe, another religious movement, called Hasidism, gained traction parallel to Reform and Orthodoxy.&nbsp;Founded in the eighteenth century by a rabbi and mystic who called himself Israel Baal Shem Tov, Hasidic Judaism grew out of a populist reaction to the elitism of the traditional Talmudic academy. Hasidic Judaism focuses on mystical interpretations of holy texts and the potential for uneducated Jews to experience holiness. The movement spread rapidly across Eastern and Central Europe. Hasidism&nbsp;gave rise to opposition from at least two sides: the traditional rabbinic legal structures that revolved around organized Torah study, and the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; Jews intent on both escaping the oppressive framework of the traditional Jewish family and acculturating into European society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In spite of Hasidic Judaism&rsquo;s strained history with what came to be known as Orthodoxy, it has become harder to distinguish stringent Orthodox Jews from their Hasidic counterparts. As Reform Judaism gained popularity, the two groups joined forces in support of Halakhah and in opposition to radical reform. Known for their distinctive dress (beards, fur hats, sidelocks, and caftans for men), Hasidim are among the most visible Jewish groups.</p>\n"

"<h3>Zionism</h3>\n"

"<p>Several events from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries proved that Jews were not welcomed as equals. In Russia, violent pogroms and economic instability pushed over two million people to emigrate&nbsp;in the 1880s. The vast majority fled to North America, and a small fraction of pioneers traveled to Palestine, the site of ancient Judaism&rsquo;s origins. Some Jewish leaders, responding to the growing nationalism and antisemitism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, followed Theodor Herzl&nbsp;who advocated for a type of&nbsp;secular Jewish nationalism, a return to the biblical homeland of the Jewish people.&nbsp;Religious Jews had prayed facing Jerusalem and called for a Messianic return to the Land of Israel since the Second Temple was destroyed. But the modern political movement, known as Zionism, united the religious impulse to &ldquo;return&rdquo; with&nbsp;secular ideas about constructing a European-style nation for Jews.&nbsp;It is important to note that Zionism was but one form of Jewish nationalism that took hold in the nineteenth century. Some Jews fought for territorial and political autonomy on different parts of the globe, others fought for cultural autonomy in the nations where they lived. These Diaspora nationalist movements mostly disappeared in 1948 when Israel became an&nbsp;independent state.</p>\n"

Ten thousand corpses lay unburied, and around 60,000 starving and sick people were packed into the camp&rsquo;s barracks without food or water. Doris Zinkeisen arrived soon afterwards. <em>Human Laundry</em> is arguably the most powerful work produced by any of the artists who were present&hellip;.The camp inmates needed to be washed and de-loused to prevent the spread of typhus before they could be admitted to the makeshift Red Cross hospital nearby.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/human-laundry-belsen-april-1945/cgFybCdTgEk9bQ?projectId=art-project\">Source</a></span></span></p>\n"

"<h3>Holocaust</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;The antisemite creates the Jew,&rdquo; wrote the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; Antisemitism had generated a false image of what a Jew is, making Jews seem like a social danger for the majority of Europeans. After World War I, liberal democracies everywhere appeared to be failing.&nbsp;The idea that Jews were responsible for social and economic crises convinced many&nbsp;to use race and ethnicity as a test to determine who&nbsp;belonged and who&nbsp;ought to be excluded.&nbsp;It was in this climate that the Nazi party was elected to power in 1933.&nbsp;Combining their expansionist vision with&nbsp;spurious theories of racial purity, the Germans quickly came to control most of central and eastern Europe.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Genocide became an everyday phenomenon&mdash;the Nuremburg Laws forced Jews to identify themselves with a badge, and criminalized sexual intimacy between Jews and gentiles. Laws were passed across Europe and the Mediterranean that excluded Jews from certain professions and the right to attend school.&nbsp;Citizenship was revoked and many people were&nbsp;forced&nbsp;from their homes into overcrowded wards.&nbsp;Inspired by the medieval ghetto, the Nazis went further&mdash;killing Jews by restricting food and medicine, packing thousands into spaces fit for far fewer, and, eventually, forbidding Jews to leave at all. Working in collaboration with governments across Europe, Nazi officials enacted a &ldquo;Final Solution&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Jewish Question&rdquo; in early 1942.&nbsp;Jews were forcibly&nbsp;gathered and shipped to local concentration camps and to death camps in Poland and Russia.&nbsp;Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.<br />\n"

While the sculpture may have&nbsp;seemed like a&nbsp;playful, if elaborate artistic joke,&nbsp;Claes Oldenburg&rsquo;s <em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks</em>&nbsp;was also deeply critical. Oldenburg made the 24-foot-high sculpture&nbsp;in collaboration with architecture students at his alma mater and then surreptitiously delivered it to Yale&rsquo;s Beinecke Plaza.&nbsp;In Beinecke Plaza, the sculpture overlooked both the office of Yale&rsquo;s president and a prominent World War I memorial. <em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks</em>&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;a visible space for the anti-war movement while also poking fun at the solemnity of the plaza. The sculpture served as a stage and backdrop for several subsequent student protests.</p>\n"

"(photo: <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/6kvUyi\">vige</a>, CC: BY 2.0)</span></span>Oldenburg and the architeciture students never intended for the original <em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks</em> sculpture to be permanent. They made the&nbsp;base of plywood, and the red vinyl tip of the lipstick could be comically inflated and deflated&mdash;although the balloon mechanism didn&rsquo;t always work. The original remained in Beinecke Plaza for ten&nbsp;months before Oldenburg removed it in order to remake the form in metal. The resulting sculpture was placed in&nbsp;a less-prominent spot on Yale&rsquo;s campus, where it remains to this day.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Gender, consumerism, and war</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Oldenburg had experimented with lipstick forms earlier in the 1960s, pasting catalog images of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lipstick onto postcards of London&rsquo;s Picadilly Circus. &nbsp; The resulting collages showed lipstick tubes looming like massive pillars over Picadilly&rsquo;s plaza. In the Yale sculpture, the artist combined the highly &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; product with the &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; machinery of war. In doing so, he playfully critiqued both the hawkish, hyper-masculine rhetoric of the military and the blatant consumerism of the United States.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to its feminine associations, the large lipstick tube is phallic and bullet-like, making the benign beauty product seem masculine or even violent. The juxtaposition implied that the U.S. obsession with beauty and consumption both fueled and distracted from the ongoing violence in Vietnam.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Going p</span><span>ublic</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Oldenburg had been designing large-scale, vinyl versions of household objects since his Green Gallery exhibition in 1962. He had created collages and drawings that played with the notion of massive domestic objects in public places, but <em>Lipstick</em> was his first large-scale public artwork. Oldenburg went on to make several other&nbsp;public sculptures that enlarged&nbsp;everyday domestic items to&nbsp;monumental dimensions.&nbsp;For example, he rendered a clothespin on the scale of an ancient Egyptian obelisk in a 1976 sculpture for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (below).<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Claes Oldenburg, Clothespin, 1976, cor-ten steel, 14 x 3.73 x 1.37 m, Centre Square, Philadelphia (photo: Ellen Fitzsimons, CC: BY-NC-SA)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d4c925f770ddf8ceb99e6d16d5cac31d8b315e04.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Claes Oldenburg, <em>Clothespin</em>, 1976, cor-ten steel, 14 x 3.73 x 1.37 m, Philadelphia<br />\n"
"(photo: <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/dnUKDP\">Ellen Fitzsimons</a>, CC: BY-NC-SA)</span></span>By bringing both domestic and military objects into a public space, <em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks</em> blurred the lines between public and private, and between the war in Vietnam and culture of the United States. In doing so, it upheld Oldenburg&rsquo;s 1961 declaration that &ldquo;I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum [&hellip;]&nbsp;I am for an art that imitates the human, that is comic, if necessary, or violent, or whatever is necessary [&hellip;].&rdquo;[1]</p>\n"

Oldenburg made the 24-foot-high sculpture&nbsp;in collaboration with architecture students at his alma mater and then surreptitiously delivered it to Yale&rsquo;s Beinecke Plaza.&nbsp;In Beinecke Plaza, the sculpture overlooked both the office of Yale&rsquo;s president and a prominent World War I memorial. <em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks</em>&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;a visible space for the anti-war movement while also poking fun at the solemnity of the plaza. The sculpture served as a stage and backdrop for several subsequent student protests.</p>\n"

"(photo: <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/6kvUyi\">vige</a>, CC: BY 2.0)</span></span>Oldenburg and the architeciture students never intended for the original <em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks</em> sculpture to be permanent. They made the&nbsp;base of plywood, and the red vinyl tip of the lipstick could be comically inflated and deflated&mdash;although the balloon mechanism didn&rsquo;t always work. The original remained in Beinecke Plaza for ten&nbsp;months before Oldenburg removed it in order to remake the form in metal. The resulting sculpture was placed in&nbsp;a less-prominent spot on Yale&rsquo;s campus, where it remains to this day.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Gender, consumerism, and war</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Oldenburg had experimented with lipstick forms earlier in the 1960s, pasting catalog images of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lipstick onto postcards of London&rsquo;s Picadilly Circus. &nbsp; The resulting collages showed lipstick tubes looming like massive pillars over Picadilly&rsquo;s plaza. In the Yale sculpture, the artist combined the highly &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; product with the &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; machinery of war. In doing so, he playfully critiqued both the hawkish, hyper-masculine rhetoric of the military and the blatant consumerism of the United States.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to its feminine associations, the large lipstick tube is phallic and bullet-like, making the benign beauty product seem masculine or even violent. The juxtaposition implied that the U.S. obsession with beauty and consumption both fueled and distracted from the ongoing violence in Vietnam.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Going p</span><span>ublic</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Oldenburg had been designing large-scale, vinyl versions of household objects since his Green Gallery exhibition in 1962. He had created collages and drawings that played with the notion of massive domestic objects in public places, but <em>Lipstick</em> was his first large-scale public artwork. Oldenburg went on to make several other&nbsp;public sculptures that enlarged&nbsp;everyday domestic items to&nbsp;monumental dimensions.&nbsp;For example, he rendered a clothespin on the scale of an ancient Egyptian obelisk in a 1976 sculpture for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (below).<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Claes Oldenburg, Clothespin, 1976, cor-ten steel, 14 x 3.73 x 1.37 m, Centre Square, Philadelphia (photo: Ellen Fitzsimons, CC: BY-NC-SA)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d4c925f770ddf8ceb99e6d16d5cac31d8b315e04.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Claes Oldenburg, <em>Clothespin</em>, 1976, cor-ten steel, 14 x 3.73 x 1.37 m, Philadelphia<br />\n"
"(photo: <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/dnUKDP\">Ellen Fitzsimons</a>, CC: BY-NC-SA)</span></span>By bringing both domestic and military objects into a public space, <em>Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks</em> blurred the lines between public and private, and between the war in Vietnam and culture of the United States. In doing so, it upheld Oldenburg&rsquo;s 1961 declaration that &ldquo;I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum [&hellip;]&nbsp;I am for an art that imitates the human, that is comic, if necessary, or violent, or whatever is necessary [&hellip;].&rdquo;[1]</p>\n"

"<h3>Vitally important, but difficult to interpret</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some artifacts are of such vital importance to our understanding of ancient cultures that they are truly unique and utterly irreplaceable. The gold mask of Tutankhamun was allowed to leave Egypt for display overseas; the <em>Narmer Palette</em>, on the other hand, is so valuable that it has never been permitted to leave the country.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Discovered among a group of sacred implements ritually buried in a deposit within an early temple of the falcon god Horus at the site of Hierakonpolis (the capital of Egypt during the pre-dynastic period), this large ceremonial object is one of the most important artifacts from the dawn of Egyptian civilization. The beautifully carved palette, 63.5 cm (more than 2 feet) in height and made of smooth greyish-green siltstone, is decorated on both faces with detailed low relief. These scenes show a king, identified by name as Narmer, and a series of ambiguous scenes that have been difficult to interpret and have resulted in a number of theories regarding their meaning.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The high quality of the workmanship, its original function as a ritual object dedicated to a god, and the complexity of the imagery clearly indicate that this was a significant object, but a satisfactory interpretation of the scenes has been elusive.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What was the palette used for?&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The object itself is a monumental version of a type of daily use item commonly found in the predynastic period&mdash;palettes were generally flat, minimally decorated stone objects used for grinding and mixing minerals for cosmetics. Dark eyeliner was an essential aspect of life in the sun-drenched region; like the dark streaks placed under the eyes of modern athletes, black cosmetic around the eyes served to reduce glare. Basic cosmetic palettes were among the typical grave goods found during this early era.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to these simple, purely functional, palettes however, there were also a number of larger, far more elaborate palettes created in this period. These objects still served the function of being a ground for grinding and mixing cosmetics, but they were also carefully carved with relief sculpture. Many of the earlier palettes display animals &mdash;some real, some fantastic&mdash;while later examples, like the Narmer palette, focus on human actions. Research suggests that these decorated palettes were used in temple ceremonies, perhaps to grind or mix makeup to be ritually applied to the image of the god. Later temple ritual included elaborate daily ceremonies involving the anointing and dressing of divine images; these palettes likely indicate an early incarnation of this process.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A ceremonial object, ritually buried&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The&nbsp;<em>Palette of Narmer</em>&nbsp;was discovered in 1898 by James Quibell and Frederick Green. It was found with a collection of other objects that had been used for ceremonial purposes and then ritually buried within the temple at Hierakonpolis.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Temple caches of this type are not uncommon. There was a great deal of focus on ritual and votive objects (offerings to the God) in temples. Every ruler, elite individual, and anyone else who could afford it, donated items to the temple to show their piety and increase their connection to the deity. After a period of time, the temple would be full of these objects and space would need to be cleared for new votive donations. However, since they had been dedicated to a temple and sanctified, the old items that needed to be cleared out could not simply be thrown away or sold. Instead, the general practice was to bury them in a pit under the temple floor. Often, these caches include objects from a range of dates and a mix of types, from royal statuary to furniture.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Conventions that remain the same for thousands of years</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are several reasons the&nbsp;<em>Narmer Palette</em>&nbsp;is considered to be of such importance. First, it is one of very few such palettes discovered in a controlled excavation. Second, there are a number of formal and iconographic characteristics appearing on the Narmer palette that remain conventional in Egyptian two-dimensional art for the following three millennia. These include the way the figures are represented, the scenes being organized in regular horizontal zones known as registers, and the use of hierarchical scale to indicate relative importance of the individuals. &nbsp;In addition, much of the regalia worn by the king, such as the crowns, kilts, royal beard, and bull tail, as well as other visual elements, such as the pose Narmer takes on one of the faces where he grasps an enemy by the hair and prepares to smash his skull with a mace, continue to be utilized from this time all the way through the Roman era. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagram of the Palette of Narmer\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/27bf72277f66037a77361248ad891229e17c12e3.jpeg\" /></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What we see on the palette</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The king is represented twice in human form, once on each face, followed by his sandal-bearer. He may also be represented as a powerful bull, destroying a walled city with his massive horns, in a mode that again becomes conventional&mdash;pharaoh is regularly referred to as &quot;Strong Bull.&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to the primary scenes, the palette includes a pair of fantastic creatures, known as serpopards&mdash;leopards with long, snaky necks&mdash;who are collared and controlled by a pair of attendants. Their necks entwine and define the recess where the makeup preparation took place. The lowest register on both sides include images of dead foes, while both uppermost registers display hybrid human-bull heads and the name of the king. The frontal bull heads are likely connected to a sky goddess known as Bat and are related to heaven and the horizon. The name of the king, written hieroglyphically as a catfish and a chisel, is contained within a squared element that represents a palace facade.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Possible interpretation: unification of Upper and Lower Egypt</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As mentioned above, there have been a number of theories related to the scenes carved on this palette. Some have interpreted the battle scenes as a historical narrative record of the initial unification of Egypt under one ruler, supported by the general timing (as this is the period of the unification) and the fact that Narmer sports the crown connected to Upper Egypt on one face of the palette and the crown of Lower Egypt on the other&mdash;this is the first preserved example where both crowns are used by the same ruler. Other theories suggest that, rather than an actual historical representation, these scenes were purely ceremonial and related to the concept of unification in general.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Another interpretation: the sun and the king</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More recent research on the decorative program has connected the imagery to the careful balance of order and chaos (known as ma&rsquo;at and isfet) that was a fundamental element of the Egyptian idea of the cosmos. It may also be related to the daily journey of the sun god that becomes a central aspect in the Egyptian religion in the subsequent centuries.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The scene showing Narmer wearing the Lower Egyptian Red Crown (with its distinctive curl)* depicts him processing towards the decapitated bodies of his foes. The two rows of prone bodies are placed below an image of a high-prowed boat preparing to pass through an open gate. This may be an early reference to the journey of the sun god in his boat. In later texts, the Red Crown is connected with bloody battles fought by the sun god just before the rosy-fingered dawn on his daily journey and this scene may well be related to this. It is interesting to note that the foes are shown as not only executed, but rendered completely impotent&mdash;their castrated penises have been placed atop their severed heads.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On the other face, Narmer wears the Upper Egyptian White Crown* (which looks rather like a bowling pin) as he grasps an inert foe by the hair and prepares to crush his skull. The White Crown is related to the dazzling brilliance of the full midday sun at its zenith as well as the luminous nocturnal light of the stars and moon. By wearing both crowns, Narmer may not only be ceremonially expressing his dominance over the unified Egypt, but also the early importance of the solar cycle and the king&rsquo;s role in this daily process.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This fascinating object is an incredible example of early Egyptian art. The imagery preserved on this palette provides a peek ahead to the richness of both the visual aspects and religious concepts that develop in the ensuing periods. It is a vitally important artifact of extreme significance for our understanding of the development of Egyptian culture on multiple levels.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>*The Red Crown of Lower Egypt and the White Crown of Upper Egypt were the earliest crowns worn by the king and are closely connected with the unification of the country that sparks full-blown Egyptian civilization. The earliest representation of them worn by the same ruler is on the&nbsp;<em>Narmer Palette</em>, signifying that the king was ruling over both areas of the country. Soon after the unification, the fifth ruler of the First Dynasty is shown wearing the two crowns simultaneously, combined into one. This crown, often referred to as the Double Crown, remains a primary crown worn by pharaoh throughout Egyptian history. The separate Red and White crowns, however, continue to be worn as well and retain their geographic connections. There are a number of Egyptian words used for these crowns (nine for the White and 11 for the Red), but the most common&mdash;deshret and hedjet&mdash;refer to the colors red and white, respectively. It is from these identifying terms that we take their modern name. Early texts make it clear that these crowns were believed to be imbued with divine power and were personified as goddesses.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Palette of Narmer (detail) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3a46d2ecb5c76754d86914abbf9ca13afbee64e8.jpeg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Palette of Narmer (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The scene showing Narmer wearing the Lower Egyptian Red Crown (with its distinctive curl)* depicts him processing towards the decapitated bodies of his foes. The two rows of prone bodies are placed below an image of a high-prowed boat preparing to pass through an open gate. This may be an early reference to the journey of the sun god in his boat. In later texts, the Red Crown is connected with bloody battles fought by the sun god just before the rosy-fingered dawn on his daily journey and this scene may well be related to this. It is interesting to note that the foes are shown as not only executed, but rendered completely impotent&mdash;their castrated penises have been placed atop their severed heads.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On the other face, Narmer wears the Upper Egyptian White Crown* (which looks rather like a bowling pin) as he grasps an inert foe by the hair and prepares to crush his skull. The White Crown is related to the dazzling brilliance of the full midday sun at its zenith as well as the luminous nocturnal light of the stars and moon. By wearing both crowns, Narmer may not only be ceremonially expressing his dominance over the unified Egypt, but also the early importance of the solar cycle and the king&rsquo;s role in this daily process.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This fascinating object is an incredible example of early Egyptian art. The imagery preserved on this palette provides a peek ahead to the richness of both the visual aspects and religious concepts that develop in the ensuing periods. It is a vitally important artifact of extreme significance for our understanding of the development of Egyptian culture on multiple levels.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>*The Red Crown of Lower Egypt and the White Crown of Upper Egypt were the earliest crowns worn by the king and are closely connected with the unification of the country that sparks full-blown Egyptian civilization. The earliest representation of them worn by the same ruler is on the&nbsp;<em>Narmer Palette</em>, signifying that the king was ruling over both areas of the country. Soon after the unification, the fifth ruler of the First Dynasty is shown wearing the two crowns simultaneously, combined into one. This crown, often referred to as the Double Crown, remains a primary crown worn by pharaoh throughout Egyptian history. The separate Red and White crowns, however, continue to be worn as well and retain their geographic connections. There are a number of Egyptian words used for these crowns (nine for the White and 11 for the Red), but the most common&mdash;deshret and hedjet&mdash;refer to the colors red and white, respectively. It is from these identifying terms that we take their modern name. Early texts make it clear that these crowns were believed to be imbued with divine power and were personified as goddesses.</p>\n"

"<h3>The subject of the Flagellation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s <em>Flagellation of Christ</em> is proof that, sometimes, good things really do come in small packages. Despite the panel&rsquo;s size (only 58.4&nbsp;cm &times;&nbsp;81.5&nbsp;cm), the painting has been a mainstay in the last century in discussions of Quattrocento (fifteenth century) painting. An early example of the use of oil paint&mdash;though Piero used both tempera and oil in its execution&mdash;the work depicts the moment in Christ&rsquo;s Passion when he was whipped before Pontius Pilate. Though the New Testament says very little about this moment, mentioning only that Pilate ordered Christ to be flogged, later Christian writers wrote much about the event, and even speculated about the number of lashes Christ received. Though the New Testament does not say that Christ was tied to a column while being whipped, during the fifteenth century this became a convention in depictions of the scene, which Piero here follows. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A masterpiece of the Early Renaissance</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This painting is a masterpiece of the early Renaissance. The figures are expressive; especially noteworthy is the face of the bearded man in the foreground. They are also given real volume through the use of modeling (the passage from light to dark over the surface of an object). True to Humanism, the painting shows a preoccupation with the Classical world, as seen especially in the architecture and inclusion of the golden statue in the background. Above all, Piero&rsquo;s obsession with perspective (the naturalistic recession in to space), is evident. In fact, the artist was the author of a treatise on perspective, entitled <em>De Perspectiva Pingendi</em> (<em>On the Perspective of Painting</em>) and was also known as a mathematician and geometer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Who are the men in the foreground?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s picture is also highly unusual. The flagellation, which is the gruesome main event, takes place in the background, while three extraneous men are painted prominently in the foreground. Piero uses two main devices to further emphasize the division of subjects. The first is setting. While the flagellation takes place inside of a covered courtyard with dramatic black and white checked tiles, the men are outdoors standing on the reddish tiles that pervade the scene. The second is the use of the orthogonal lines of the perspective, which divide the painting in half, and also delineate the interior and exterior space.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Not only is the painting strange because Piero marginalized the primary subject, relegating it to the back of the painting, but also because art historians cannot agree on who the three men in the foreground are. Theories abound. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The traditional identification of these three men is that the young man in the center is Oddantanio da Montefeltro, ruler of Urbino, flanked on either side by his advisors. &nbsp;All three of these men were killed in a conspiracy. In this case, it is suggested that the patron of the painting was Federigo da Montefeltro (who was later immortalized in a famous diptych by Piero) to commemorate his brother&rsquo;s death and compare his innocence to that of Christ. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historian Marilyn Lavin offered another notable interpretation of the painting. She suggested that the two older men are Ludovico Gonzaga and a friend, who had both recently lost their sons, symbolized by the young man in the center. The painting in this case would compare the pain that the two fathers felt to that of Christ during his Passion. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other art historians have suggested that the painting is an allegory for the suffering of Constantinople after its fall to the Muslims in 1453. In this view, the two men watching the flagellation are Murad II (the Islamic sultan who waged a decades-long war against Christianity), and Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (against whom that war was waged). The emperor had gone to the 1438 Council of Florence to ask for protection from the Muslims, but received no aid. The three enigmatic men, then, represent nobles who stood by and let the Christian nation be destroyed. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The enigmatic nature of Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s <em>Flagellation</em> underscores the fact that works of art, regardless of their age, continue to engender interesting art historical research. In the case of this painting, it is unlikely that a definitive interpretation will ever be accepted, as there is little documentation to support a single argument. Perhaps this ambiguity is partially why the painting continues to intrigue, and, almost 600 years later, grants multiple entry points to the viewer, drawing him into Piero&rsquo;s fictional world.</p>\n"

"<h3>A reference to the sun</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The shape of the pyramid was a solar reference, perhaps intended as a solidified version of the rays of the sun. Texts talk about the sun&rsquo;s rays as a ramp the pharaoh mounts to climb to the sky&mdash;the earliest pyramids, such as the Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara&mdash;were actually designed as a staircase. The pyramid was also clearly connected to the sacred ben-ben stone, an icon of the primeval mound that was considered the place of initial creation. The pyramid was considered a place of regeneration for the deceased ruler.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Construction</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Many questions remain about the construction of these massive monuments, and theories abound as to the actual methods used. The workforce needed to build these structures is also still much discussed. Discovery of a town for workers to the south of the plateau has offered some answers. It is likely that there was a permanent group of skilled craftsmen and builders who were supplemented by seasonal crews of approximately 2,000 conscripted peasants. These crews were divided into gangs of 200 men, with each group further divided into teams of 20. Experiments indicate that these groups of 20 men could haul the 2.5 ton blocks from quarry to pyramid in about 20 minutes, their path eased by a lubricated surface of wet silt. An estimated 340 stones could be moved daily from quarry to construction site, particularly when one considers that many of the blocks (such as those in the upper courses) were considerably smaller.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>A reference to the sun</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The shape of the pyramid was a solar reference, perhaps intended as a solidified version of the rays of the sun. Texts talk about the sun&rsquo;s rays as a ramp the pharaoh mounts to climb to the sky&mdash;the earliest pyramids, such as the Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara&mdash;were actually designed as a staircase. The pyramid was also clearly connected to the sacred ben-ben stone, an icon of the primeval mound that was considered the place of initial creation. The pyramid was considered a place of regeneration for the deceased ruler.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Construction</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Many questions remain about the construction of these massive monuments, and theories abound as to the actual methods used. The workforce needed to build these structures is also still much discussed. Discovery of a town for workers to the south of the plateau has offered some answers. It is likely that there was a permanent group of skilled craftsmen and builders who were supplemented by seasonal crews of approximately 2,000 conscripted peasants. These crews were divided into gangs of 200 men, with each group further divided into teams of 20. Experiments indicate that these groups of 20 men could haul the 2.5 ton blocks from quarry to pyramid in about 20 minutes, their path eased by a lubricated surface of wet silt. An estimated 340 stones could be moved daily from quarry to construction site, particularly when one considers that many of the blocks (such as those in the upper courses) were considerably smaller.</span></p>\n"

"<p>Qin Shihuang (259-210 B.C.E.) conquered much in this life, but his driving purpose was even greater;&nbsp;he sought to conquer death.&nbsp;In order to achieve immortality, he built himself a tomb&mdash;a vast underground city guarded by a life-size terracotta army including warriors, infantrymen, horses, chariots and all their attendant armor and weaponry.</p>\n"

"<p>The underground terracotta army found in the First Emperor&rsquo;s burial complex is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable and mysterious discoveries from the ancient world.&nbsp;A sprawling citadel has been unearthed, complete with gardens and stables, bronze ritual vessels, jade jewelry, and a wealth of gold and silver ornaments.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Besides revealing much about an ancient way of life, observing the physical construction of the underground complex and the methodical production of the figures reveals a set of themes from which we gain a window of insight to the First Emperor&rsquo;s worldview and enduring influence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Innovation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The First Emperor<span>&nbsp;known for stunning innovations that consolidated his rule through modernization. During his reign, he introduced the standardization of currency, writing, measurements and more. He connected cities and states with advanced systems of roads and canals. He is also credited with continuing the construction of the Great Wall, which is perhaps the most widely-known symbol still associated with China to this day.</span><br />\n"

We also see&nbsp;the first assembly-line style production in the creation of his terracotta warriors, horses and chariots.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Immortality</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the burial complex is what it suggests about the young Emperor&rsquo;s obsession with immortality.&nbsp;Driven to conquer death itself, the eventual First Emperor ascended to the throne of the Qin state at age of 13 and immediately began to plan his burial, and more importantly, his underground palace, a mausoleum attended by&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>According to Han-dynasty historian Sima Qian, the First Emperor lined his burial complex with a treasury of riches and piles of precious gemstones said to represent the stars, sun and moon. He was deeply concerned with the universe and looked to the cosmos as a guide for crossing over to an immortal existence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Excavation also revealed other mysterious findings, like strangely high levels of mercury and evidence that the poisonous substance coursed through an intricate system of underground troughs, replicating the topography of the actual rivers and seas carving the surrounding landscape. Some suggest that the emperor believed mercury had life-giving power and so surrounded himself with the toxic element, believing it was yet another way he might live forever.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Unification</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of all the accomplishments from this extraordinary period, the unification of China is, without question, the greatest symbol of the Qin dynasty&rsquo;s power and influence.&nbsp;Born in a time of turmoil in China&#39;s history, known as the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.E.), The First Emperor founded the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 B.C.E.). By 221 B.C.E., he merged the seven warring states into one nation and took the name Qin Shihuang, which means First Emperor. He left a legacy of a centralized and bureaucratic state that would be carried onto successive dynasties over the next two millennia.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>The First Emperor</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Qin Shihuang (259-210 B.C.E.) conquered much in this life, but his driving purpose was even greater;&nbsp;he sought to conquer death.&nbsp;In order to achieve immortality, he built himself a tomb&mdash;a vast underground city guarded by a life-size terracotta army including warriors, infantrymen, horses, chariots and all their attendant armor and weaponry.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The underground terracotta army found in the First Emperor&rsquo;s burial complex is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable and mysterious discoveries from the ancient world.&nbsp;A sprawling citadel has been unearthed, complete with gardens and stables, bronze ritual vessels, jade jewelry, and a wealth of gold and silver ornaments.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Besides revealing much about an ancient way of life, observing the physical construction of the underground complex and the methodical production of the figures reveals a set of themes from which we gain a window of insight to the First Emperor&rsquo;s worldview and enduring influence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Innovation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The First Emperor<span>&nbsp;known for stunning innovations that consolidated his rule through modernization. During his reign, he introduced the standardization of currency, writing, measurements and more. He connected cities and states with advanced systems of roads and canals. He is also credited with continuing the construction of the Great Wall, which is perhaps the most widely-known symbol still associated with China to this day.</span><br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>He is regarded as a military genius, and while his methods included massacre and destruction, some claim that his ultimate success at bringing the states together justifies the violence, a necessary cost of nation-building. We also see&nbsp;the first assembly-line style production in the creation of his terracotta warriors, horses and chariots.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Immortality</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the burial complex is what it suggests about the young Emperor&rsquo;s obsession with immortality.&nbsp;Driven to conquer death itself, the eventual First Emperor ascended to the throne of the Qin state at age of 13 and immediately began to plan his burial, and more importantly, his underground palace, a mausoleum attended by&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2c4d8eb2cb887feb626874cfa6306d928bd26dd4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Terracotta warriors from the mausoleum of the first Qin emperor of China Qin Shihuang, c. 221-206 B.C.E., Qin Dynasty, painted terracotta, Terracotta Warriors and Horses Museum, Shaanxi, China (photo: <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/8bByLC\">NekaPearl</a>, CC: BY-NC 2.0)</span></span>an army including over 7,000 terracotta warriors horses, chariots and weaponry intended to protect him in the afterlife.&nbsp;The First Emperor envisioned a subterranean domain that would parallel his worldly existence after corporal death.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>According to Han-dynasty historian Sima Qian, the First Emperor lined his burial complex with a treasury of riches and piles of precious gemstones said to represent the stars, sun and moon. He was deeply concerned with the universe and looked to the cosmos as a guide for crossing over to an immortal existence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Excavation also revealed other mysterious findings, like strangely high levels of mercury and evidence that the poisonous substance coursed through an intricate system of underground troughs, replicating the topography of the actual rivers and seas carving the surrounding landscape. Some suggest that the emperor believed mercury had life-giving power and so surrounded himself with the toxic element, believing it was yet another way he might live forever.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Unification</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of all the accomplishments from this extraordinary period, the unification of China is, without question, the greatest symbol of the Qin dynasty&rsquo;s power and influence.&nbsp;Born in a time of turmoil in China&#39;s history, known as the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.E.), The First Emperor founded the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 B.C.E.). By 221 B.C.E., he merged the seven warring states into one nation and took the name Qin Shihuang, which means First Emperor. He left a legacy of a centralized and bureaucratic state that would be carried onto successive dynasties over the next two millennia.</p>\n"

"<h3>Boom times in Florence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The city-state of Florence in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries was a city on the rise. Urbanization was experienced by all Italian cities at this time and Florence&rsquo;s population doubled in size. But more than almost any other town, Florence saw an explosion in international trade and innovations in finance. A new class of bankers and merchants replaced the old noble families as the center of power, developing a complex, barely democratic social structure that hung in a careful balance.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"View of Palazzo della Signoria, 1299-1310, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ed62d6c1d186e237b36c66eb2f3d38bda01ce547.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">View of Palazzo della Signoria, 1299-1310, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art and architecture helped define the relationships between individuals and the bewildering array of civic, professional, and religious institutions that made up the fabric of Florentine society. Thanks to the city&rsquo;s newfound wealth, impressive communal building projects were undertaken, like the building of a new seat of government, the Palazzo della Signoria.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Church and state&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During this building boom, church and state were anything but separate. Public funds were used to erect many of the religious centers, including the cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. Subsidies were even given over to the large new churches needed to accommodate growing audiences for the sermons of the mendicant orders (monks that had forsaken worldly possessions and that lived and preached in the cities). The largest of these mendicant behemoths were the Franciscan church of Santa Croce and the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Guilds and private patrons too&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Happily, the decoration of buildings throughout the city fell to a widening range of patrons. Professional guilds (somewhat like our trade unions) were often in charge of decorating public spaces with painting and, increasingly, architectural sculpture. Groups of priests, nuns, and confraternities (organizations of laypeople that gathered to perform acts of charity or sing hymns) hired artists to create devotional images and lavish books of hymns. For the first time, wealthy individuals and families could even purchase the rights to use and decorate chapels within a church.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A more personal spirituality</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But art was not all about public displays of wealth or works of communal beautification. Faith and spirituality became more deeply personal even as they became more public. More than in previous centuries, images played an important role in focusing a person&rsquo;s devotion to Christ, Mary and the saints&mdash;in imagining their lives or picturing how they might appear in all their heavenly glory. In fact, images didn&rsquo;t just maintain relationships within Florentine society, they built imagined relationships between viewers and the sacred figures they portrayed. This affected more than just the amount of art people needed; it affected what they wanted it to look like. And in the course of the fourteenth century, what they wanted it to look like would change dramatically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Italo-Byzantine style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Coppo di Marcovaldo and his son Salerno, Crucifixion, 1274 (Pistoia Cathedral)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d47dafe9fd25ad5ca42d1bf43040ea05c76af576.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coppo di Marcovaldo and his son Salerno, <em>Crucifixion</em>, 1274 (Pistoia Cathedral)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like the art of most Italian cities at the time, thirteenth-century art in Florence was heavily influenced by Byzantine art (the art of the Byzantine Empire). Images from this period are in fact often described as &ldquo;Italo-Byzantine,&rdquo; a label that reflects how artists such as Coppo di Marcovaldo (and many more artists whose names we don&rsquo;t know) adapted the foreign style into something altogether Italian.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In painting, this meant emulating the way figures were strongly outlined against glittering gold backgrounds like those seen in Byzantine icons and mosaics. These ornate images seem to directly engage the viewer by pressing whatever is being depicted by the artist to the surface of the painting or mosaic. Figures are formed out of abstract but expressive shapes designed to identify various body parts or items of clothing while creating beautiful patterns. In narrative images, each story plays out across the field of representation instead of within it, eliminating the need for a sense of depth.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Cimabue, Santa Trinita Madonna (Madonna and Child Enthroned), 1280-90 tempera on panel (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/337136f84864b1990f529261ce815399bcae209e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Cimabue,<em> Santa Trinita Madonna (Madonna and Child Enthroned)</em>, 1280-90 tempera on panel (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>A new style emerges&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the late thirteenth century, artists in a handful of Italian cities began to move away from the Italo-Byzantine style. The Roman artist Pietro Cavallini created frescoes and mosaics featuring solid, monumentalizing figures; the sculptor Nicola Pisano studied ancient Roman sculpture; Sienese artists seem to have broken new ground in exploring perspective. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, back in Florence, Cimabue&rsquo;s paintings showed more interest in depicting space and modeling figures with gradations of light and shade. These ideas spread as artists travelled throughout Italy and southern France in search of work, creating a network of artistic centers that all exerted influence on one another.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Giotto di Bondone, The Ognissanti Madonna, 1306-10, tempera on panel, 128 x 80 1/4&quot; or 325 x 204 cm (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9afde9efa4109d1a56e7e6e00e5ae316d10c76a9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Giotto di Bondone, <em>The Ognissanti Madonna</em>, 1306-10, tempera on panel, 128 x 80 1/4&quot; or 325 x 204 cm (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence)</span></span>Giotto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As the new century opened, the painter Giotto di Bondone observed many of these currents and forged them into something distinctively Florentine and enormously influential.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where earlier works of art engage us with the embellished splendor of the heavenly, Giotto&rsquo;s paintings capture our attention by representing holy figures and stories as if in a majestic but earthly realm. Bold modeling of draperies and the bodies beneath them gives his figures greater volume and a sense of sculptural relief. Clever kinds of perspective create the illusion that a space is opening up in front of the viewer, as if we might be peering onto a stage.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Perhaps just as importantly, Giotto was a master of visual storytelling &ndash; a skill evident in his most important surviving project, the frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua (c. 1305). Here the monumentality of the figures, the quiet dignity of their movements, and the way architectural and landscape settings seem to echo the action all conjure up a solemn aura of the sacred. Like many of the narrative paintings attributed to Giotto, the scenes use closely observed human gestures and careful composition to enhance the drama and emotion of the moment depicted.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Art after Giotto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Giotto had an enormous workshop full of students and assistants, making it hard to tell which works he painted and which were by his pupils. Even more confusingly, his style was so immediately influential that it is still difficult to say who his formal students were. What we do know is that, in the years immediately after his death, the artists who were the most &ldquo;Giottesque&rdquo; received the lion&rsquo;s share of the important commissions for new projects. The success of artists like Bernardo Daddi, Maso di Banco, and Taddeo Gaddi demonstrates that wealthy patrons were on board with Giotto&rsquo;s new vision for art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sometime around mid-century, though, certain artists began to drift from the clear, spare art of Giotto&rsquo;s school. Many experimented with visually crowded compositions or with complex subjects represented through elaborate symbols and schemes. Some even seem to have purposefully echoed the ornamental, formal art of the Italo-Byzantine period. This has led art historians to wonder whether these changes in style were caused by Florence&rsquo;s collective despair after the outbreak of the bubonic plague&mdash;a sickness that wiped out over half the city&rsquo;s population in one year alone (1348).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e0bdde432f8605b350f3356d14877e7943773d81.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most scholars now think the situation was more mixed than this theory might lead us to believe. In fact, late fourteenth-century art is hard to generalize. This is partly because no single workshop dominated the art of Florence as much as Giotto and his school had in previous decades. But it is also because artists of the time were skilled at adapting their own style to the specific tastes of each patron and to the context and function of each image.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Overall, however, Florentine art from 1348 to 1400 did not experience the same kind of major stylistic shift that characterized Giotto&rsquo;s years on the scene. Rather, the fundamental influence of Giotto continued into the early 1400s. In the end, the long fourteenth-century was Giotto&rsquo;s century.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Like the art of most Italian cities at the time, thirteenth-century art in Florence was heavily influenced by Byzantine art (the art of the Byzantine Empire). Images from this period are in fact often described as &ldquo;Italo-Byzantine,&rdquo; a label that reflects how artists such as Coppo di Marcovaldo (and many more artists whose names we don&rsquo;t know) adapted the foreign style into something altogether Italian.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In painting, this meant emulating the way figures were strongly outlined against glittering gold backgrounds like those seen in Byzantine icons and mosaics. These ornate images seem to directly engage the viewer by pressing whatever is being depicted by the artist to the surface of the painting or mosaic. Figures are formed out of abstract but expressive shapes designed to identify various body parts or items of clothing while creating beautiful patterns. In narrative images, each story plays out across the field of representation instead of within it, eliminating the need for a sense of depth.</p>\n"

"<h3><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Cimabue, Santa Trinita Madonna (Madonna and Child Enthroned), 1280-90 tempera on panel (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/337136f84864b1990f529261ce815399bcae209e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Cimabue,<em> Santa Trinita Madonna (Madonna and Child Enthroned)</em>, 1280-90 tempera on panel (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>A new style emerges&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the late thirteenth century, artists in a handful of Italian cities began to move away from the Italo-Byzantine style. The Roman artist Pietro Cavallini created frescoes and mosaics featuring solid, monumentalizing figures; the sculptor Nicola Pisano studied ancient Roman sculpture; Sienese artists seem to have broken new ground in exploring perspective. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, back in Florence, Cimabue&rsquo;s paintings showed more interest in depicting space and modeling figures with gradations of light and shade. These ideas spread as artists travelled throughout Italy and southern France in search of work, creating a network of artistic centers that all exerted influence on one another.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>As the new century opened, the painter Giotto di Bondone observed many of these currents and forged them into something distinctively Florentine and enormously influential.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where earlier works of art engage us with the embellished splendor of the heavenly, Giotto&rsquo;s paintings capture our attention by representing holy figures and stories as if in a majestic but earthly realm. Bold modeling of draperies and the bodies beneath them gives his figures greater volume and a sense of sculptural relief. Clever kinds of perspective create the illusion that a space is opening up in front of the viewer, as if we might be peering onto a stage.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Perhaps just as importantly, Giotto was a master of visual storytelling &ndash; a skill evident in his most important surviving project, the frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua (c. 1305). Here the monumentality of the figures, the quiet dignity of their movements, and the way architectural and landscape settings seem to echo the action all conjure up a solemn aura of the sacred. Like many of the narrative paintings attributed to Giotto, the scenes use closely observed human gestures and careful composition to enhance the drama and emotion of the moment depicted.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Art after Giotto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Giotto had an enormous workshop full of students and assistants, making it hard to tell which works he painted and which were by his pupils. Even more confusingly, his style was so immediately influential that it is still difficult to say who his formal students were. What we do know is that, in the years immediately after his death, the artists who were the most &ldquo;Giottesque&rdquo; received the lion&rsquo;s share of the important commissions for new projects. The success of artists like Bernardo Daddi, Maso di Banco, and Taddeo Gaddi demonstrates that wealthy patrons were on board with Giotto&rsquo;s new vision for art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sometime around mid-century, though, certain artists began to drift from the clear, spare art of Giotto&rsquo;s school. Many experimented with visually crowded compositions or with complex subjects represented through elaborate symbols and schemes. Some even seem to have purposefully echoed the ornamental, formal art of the Italo-Byzantine period. This has led art historians to wonder whether these changes in style were caused by Florence&rsquo;s collective despair after the outbreak of the bubonic plague&mdash;a sickness that wiped out over half the city&rsquo;s population in one year alone (1348).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e0bdde432f8605b350f3356d14877e7943773d81.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most scholars now think the situation was more mixed than this theory might lead us to believe. In fact, late fourteenth-century art is hard to generalize. This is partly because no single workshop dominated the art of Florence as much as Giotto and his school had in previous decades. But it is also because artists of the time were skilled at adapting their own style to the specific tastes of each patron and to the context and function of each image.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Overall, however, Florentine art from 1348 to 1400 did not experience the same kind of major stylistic shift that characterized Giotto&rsquo;s years on the scene. Rather, the fundamental influence of Giotto continued into the early 1400s. In the end, the long fourteenth-century was Giotto&rsquo;s century.</p>\n"

"<p>The Maori built meeting houses&nbsp;before the period of contact with Europeans. The early structures appear to have been used as the homes of chiefs, though they were also used for accommodating guests. They did not exist in every community.

The open space in front of the house, known as a&nbsp;<em>marae</em>, is used as an assembly ground.&nbsp;They were, and still are, used for entertaining, for funerals, religious and political meetings.&nbsp;It is a focus of tribal pride and is treated with great respect.<br />\n"

"<p>The Maori meeting house increased in size and height during the nineteenth century, due partly to European influence. Consequently <em>poutokomanawa</em> figures increased in size until the largest were around two meters high.</p>\n"

"<p>The style of carving - the solidly proportioned body and large hands&mdash;is typical of the prominent Ngati Kahungunu school of carvers from the central Hawkes Bay district, in the mid-nineteenth century.

If you were lucky enough to be invited to a dinner party at the emperor&rsquo;s palace, he might display his gem collection or show off his large imperial cameos.

"<p>Cameos were a popular medium in the private art of the Roman Empire. While cameos first appeared in the Hellenistic period, they became most fashionable under the Romans. Typically cameos were made of a brown stone that had bands or layers of white throughout, such as sardonyx. This layered stone was then carved in such a way that the figures stood out in white relief while the background remained the dark part of the stone. Most cameos were small and functioned as pendants or rings. But there are a few examples of much larger cameos that were specifically commissioned by the emperor and members of his imperial circle, the most famous example is the Gemma Augustea.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Gemma Augustea</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Gemma Augustea is divided into two registers that are crammed with figures and iconography. The upper register contains three historical figures and a host of deities and personifications. Our eyes immediately gravitate towards the center of the upper register and the two large enthroned figures, Roma (the personification of the city of Rome) and the emperor Augustus. Roma is surrounded by military paraphernalia while Augustus holds a scepter, a symbol of his right to rule and his role as the leader of the Roman Empire. At his feet is an eagle, a symbol of the god Jupiter and so we quickly realize that Augustus has close ties to the gods. Augustus is depicted as a heroic semi-nude, a convention usually reserved for deities. Augustus is not only stating that he has connections to gods, he is stating that he is also god-like.</p>\n"

"<p>Two other historical figures accompany Augustus in the upper register. At the far left is Tiberius, who will eventually succeed Augustus on the throne. To the right of Tiberius is the young Germanicus, another member of Augustus&rsquo; family and a potential heir to the throne.

"<p>Interspersed amongst the three historical figures of the upper register are deities and personifications. Directly behind Tiberius is winged Victory. Behind Augustus is Oikoumene, the personification of the civilized world, who places a corona civica (civic crown) on the emperor&rsquo;s head. In the Roman Empire, it was a great honor to be awarded the civic crown as it was only given to someone who had saved Roman citizens from an enemy (and Augustus had certainly done just that by rescuing Romans from civil war). Oceanus, the personification of the oceans, sits on the far right. Finally, Tellus Italiae, the mother earth goddess and personification of Italy, sits with her two chubby children and holds a cornucopia.</p>\n"

"<p>What does the top register mean, with its grouping of mortals, deities, and personifications? In short, everything praises Augustus. The emperor expresses his domination throughout the Roman Empire and his greatest accomplishment, the pacification of the Roman world, which resulted in fertility and prosperity. Augustus&rsquo; peace and dominion will spread not only throughout the city of Rome (represented by the goddess Roma), but also to all of Italy (represented by Tellus Italiae) and throughout the entire civilized world (symbolized by Oikoumene).

His summary reminds us that in the city of Rome the Forum Romanum was the key political, ritual, and civic center. Located in a valley separating the Capitoline and Palatine Hills, the Forum developed from the earliest times and remained in use after the city&rsquo;s eventual decline; during that span of time the forum witnessed the growth and eventual contraction of the city and her empire.&nbsp;The archaeological remains of the Forum Romanum&nbsp;itself continue to provide important insights into the phases and processes associated with urbanism and monumentality in ancient Rome.</p>\n"

"<p>The traditional foundation narrative holds that one of the first acts of Romulus, the city&rsquo;s eponymous founder, was to establish a fortification wall around the Palatine Hill, the site of his new settlement. The Capitoline Hill, opposite the Palatine, emerged as the city&rsquo;s citadel (<em>arx</em>) and site of the poliadic cult of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, among others (poliadic:&nbsp;the chief civic cult of an ancient city, derived from the Greek word &quot;polis&quot;).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Iron Age populations had used the marshy valley separating the Palatine and Capitoline hills as a necropolis (a large ancient cemetery), but the burgeoning settlement of archaic Rome had need of communal space and the valley was repurposed from a necropolis to a usable space. This required several transformations, both of human activity and the natural environment.

Since the Tiber river tended to leave its banks regularly, the valley was prone to significant flooding, as a low saddle of land known as the Velabrum connects the forum valley to the riverine zone. As coring studies conducted&nbsp;by Albert J. Ammerman have shown, a deliberate landfill project deposited fill in the forum valley in order to create usable, dry levels during the sixth century B.C.E. Twentieth century excavators, including Giacomo Boni and Einar Gjerstad, revealed important remains of Iron Age burials that pre-dated the establishment of the forum valley as a civic space; in particular the necropolis in the area known as the <em>Sepulcretum</em> along the Sacra Via (&quot;Sacred Way,&quot; the&nbsp;main sacred processional road of the city)&nbsp;has been extensively studied and published.&nbsp;The investigations of the burials themselves, and the patterns they followed, have allowed archaeologists to understand not only funeral customs but also social dynamics during Rome&rsquo;s proto-urban phases.<br />\n"

"<p>This major investment in the creation of civic space and the organization of labor also provides important information about the socio-economic structure of early Rome (Livy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi0011.perseus-eng3\">1.59.9</a>). The drainage canal eventually came to have a vaulted covering and was known as the <em>Cloaca Maxima</em> or &quot;Great Drain.&quot;&nbsp;One of the clear outcomes of these civic investments was the creation of a usable space that came to be a civic focus for activities in many spheres, especially political and sacred functions.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Temples and sacred buildings</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the Early Republican period the forum space saw the construction of key temples. One of the most prominent early temples is the Temple of Saturn (often considered the earliest of the temples in the Forum Romanum), the first iteration of which dates c. 498 B.C.E. The temple was dedicated to Saturn, the god of agriculture, and housed the state treasury. The temple was rebuilt in 42 B.C.E. and again after 283 C.E. Another early Republican temple is the Temple of the Castors (a.k.a. Temple of Castor and Pollux) that was completed in 484 B.C.E. and was dedicated to the Gemini who had aided the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 B.C.E. The temple had several construction phases. The Sacra Via&nbsp;passed along the forum square en route to the Capitoline Hill and the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. This sacred route was used for certain state-level ceremonies, especially the celebration of the victory ritual known as the Roman triumph.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Temple of Vesta\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8a44fb3981a08f0458e14bb1cf92414c195a9bcf.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Temple of Vesta</span></span>Two other early, sacred buildings are important to note. These are the Regia or &quot;king&rsquo;s house&quot;&nbsp;and the Temple of Vesta, both located on the downward slope of the Palatine Hill near the point where it reaches the edge of the Forum Romanum proper. Both of these sacred buildings are quite ancient and had many building phases, making it difficult to refine the chronology of the earliest phases. The Regia served as a ceremonial home for the king&mdash;later passing into the ownership of the pontifex maximus (principal state-level priesthood) once the kings had been expelled&mdash;and consisted of an irregularly planned suite of rooms surrounding a courtyard. The sixth century B.C.E. phase was decorated with painted plaques of architectural terracotta, clearly indicating both elite function and investment. Across the way was the Temple of Vesta, focused on the maternal elements of the archaic state as well as safeguarding the cult of Vesta and the sacred, eternal hearth flame of the Roman people. Both the Regia and the Temple of Vesta developed from crude structures in earlier phases to stone-built architecture in later phases. The Severan family carried out the final significant&nbsp;restoration of the Temple of Vesta in 191 C.E..</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Meeting spaces</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Important meeting spaces for political bodies emerged at the northwest side of the forum, namely a pair of complexes known as the Curia and Comitium. The Curia served as the council house for the Roman Senate, although the Senate could convene in any inaugurated space (i.e. a space ritually demarcated by Roman priests). The Curia emerged perhaps in the seventh century B.C.E., although little is known about its earliest phases. The surviving Curia is an imperial rebuilding of the Late Republican phase known as the Curia Julia, since Julius Caesar was its architectural patron. The Comitium was a tiered space that lay in front of the Curia that served as an open-air meeting space for public assemblies. Little of the Comitium remains today but it was a key architectural complex for political and sacred events during the time of the Roman Republic.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>From Republic to Empire</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the fourth and third centuries B.C.E. the Forum Romanum certainly continued to develop, but material remains of large-scale architecture have proven elusive and thus our understanding of the space during those centuries is less clear than in other periods. One middle Republican development is the continued elaboration of the Rostra, the platform from which orators would speak to those assembled in the forum square. This monument would continue to develop over time and took its name from the prows (<em>rostra</em>) of defeated enemy warships that were mounted on its fa&ccedil;ade.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The later second and first centuries B.C.E., the Late Republican period, witnessed many changes in the city and in the Forum Romanum. The successes of Rome and her growing empire during the second and first centuries B.C.E. led to a great deal of monumental construction in the city, including in the Forum Romanum itself. It was during this Late Republican phase that Rome became a metropolitan center, equipped with the monumental architecture that could compete with&mdash;if not eclipse&mdash;that of the foreign powers Rome had tamed during the Punic Wars and those against the Hellenistic kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean. In particular the Romans established a&nbsp;tradition of constructing monuments commemorating famous men who had achieved great success in military and public careers. The first of these was the <em>Columna Rostrata</em> that marked the naval victory of Caius Duilius at the naval battle of Mylae in 260 B.C.E. The Roman interest in monumental, commemorative monuments, now referred to as triumphal arches, would soon follow.&nbsp;The first of these, the Fabian arch (<em>fornix Fabianus</em>), was dedicated on the Sacra Via toward the eastern end of the Forum Romanum in 121 B.C.E., commemorating the military victories (and family) of Quintus Fabius Allobrogicus (Cicero <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/474/28/0#4\">pro Planc. 17</a>). While the Fabian monument is no longer extant, its construction established a tradition&nbsp;(and a traditional form) for official commemorative and honorific monuments in the context of Roman public art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Basilica</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The second century B.C.E. saw the creation and introduction of a unique Roman building type, the basilica. The basilica was a columnar hall that often had a multi-purpose use&mdash;from law courts to commerce to entertainments. Roman planners came to prefer them for lining the long sides of open squares, in a way not dissimilar from the Greek stoa. The sources claim that the Basilica Porcia (c. 184 B.C.E.) was the first basilica built at Rome, although no trace of it remains. The Basilica Porcia served as an office for the tribunes of the plebs. Other, more elaborate basilicae were soon to be built, including the famous Basilica Aemilia, first built in 179 B.C.E., and remodeled from c. 55 to 34 B.C.E. as the Basilica Paulli. Restored again after a fire in 14 B.C.E., the famous basilica was deemed by Pliny the Elder to be one of the three most beautiful monuments in Rome (Plin. <em>HN</em> <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/978/1/0#2619\">36.102.5</a>)</p>\n"

"<h3>Imperial period</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The advent of the principate of Augustus (27 B.C.E. &ndash; 14 C.E.) brought about additions and renovations to the Forum Romanum. With the deification of Julius Caesar, Augustus&rsquo; adoptive father, a temple dedicated to Caesar&rsquo;s cult (<em>templum&nbsp;divi Iulii</em>) was constructed on the edge of the forum square (15 in the diagram below).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus restored existing buildings, completed incomplete projects, and added commemorative projects to celebrate his own accomplishments and those of his family members. In this latter group, the Arch of Augustus (#16 above) and the Porticus of Caius and Lucius are notable. The former was a triumphal arch celebrating significant military and diplomatic accomplishments of the emperor, while the latter honored the emperor&rsquo;s grandsons. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus also followed Julius Caesar in creating yet another new forum space beyond the Forum Romanum that was named the Forum of Augustus.&nbsp;(dedicated in 2 B.C.E.). These new Imperial Fora in some cases provided additional space and, in turn, shifted attention away from the Forum Romanum.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Imperial period the Forum Romanum itself saw only sporadic new construction, although the maintenance of the existing structures would have provided a pressing and ongoing obligation. Just beyond the limit of the forum proper the second century C.E. temple of Antoninus Pius and his wife Faustina was constructed in 141 C.E. (and then modified in 161 C.E. following the emperor&rsquo;s death).&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Decline</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Declining imperial fortunes led inevitably to urban decay at Rome. After the Severan and Tetrarchic building programs of the third century C.E. and Constantinian investment in the early fourth century C.E., the forum and its environs began to decline and decay.&nbsp;Constantine I officially relocated the administrative center of the Roman world to Constantinople in 330 C.E. and Theodosius I suppressed all &quot;pagan&quot;&nbsp;religions and ordered temples shut permanently in 394 C.E. These changes, coupled with population decline, spelled the gradual demise of spaces like the Forum Romanum. Roman monuments were cannibalized for building materials and open, unused spaces were re-purposed&mdash;sometimes as ad hoc dwellings and other times for the deposition of rubbish and fill. Thus the forum slowly yielded its sacro-civic functions to more mundane concerns like pasturage&mdash;in fact it eventually came to be known as the &ldquo;Campo Vaccino&rdquo; (cow field).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The beauty of the ruins</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monument that is considered to be the final ancient structure erected in the Forum Romanum is a re-purposed monumental column set in place by the emperor Phocas in August of 608 C.E. The anonymous Einsiedeln itinerary, written in the eighth century C.E., mentions a general state of decay in the forum. A major earthquake in 847 C.E. wreaked considerable damage on remaining Roman monuments in the forum and in its environs. During the Middle Ages ancient structures provided reusable buildings materials, as well as reusable foundations, for Medieval structures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ruins themselves provided endless inspiration for artists, including painters the likes of Canaletto who became interested in the romanticism of the ruins of the ancient city as well as for cartographers and engravers the likes of G. B. Piranesi and G. Vasi, among others, who created views of the ruins themselves and restored plans of the ancient city.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Forum Romanum, despite being a relatively small space, was central to the function and identity of the city of Rome (and the wider Roman empire). The Forum Romanum played a key role in creating&nbsp;a communal focal point, one toward which various members of a diverse socio-economic community could gravitate. In that centralized space community rituals that served a larger purpose of group unity could be performed and observed and elites could reinforce social hierarchy through the display of monumental art and architecture. These devices that could create and continually reinforce not only a sense of community belonging but also the existing social hierarchy were of vital importance in archaic states. Even as the Forum Romanum changed over time, it remained an important space. After a series of emperors chose to build new forum complexes (the Imperial Fora)&nbsp;adjacent to the Forum Romanum, it retained its symbolic importance, especially considering that, as a people, ancient Romans were incredibly loyal to ancestral practices and traditions.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Rediscovery and excavation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of the monuments of the Forum Romanum, along with ancient occupation levels, gradually disappeared from view. Systematic exploration and study began under archaeologist Carlo Fea who started to clear the area near the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803. Study continued during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with prominent scholars including Rodolfo Lanciani, Giacomo Boni, Einar Gjerstad,&nbsp;and Andrea Carandini, among others, leading major campaigns. Study and excavation&mdash;as well as the hugely important obligation of preservation&mdash;continue in the Forum Romanum today. The bulk of the forum is accessible to visitors who have the opportunity to experience one of the great documents of urban archaeology.</p>\n"

In his summary, Plautus gives the reader the sense that one could find just about every sort of person in the forum&mdash;from criminals and hustlers to politicians and&nbsp;prostitutes. His summary reminds us that in the city of Rome the Forum Romanum was the key political, ritual, and civic center. Located in a valley separating the Capitoline and Palatine Hills, the Forum developed from the earliest times and remained in use after the city&rsquo;s eventual decline; during that span of time the forum witnessed the growth and eventual contraction of the city and her empire.&nbsp;The archaeological remains of the Forum Romanum&nbsp;itself continue to provide important insights into the phases and processes associated with urbanism and monumentality in ancient Rome.</p>\n"

"<p>The traditional foundation narrative holds that one of the first acts of Romulus, the city&rsquo;s eponymous founder, was to establish a fortification wall around the Palatine Hill, the site of his new settlement. The Capitoline Hill, opposite the Palatine, emerged as the city&rsquo;s citadel (<em>arx</em>) and site of the poliadic cult of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, among others (poliadic:&nbsp;the chief civic cult of an ancient city, derived from the Greek word &quot;polis&quot;).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Iron Age populations had used the marshy valley separating the Palatine and Capitoline hills as a necropolis (a large ancient cemetery), but the burgeoning settlement of archaic Rome had need of communal space and the valley was repurposed from a necropolis to a usable space.

Ammerman have shown, a deliberate landfill project deposited fill in the forum valley in order to create usable, dry levels during the sixth century B.C.E. Twentieth century excavators, including Giacomo Boni and Einar Gjerstad, revealed important remains of Iron Age burials that pre-dated the establishment of the forum valley as a civic space; in particular the necropolis in the area known as the <em>Sepulcretum</em> along the Sacra Via (&quot;Sacred Way,&quot; the&nbsp;main sacred processional road of the city)&nbsp;has been extensively studied and published.&nbsp;The investigations of the burials themselves, and the patterns they followed, have allowed archaeologists to understand not only funeral customs but also social dynamics during Rome&rsquo;s proto-urban phases.<br />\n"

"<p>This major investment in the creation of civic space and the organization of labor also provides important information about the socio-economic structure of early Rome (Livy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi0011.perseus-eng3\">1.59.9</a>). The drainage canal eventually came to have a vaulted covering and was known as the <em>Cloaca Maxima</em> or &quot;Great Drain.&quot;&nbsp;One of the clear outcomes of these civic investments was the creation of a usable space that came to be a civic focus for activities in many spheres, especially political and sacred functions.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Temples and sacred buildings</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the Early Republican period the forum space saw the construction of key temples. One of the most prominent early temples is the Temple of Saturn (often considered the earliest of the temples in the Forum Romanum), the first iteration of which dates c. 498 B.C.E. The temple was dedicated to Saturn, the god of agriculture, and housed the state treasury. The temple was rebuilt in 42 B.C.E. and again after 283 C.E. Another early Republican temple is the Temple of the Castors (a.k.a. Temple of Castor and Pollux) that was completed in 484 B.C.E. and was dedicated to the Gemini who had aided the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 B.C.E. The temple had several construction phases. The Sacra Via&nbsp;passed along the forum square en route to the Capitoline Hill and the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. This sacred route was used for certain state-level ceremonies, especially the celebration of the victory ritual known as the Roman triumph.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Temple of Vesta\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8a44fb3981a08f0458e14bb1cf92414c195a9bcf.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Temple of Vesta</span></span>Two other early, sacred buildings are important to note. These are the Regia or &quot;king&rsquo;s house&quot;&nbsp;and the Temple of Vesta, both located on the downward slope of the Palatine Hill near the point where it reaches the edge of the Forum Romanum proper. Both of these sacred buildings are quite ancient and had many building phases, making it difficult to refine the chronology of the earliest phases. The Regia served as a ceremonial home for the king&mdash;later passing into the ownership of the pontifex maximus (principal state-level priesthood) once the kings had been expelled&mdash;and consisted of an irregularly planned suite of rooms surrounding a courtyard. The sixth century B.C.E. phase was decorated with painted plaques of architectural terracotta, clearly indicating both elite function and investment. Across the way was the Temple of Vesta, focused on the maternal elements of the archaic state as well as safeguarding the cult of Vesta and the sacred, eternal hearth flame of the Roman people. Both the Regia and the Temple of Vesta developed from crude structures in earlier phases to stone-built architecture in later phases. The Severan family carried out the final significant&nbsp;restoration of the Temple of Vesta in 191 C.E..</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Meeting spaces</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Important meeting spaces for political bodies emerged at the northwest side of the forum, namely a pair of complexes known as the Curia and Comitium. The Curia served as the council house for the Roman Senate, although the Senate could convene in any inaugurated space (i.e. a space ritually demarcated by Roman priests). The Curia emerged perhaps in the seventh century B.C.E., although little is known about its earliest phases. The surviving Curia is an imperial rebuilding of the Late Republican phase known as the Curia Julia, since Julius Caesar was its architectural patron. The Comitium was a tiered space that lay in front of the Curia that served as an open-air meeting space for public assemblies. Little of the Comitium remains today but it was a key architectural complex for political and sacred events during the time of the Roman Republic.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>From Republic to Empire</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the fourth and third centuries B.C.E. the Forum Romanum certainly continued to develop, but material remains of large-scale architecture have proven elusive and thus our understanding of the space during those centuries is less clear than in other periods. One middle Republican development is the continued elaboration of the Rostra, the platform from which orators would speak to those assembled in the forum square. This monument would continue to develop over time and took its name from the prows (<em>rostra</em>) of defeated enemy warships that were mounted on its fa&ccedil;ade.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The later second and first centuries B.C.E., the Late Republican period, witnessed many changes in the city and in the Forum Romanum. The successes of Rome and her growing empire during the second and first centuries B.C.E. led to a great deal of monumental construction in the city, including in the Forum Romanum itself. It was during this Late Republican phase that Rome became a metropolitan center, equipped with the monumental architecture that could compete with&mdash;if not eclipse&mdash;that of the foreign powers Rome had tamed during the Punic Wars and those against the Hellenistic kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean. In particular the Romans established a&nbsp;tradition of constructing monuments commemorating famous men who had achieved great success in military and public careers. The first of these was the <em>Columna Rostrata</em> that marked the naval victory of Caius Duilius at the naval battle of Mylae in 260 B.C.E. The Roman interest in monumental, commemorative monuments, now referred to as triumphal arches, would soon follow.&nbsp;The first of these, the Fabian arch (<em>fornix Fabianus</em>), was dedicated on the Sacra Via toward the eastern end of the Forum Romanum in 121 B.C.E., commemorating the military victories (and family) of Quintus Fabius Allobrogicus (Cicero <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/474/28/0#4\">pro Planc. 17</a>). While the Fabian monument is no longer extant, its construction established a tradition&nbsp;(and a traditional form) for official commemorative and honorific monuments in the context of Roman public art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Basilica</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The second century B.C.E. saw the creation and introduction of a unique Roman building type, the basilica. The basilica was a columnar hall that often had a multi-purpose use&mdash;from law courts to commerce to entertainments. Roman planners came to prefer them for lining the long sides of open squares, in a way not dissimilar from the Greek stoa. The sources claim that the Basilica Porcia (c. 184 B.C.E.) was the first basilica built at Rome, although no trace of it remains. The Basilica Porcia served as an office for the tribunes of the plebs. Other, more elaborate basilicae were soon to be built, including the famous Basilica Aemilia, first built in 179 B.C.E., and remodeled from c. 55 to 34 B.C.E. as the Basilica Paulli. Restored again after a fire in 14 B.C.E., the famous basilica was deemed by Pliny the Elder to be one of the three most beautiful monuments in Rome (Plin. <em>HN</em> <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/978/1/0#2619\">36.102.5</a>)</p>\n"

"<h3>Imperial period</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The advent of the principate of Augustus (27 B.C.E. &ndash; 14 C.E.) brought about additions and renovations to the Forum Romanum. With the deification of Julius Caesar, Augustus&rsquo; adoptive father, a temple dedicated to Caesar&rsquo;s cult (<em>templum&nbsp;divi Iulii</em>) was constructed on the edge of the forum square (15 in the diagram below).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus restored existing buildings, completed incomplete projects, and added commemorative projects to celebrate his own accomplishments and those of his family members. In this latter group, the Arch of Augustus (#16 above) and the Porticus of Caius and Lucius are notable. The former was a triumphal arch celebrating significant military and diplomatic accomplishments of the emperor, while the latter honored the emperor&rsquo;s grandsons. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus also followed Julius Caesar in creating yet another new forum space beyond the Forum Romanum that was named the Forum of Augustus.&nbsp;(dedicated in 2 B.C.E.). These new Imperial Fora in some cases provided additional space and, in turn, shifted attention away from the Forum Romanum.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Imperial period the Forum Romanum itself saw only sporadic new construction, although the maintenance of the existing structures would have provided a pressing and ongoing obligation. Just beyond the limit of the forum proper the second century C.E. temple of Antoninus Pius and his wife Faustina was constructed in 141 C.E. (and then modified in 161 C.E. following the emperor&rsquo;s death).&nbsp;<br />\n"

The third century C.E. saw rebuilding of structures and monuments that had been damaged by fire, including the rebuilding of the Curia Julia by the emperor Diocletian in the late third century C.E. following a fire in 283 C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Decline</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Declining imperial fortunes led inevitably to urban decay at Rome. After the Severan and Tetrarchic building programs of the third century C.E. and Constantinian investment in the early fourth century C.E., the forum and its environs began to decline and decay.&nbsp;Constantine I officially relocated the administrative center of the Roman world to Constantinople in 330 C.E. and Theodosius I suppressed all &quot;pagan&quot;&nbsp;religions and ordered temples shut permanently in 394 C.E. These changes, coupled with population decline, spelled the gradual demise of spaces like the Forum Romanum. Roman monuments were cannibalized for building materials and open, unused spaces were re-purposed&mdash;sometimes as ad hoc dwellings and other times for the deposition of rubbish and fill. Thus the forum slowly yielded its sacro-civic functions to more mundane concerns like pasturage&mdash;in fact it eventually came to be known as the &ldquo;Campo Vaccino&rdquo; (cow field).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The beauty of the ruins</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monument that is considered to be the final ancient structure erected in the Forum Romanum is a re-purposed monumental column set in place by the emperor Phocas in August of 608 C.E. The anonymous Einsiedeln itinerary, written in the eighth century C.E., mentions a general state of decay in the forum. A major earthquake in 847 C.E. wreaked considerable damage on remaining Roman monuments in the forum and in its environs. During the Middle Ages ancient structures provided reusable buildings materials, as well as reusable foundations, for Medieval structures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ruins themselves provided endless inspiration for artists, including painters the likes of Canaletto who became interested in the romanticism of the ruins of the ancient city as well as for cartographers and engravers the likes of G. B. Piranesi and G. Vasi, among others, who created views of the ruins themselves and restored plans of the ancient city.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Forum Romanum, despite being a relatively small space, was central to the function and identity of the city of Rome (and the wider Roman empire). The Forum Romanum played a key role in creating&nbsp;a communal focal point, one toward which various members of a diverse socio-economic community could gravitate. In that centralized space community rituals that served a larger purpose of group unity could be performed and observed and elites could reinforce social hierarchy through the display of monumental art and architecture. These devices that could create and continually reinforce not only a sense of community belonging but also the existing social hierarchy were of vital importance in archaic states. Even as the Forum Romanum changed over time, it remained an important space. After a series of emperors chose to build new forum complexes (the Imperial Fora)&nbsp;adjacent to the Forum Romanum, it retained its symbolic importance, especially considering that, as a people, ancient Romans were incredibly loyal to ancestral practices and traditions.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Rediscovery and excavation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of the monuments of the Forum Romanum, along with ancient occupation levels, gradually disappeared from view. Systematic exploration and study began under archaeologist Carlo Fea who started to clear the area near the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803. Study continued during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with prominent scholars including Rodolfo Lanciani, Giacomo Boni, Einar Gjerstad,&nbsp;and Andrea Carandini, among others, leading major campaigns. Study and excavation&mdash;as well as the hugely important obligation of preservation&mdash;continue in the Forum Romanum today. The bulk of the forum is accessible to visitors who have the opportunity to experience one of the great documents of urban archaeology.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> are located in an area bounded on the southwest by the Capitoline Hill, on the northeast by the Quirinal Hill, and extending toward the Esquiline Hill to the east. The <em>fora</em> were initially built between c. 54 B.C.E. and 113 C.E., with continuing additions, restorations, and modifications through late antiquity. In the middle ages the <em>fora</em> were spaces re-used for building materials, housing, industry, and burials. Gradually these spaces faded from view, buried beneath the medieval and modern city of Rome. A massive campaign of excavation in the twentieth century on the orders of the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini returned large areas of the <em>fora</em> to view. Ongoing archaeological investigation continues to reveal additional elements of the <em>fora</em> and to provide additional data that allow for their contextualization.</p>\n"

"<h3>Forum of Julius Caesar</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The Forum of Julius Caesar (also known as the<em> Forum Iulium</em> or <em>Forum Caesaris</em>) was the first of the imperial <em>fora </em>complexes to be built. Pompey the Great, a political rival of Caesar, had dedicated a monumental theater and portico complex in the Campus Martius in 55 B.C.E. and this perhaps spurred Caesar&rsquo;s ambition to construct a new forum complex. Caesar&rsquo;s project required the acquisition of land at the flank of the Capitoline Hill and he was aided in this early on by political allies, including Cicero, with the initial land purchased at a cost of sixty million sesterces (Cic. <em>ad Att</em>. 4.16.9).&nbsp;Additional land</span></p>\n"

The construction of Caesar&rsquo;s forum resulted in significant reorganization of the northwest corner of the Forum Romanum.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"The Forum of Caesar takes the form of a&nbsp;rectangle measuring 160 by 75 m. The centerpiece of the complex was the Temple of Venus Genetrix, dedicated to the goddess that Caesar celebrated as his distant ancestor. The octastyle (eight columns across the fa&ccedil;ade) temple was made of solid marble and sat&nbsp;atop a high podium.

"\n"
"<p>The Forum of Augustus (known as the <em>Forum Augustum</em> or <em>Forum Augusti</em>) followed the Forum of Caesar as the second of the imperial <em>fora.</em>&nbsp; At the Battle of Philippi in 42 B.C.E.,&nbsp;Augustus vowed a temple to&nbsp;Mars in exchange for help in avenging the slain Caesar&nbsp;(Suet. <em>Aug</em>. 29.2), but the temple and forum complex would not be dedicated until 2 B.C.E. (<em>Res Gestae</em> 21).&nbsp;The Forum of Augustus provided additional room for the meeting of law courts and was built on land acquired by Augustus.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Flanking the temple in the exedrae (the semicircular, recessed areas behind the colonnades to the left and right&nbsp;of the temple)&nbsp;of the porticoes were sculptural groups depicting both Romulus and Aeneas, thus connecting Augustus to Rome&rsquo;s two legendary founders (Ovid&nbsp;<em>Fasti </em>5.549-570).&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>To complete the narrative cycle, statues of famous Romans of the Republican period adorned the attic of the porticoes. These famous men (<em>summi viri</em>) were portrayed alongside small, inscribed plaques (<em>tituli</em>) bearing their political and military accomplishments. In this way, Augustus portrayed himself as the ideal man to lead the Roman state; he was&nbsp;connected to Rome&rsquo;s divine origins and he represented continuity with&nbsp;its republican tradition. This powerful&nbsp;visual narrative represents an important early use of public art to transmit ideological messages in the western world.</p>\n"

Pliny the Elder deemed the Forum of Augustus one of three most beautiful monuments in the city of Rome (Pliny the Elder <em>Natural History</em> 36.102.5).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Templum Pacis / Forum of Vespasian</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The next imperial forum to be built was commissioned by the emperor Vespasian following the suppression of the Great Jewish Revolt that lasted from 66 to 73 C.E. Vespasian came to power following civil chaos in 69 C.E. and, together with his eldest son, Titus, suppressed the revolt and sacked the city of Jerusalem. During the summer of 71 C.E. Vespasian and Titus jointly celebrated a lavish triumph at Rome&mdash;an ancient ritual celebrating significant military victories. One of the key tenets of Vespasian&rsquo;s new administration was the restoration of the city, including the construction of new buildings and monuments. He dedicated a forum complex that housed a temple dedicated to Peace (<em>Pax</em>) in 71 C.E., completing it by 75 C.E. (Flavius Josephus <em>Jewish War</em> 7.5.7). This innovative complex was deemed one of Rome&rsquo;s most beautiful monuments by Pliny the Elder and housed not only significant spoils from Jerusalem but also masterworks of Greek art that had previously been hoarded by the emperor Nero.</p>\n"

Rather than featuring a central temple seated atop a prominent podium, the Templum Pacis complex consists of a square portico (dimensions 110 x 135 m) with the temple itself set within the eastern side of the portico, flanked by ancillary rooms. This left the square itself open for the installation of decorative water features and plantings which are seen both archaeologically and on fragments of the Severan marble plan of the city of Rome (<em>forma urbis Romae</em>) that was mounted in the forum complex in the third century C.E. The fragments of the Severan plan provide valuable information about the design of this architectural complex and has led scholars to speculate that&nbsp;the inspiration for its design may have been the great market (<em>macellum magnum</em>) of the city that had likely been destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. It is especially significant to note that this is a public space and that Vespasian&rsquo;s generosity granted the populace of Rome access not only to a beautiful, monumental square, but also to art&nbsp;and the spoils of military&nbsp;victory (including spoils from the Temple in Jerusalem).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Forum Transitorium, also referred to as the Forum of Nerva, was begun by Domitian, the younger son of Vespasian. Incomplete at the time of Domitian&rsquo;s assassination in 96 C.E., the complex was completed by Nerva in 97 C.E. This is a narrow forum complex that abuts both the Forum of Augustus and the Templum Pacis and is constrained by these pre-existing structures (dimensions: 131 x 45 meters); as well as&nbsp;the Argiletum, a&nbsp;street that ran the length of the forum. The Forum Transitorium&rsquo;s temple was sacred to Minerva, who had been a patron divinity of Domitian, and the architectural sculpture that decorated&nbsp;the porticoes featured&nbsp;imagery connected to Minerva and scenes from the private lives of women.</p>\n"

"<p>The Forum of Trajan (<em>Forum Traiani</em>), the final imperial forum, was both the largest and the most lavish. Inaugurated in 112 C.E., the architectural complex relied upon imposing architectural and sculptural features to glorify the accomplishments and principate&nbsp;of the emperor Trajan. The elaborate forum complex has a vast footprint, measuring 200 x 120 meters. The open square of the forum is flanked by porticoes that contain exedrae and point viewer attention toward the main structure, the massive Basilica Ulpia. The architect Apollodorus of Damascus was responsible for the innovative design. On the western side of the basilica was another courtyard, flanked by two libraries (one Greek and one Latin), that contained a monumental honorific column, known today as the Column of Trajan.</p>\n"

The column stands 38 meters tall and its frieze wraps around the column shaft 23 times, with a total length of roughly&nbsp;190 meters.

(<em>Historia Augusta - Hadrian</em> 19.9). An ongoing point of scholarly contention is the position and appearance of this plan. Traditional reconstructions favor a free-standing temple at the western end of the forum, while more recent reconstructions instead favor a shrine positioned against the western exedra of the Forum of Augustus. Ongoing archaeological fieldwork may yet shed light on this contentious topographical debate.</p>\n"

"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> represent important architectural landscapes in the city of Rome. They demonstrate the efficacy of public art and architecture with respect to creating collective identity and communicating clear&nbsp;messages that both disseminate and reinforce ideology. The strength and accomplishments of the Roman state, not to mention its stability, are key&nbsp;themes in any such program of message making. We should also not underestimate the psychological effect of these grandiose, soaring, bedecked complexes,&nbsp;based around massive open plazas,&nbsp;on the minds and experiences of city dwellers (many of whom lived in crowded squalor). The Imperial <em>fora</em> demonstrate that within the mechanisms of Roman urbanism, civic architecture occupies a crucial role. We are reminded of this efficacy by an ancient example that is perhaps no different from the reaction of a modern visitor to the city of Rome. The emperor Constantius II, visiting Rome in the mid-fourth century C.E., was amazed by the Forum of Trajan, something he considered &ldquo;a construction unique under the heavens&rdquo; (Ammianus Marcellinus 16.10.15).</p>\n"

"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> are located in an area bounded on the southwest by the Capitoline Hill, on the northeast by the Quirinal Hill, and extending toward the Esquiline Hill to the east. The <em>fora</em> were initially built between c. 54 B.C.E. and 113 C.E., with continuing additions, restorations, and modifications through late antiquity. In the middle ages the <em>fora</em> were spaces re-used for building materials, housing, industry, and burials. Gradually these spaces faded from view, buried beneath the medieval and modern city of Rome. A massive campaign of excavation in the twentieth century on the orders of the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini returned large areas of the <em>fora</em> to view. Ongoing archaeological investigation continues to reveal additional elements of the <em>fora</em> and to provide additional data that allow for their contextualization.</p>\n"

"<p><span>The Forum of Julius Caesar (also known as the<em> Forum Iulium</em> or <em>Forum Caesaris</em>) was the first of the imperial <em>fora </em>complexes to be built. Pompey the Great, a political rival of Caesar, had dedicated a monumental theater and portico complex in the Campus Martius in 55 B.C.E. and this perhaps spurred Caesar&rsquo;s ambition to construct a new forum complex. Caesar&rsquo;s project required the acquisition of land at the flank of the Capitoline Hill and he was aided in this early on by political allies, including Cicero, with the initial land purchased at a cost of sixty million sesterces (Cic. <em>ad Att</em>. 4.16.9).&nbsp;Additional land</span></p>\n"

"<p>To complete the narrative cycle, statues of famous Romans of the Republican period adorned the attic of the porticoes. These famous men (<em>summi viri</em>) were portrayed alongside small, inscribed plaques (<em>tituli</em>) bearing their political and military accomplishments. In this way, Augustus portrayed himself as the ideal man to lead the Roman state; he was&nbsp;connected to Rome&rsquo;s divine origins and he represented continuity with&nbsp;its republican tradition. This powerful&nbsp;visual narrative represents an important early use of public art to transmit ideological messages in the western world.</p>\n"

The emperor Tiberius added two arches in 19 C.E. meant to honor the German victories of Drusus and Germanicus (Tacitus<em> Annales</em> 2.64; <em>CIL</em> 6.911) and the emperor Hadrian restored the forum complex in the second century. Pliny the Elder deemed the Forum of Augustus one of three most beautiful monuments in the city of Rome (Pliny the Elder <em>Natural History</em> 36.102.5).</p>\n"

"<h3>Templum Pacis / Forum of Vespasian</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The next imperial forum to be built was commissioned by the emperor Vespasian following the suppression of the Great Jewish Revolt that lasted from 66 to 73 C.E. Vespasian came to power following civil chaos in 69 C.E. and, together with his eldest son, Titus, suppressed the revolt and sacked the city of Jerusalem. During the summer of 71 C.E. Vespasian and Titus jointly celebrated a lavish triumph at Rome&mdash;an ancient ritual celebrating significant military victories. One of the key tenets of Vespasian&rsquo;s new administration was the restoration of the city, including the construction of new buildings and monuments. He dedicated a forum complex that housed a temple dedicated to Peace (<em>Pax</em>) in 71 C.E., completing it by 75 C.E. (Flavius Josephus <em>Jewish War</em> 7.5.7). This innovative complex was deemed one of Rome&rsquo;s most beautiful monuments by Pliny the Elder and housed not only significant spoils from Jerusalem but also masterworks of Greek art that had previously been hoarded by the emperor Nero.</p>\n"

Rather than featuring a central temple seated atop a prominent podium, the Templum Pacis complex consists of a square portico (dimensions 110 x 135 m) with the temple itself set within the eastern side of the portico, flanked by ancillary rooms. This left the square itself open for the installation of decorative water features and plantings which are seen both archaeologically and on fragments of the Severan marble plan of the city of Rome (<em>forma urbis Romae</em>) that was mounted in the forum complex in the third century C.E. The fragments of the Severan plan provide valuable information about the design of this architectural complex and has led scholars to speculate that&nbsp;the inspiration for its design may have been the great market (<em>macellum magnum</em>) of the city that had likely been destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. It is especially significant to note that this is a public space and that Vespasian&rsquo;s generosity granted the populace of Rome access not only to a beautiful, monumental square, but also to art&nbsp;and the spoils of military&nbsp;victory (including spoils from the Temple in Jerusalem).</p>\n"

"<h3>Forum Transitorium</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Forum Transitorium, also referred to as the Forum of Nerva, was begun by Domitian, the younger son of Vespasian. Incomplete at the time of Domitian&rsquo;s assassination in 96 C.E., the complex was completed by Nerva in 97 C.E. This is a narrow forum complex that abuts both the Forum of Augustus and the Templum Pacis and is constrained by these pre-existing structures (dimensions: 131 x 45 meters); as well as&nbsp;the Argiletum, a&nbsp;street that ran the length of the forum. The Forum Transitorium&rsquo;s temple was sacred to Minerva, who had been a patron divinity of Domitian, and the architectural sculpture that decorated&nbsp;the porticoes featured&nbsp;imagery connected to Minerva and scenes from the private lives of women.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Forum of Trajan (<em>Forum Traiani</em>), the final imperial forum, was both the largest and the most lavish. Inaugurated in 112 C.E., the architectural complex relied upon imposing architectural and sculptural features to glorify the accomplishments and principate&nbsp;of the emperor Trajan. The elaborate forum complex has a vast footprint, measuring 200 x 120 meters. The open square of the forum is flanked by porticoes that contain exedrae and point viewer attention toward the main structure, the massive Basilica Ulpia. The architect Apollodorus of Damascus was responsible for the innovative design. On the western side of the basilica was another courtyard, flanked by two libraries (one Greek and one Latin), that contained a monumental honorific column, known today as the Column of Trajan.</p>\n"

The column stands 38 meters tall and its frieze wraps around the column shaft 23 times, with a total length of roughly&nbsp;190 meters. Carved in bas relief, the exquisite frieze carefully narrates Trajan&rsquo;s campaigns and its level of detail is simply astounding.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The column&rsquo;s frieze may draw inspiration from earlier Roman triumphal art, the tradition of which was inclined to depict scenes from the foreign campaigns and, in so doing, glorify the accomplishments of the commander and his soldiers.

(<em>Historia Augusta - Hadrian</em> 19.9). An ongoing point of scholarly contention is the position and appearance of this plan. Traditional reconstructions favor a free-standing temple at the western end of the forum, while more recent reconstructions instead favor a shrine positioned against the western exedra of the Forum of Augustus. Ongoing archaeological fieldwork may yet shed light on this contentious topographical debate.</p>\n"

"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> represent important architectural landscapes in the city of Rome. They demonstrate the efficacy of public art and architecture with respect to creating collective identity and communicating clear&nbsp;messages that both disseminate and reinforce ideology. The strength and accomplishments of the Roman state, not to mention its stability, are key&nbsp;themes in any such program of message making. We should also not underestimate the psychological effect of these grandiose, soaring, bedecked complexes,&nbsp;based around massive open plazas,&nbsp;on the minds and experiences of city dwellers (many of whom lived in crowded squalor). The Imperial <em>fora</em> demonstrate that within the mechanisms of Roman urbanism, civic architecture occupies a crucial role. We are reminded of this efficacy by an ancient example that is perhaps no different from the reaction of a modern visitor to the city of Rome. The emperor Constantius II, visiting Rome in the mid-fourth century C.E., was amazed by the Forum of Trajan, something he considered &ldquo;a construction unique under the heavens&rdquo; (Ammianus Marcellinus 16.10.15).</p>\n"

"<h3>Siena: a&nbsp;city overlooked?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries, Siena&rsquo;s role in the history of European art was underappreciated. This is partly because its moment of greatest influence occurred just before the Renaissance, a period commonly associated with the nearby city of Florence (both Florence and Siena were independent city-states in Italy at this time&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.sheltonstate.edu/Uploads/files/faculty/Chuck%20Boening/western%20civ/Renaissance%20Italy.jpg\">see this map</a>). But history&mdash;even art history&mdash;is written by the victors. So when Siena&rsquo;s position of power faded while Florence remained one of the financial and artistic centers of Europe, the achievements of Sienese artists slid slowly into the background. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians now know that the development of style in these two city-states was closely intertwined. The artists of one inevitably influenced the other, even in later periods. It is not an exaggeration to say that, at the height of its artistic flourishing, Siena was unsurpassed in its fame for producing celebrated painters.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Siena Cathedral\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b237edd2e759bf9e1024086c0378de2f3d2a4976.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Siena Cathedral</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An international city</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the early fourteenth century, Siena was a wealthy and cosmopolitan city. Several large international banks were run by wealthy Sienese families. Merchants based in Siena traded goods in several foreign countries, particularly France. The city&rsquo;s location on the Via Francigena, the main pilgrimage route to Rome, meant that pilgrims from all over Europe streamed through its streets. These pilgrims would have been greeted by one of the most impressive cityscapes in Italy at the time. Spread out over three hills, the skyline was dominated by the enormous cathedral and by the central seat of government, the Palazzo Pubblico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. \n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e3e30f4c7f901c8865774bea7bdae8ad4a3aa9a4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Communal oversight of the arts&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many cities today, the Sienese were acutely aware of how art and architecture shaped the city&rsquo;s identity in the eyes of both natives and visitors. The communal government was controlled by the &ldquo;Nove,&rdquo; or the Nine, a rotating group of representatives chosen from the city&rsquo;s leading families. The Nove dominated art patronage during the period, helping to decide the layout of the city and its largest buildings, selecting committees to oversee large public projects, and subsidizing the decoration of churches.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sienese art of the period was communally oriented in a few other ways. The central government and various churches hired local Sienese artists, almost exclusively, to produce the most important paintings. Such a preference for native sons hints at a general pride in the city&rsquo;s painters, known throughout Italy for the quality of their work (this was not the case with sculpture). There were also a few examples of large works of art created for private individuals. Compare this to Florence at the time, where rich citizens often bought the right to decorate family chapels in large churches and where painters from other cities were sometimes awarded prestigious commissions.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Duccio di Buoninsegna, The Rucellai Madonna, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence)  \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46b0b58a512e4a121a52252828059ed9db2d6299.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio di Buoninsegna,&nbsp;<em>Rucellai Madonna</em>, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>In fact, the most famous Sienese artist of the fourteenth century may have first made a name for himself in Florence. The earliest recorded work by Duccio, an artist who is often called the father of Sienese painting, was commissioned for the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This nearly fifteen-foot tall altarpiece depicting the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child introduced Duccio&rsquo;s innovative style to a wider audience. Like previous artists, Duccio was interested in creating beautiful patterns and shapes. We can see the love of surface decoration in the undulating arrangements of fabric or even in the faces of his figures. Yet he also used soft modeling with light and shade to give a sense of mass in the figures&rsquo; delicate but real bodies.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Duccio&rsquo;s ability to combine elegant lines and patterns with a fragile naturalism became a hallmark of Sienese painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Duccio, Maesta (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0994300bbf1aa960593705d69939bb15e6fd9a15.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio, <em>Maesta</em> (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell&#39;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Maest&agrave;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Santa Maria Novella altarpiece must have won Duccio fame in his own city of Siena, for he soon became a favorite painter of the commune. In 1308, he was asked to create a massive painting for the main altar in the middle of the Cathedral. The front of the altarpiece depicted the Madonna and Child sitting on a throne and surrounded by saints and angels, a subject known in Italian as a Maest&agrave;. Originally, the main scene was at the center of a set of stories and figures, all united in an elaborate wooden structure of frames covered in gold leaf. The back of the altarpiece was painted with a series of scenes from the life of Christ. Unfortunately, these panels are now dispersed in many museums. In these panels, Duccio demonstrated his unsurpassed skills of visual storytelling, capturing the imagination of contemporary viewers with his vivid depictions of the gospel stories that were so central to the faith of Siena and its visitors.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Cathedral altarpieces&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is hard to overestimate how important Duccio&rsquo;s altarpiece was for the citizens who worshiped in front of it and for the artists who studied it. The city had long ago dedicated itself to the Virgin Mary, believing her to be their special protector. In an age where painted images gave faithful viewers a channel of access to celestial figures, the Maest&agrave; became the central representation of Siena&rsquo;s powerful patron as the queen of heaven.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work&rsquo;s role as a devotional and artistic well for the city was most eloquently honored in four altarpieces painted for the chapels surrounding Duccio&rsquo;s painting. Each altarpiece depicted a scene involving Mary, so that the story of her life would have unfolded as your eye travelled along the chapels. Over the course of two decades, one altarpiece was commissioned from each of the leading Sienese painters of the day, transforming the heart of the Cathedral into something like a gallery of the great Sienese artists. This is a perfect illustration of the city&rsquo;s tendency to blend devotional piety and civic pride in large artistic projects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" Simone Martini, The Annunciation, 1333, tempera on panel, 72 1/2 x 82 5/8&quot; or 184 x 210 cm.

"\n"
"<h3>Simone Martini</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the best known of these four altarpieces is the Annunciation by Simone Martini. Building on the legacy of Duccio, Simone was also influenced by the elongated, swaying figures and elaborate architectural forms of northern European art. On the other hand, his paintings show a bit more of the kind of careful observation of the world around him that we might associate with Giotto, the leading Florentine artist at the time. Thanks to this eclectic but refined mixing of new styles, Simone&rsquo;s reputation and influence spread throughout Europe, a legacy carried on by a large workshop of assistants and students.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Lorenzetti brothers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two of the other three artists hired to paint altarpieces behind the Maest&agrave; were actually brothers: Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. While the Lorenzetti brothers worked in the Sienese style, they absorbed the art of Giotto more fully than Simone Martini and his followers did. Weighty, massive figures covered in heavy drapery populate their works, a sure sign of their familiarity with Florentine painting. Even more than Giotto and his school, both Ambrogio and Pietro experimented with using different kinds of perspective to give an illusion of depth in the spaces their figures occupy.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Good and Bad Government&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ambrogio Lorenzetti&rsquo;s artistic innovation is best captured in one of the most groundbreaking works of the late medieval period: his wall paintings in the Palazzo Pubblico. The elaborate murals were designed to remind the Nove of the consequences of good and bad governance. The scenes are particularly known for their large, sensitively depicted landscapes and cityscapes. No other monumental celebration of everyday urban and rural life survives from the period, making these scenes a turning point in the history of art.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Siena: a&nbsp;city overlooked?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries, Siena&rsquo;s role in the history of European art was underappreciated. This is partly because its moment of greatest influence occurred just before the Renaissance, a period commonly associated with the nearby city of Florence (both Florence and Siena were independent city-states in Italy at this time&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.sheltonstate.edu/Uploads/files/faculty/Chuck%20Boening/western%20civ/Renaissance%20Italy.jpg\">see this map</a>). But history&mdash;even art history&mdash;is written by the victors. So when Siena&rsquo;s position of power faded while Florence remained one of the financial and artistic centers of Europe, the achievements of Sienese artists slid slowly into the background. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians now know that the development of style in these two city-states was closely intertwined. The artists of one inevitably influenced the other, even in later periods. It is not an exaggeration to say that, at the height of its artistic flourishing, Siena was unsurpassed in its fame for producing celebrated painters.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Siena Cathedral\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b237edd2e759bf9e1024086c0378de2f3d2a4976.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Siena Cathedral</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An international city</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the early fourteenth century, Siena was a wealthy and cosmopolitan city. Several large international banks were run by wealthy Sienese families. Merchants based in Siena traded goods in several foreign countries, particularly France. The city&rsquo;s location on the Via Francigena, the main pilgrimage route to Rome, meant that pilgrims from all over Europe streamed through its streets. These pilgrims would have been greeted by one of the most impressive cityscapes in Italy at the time. Spread out over three hills, the skyline was dominated by the enormous cathedral and by the central seat of government, the Palazzo Pubblico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. \n"

"\n"
"<h3>Communal oversight of the arts&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many cities today, the Sienese were acutely aware of how art and architecture shaped the city&rsquo;s identity in the eyes of both natives and visitors. The communal government was controlled by the &ldquo;Nove,&rdquo; or the Nine, a rotating group of representatives chosen from the city&rsquo;s leading families. The Nove dominated art patronage during the period, helping to decide the layout of the city and its largest buildings, selecting committees to oversee large public projects, and subsidizing the decoration of churches.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sienese art of the period was communally oriented in a few other ways. The central government and various churches hired local Sienese artists, almost exclusively, to produce the most important paintings. Such a preference for native sons hints at a general pride in the city&rsquo;s painters, known throughout Italy for the quality of their work (this was not the case with sculpture). There were also a few examples of large works of art created for private individuals. Compare this to Florence at the time, where rich citizens often bought the right to decorate family chapels in large churches and where painters from other cities were sometimes awarded prestigious commissions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Duccio</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Duccio di Buoninsegna, The Rucellai Madonna, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence)  \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46b0b58a512e4a121a52252828059ed9db2d6299.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio di Buoninsegna,&nbsp;<em>Rucellai Madonna</em>, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>In fact, the most famous Sienese artist of the fourteenth century may have first made a name for himself in Florence. The earliest recorded work by Duccio, an artist who is often called the father of Sienese painting, was commissioned for the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This nearly fifteen-foot tall altarpiece depicting the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child introduced Duccio&rsquo;s innovative style to a wider audience. Like previous artists, Duccio was interested in creating beautiful patterns and shapes. We can see the love of surface decoration in the undulating arrangements of fabric or even in the faces of his figures. Yet he also used soft modeling with light and shade to give a sense of mass in the figures&rsquo; delicate but real bodies.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Duccio&rsquo;s ability to combine elegant lines and patterns with a fragile naturalism became a hallmark of Sienese painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Duccio, Maesta (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0994300bbf1aa960593705d69939bb15e6fd9a15.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio, <em>Maesta</em> (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell&#39;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Maest&agrave;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Santa Maria Novella altarpiece must have won Duccio fame in his own city of Siena, for he soon became a favorite painter of the commune. In 1308, he was asked to create a massive painting for the main altar in the middle of the Cathedral. The front of the altarpiece depicted the Madonna and Child sitting on a throne and surrounded by saints and angels, a subject known in Italian as a Maest&agrave;. Originally, the main scene was at the center of a set of stories and figures, all united in an elaborate wooden structure of frames covered in gold leaf. The back of the altarpiece was painted with a series of scenes from the life of Christ. Unfortunately, these panels are now dispersed in many museums. In these panels, Duccio demonstrated his unsurpassed skills of visual storytelling, capturing the imagination of contemporary viewers with his vivid depictions of the gospel stories that were so central to the faith of Siena and its visitors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Duccio, Maesta (reconstruction of back), 1308-11 (Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena)  \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/de9fbb61a91fcaa94122878011171960ef75e8ac.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio, Maesta (reconstruction of back), 1308-11 (Museo dell&#39;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Cathedral altarpieces&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is hard to overestimate how important Duccio&rsquo;s altarpiece was for the citizens who worshiped in front of it and for the artists who studied it. The city had long ago dedicated itself to the Virgin Mary, believing her to be their special protector. In an age where painted images gave faithful viewers a channel of access to celestial figures, the Maest&agrave; became the central representation of Siena&rsquo;s powerful patron as the queen of heaven.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work&rsquo;s role as a devotional and artistic well for the city was most eloquently honored in four altarpieces painted for the chapels surrounding Duccio&rsquo;s painting. Each altarpiece depicted a scene involving Mary, so that the story of her life would have unfolded as your eye travelled along the chapels. Over the course of two decades, one altarpiece was commissioned from each of the leading Sienese painters of the day, transforming the heart of the Cathedral into something like a gallery of the great Sienese artists. This is a perfect illustration of the city&rsquo;s tendency to blend devotional piety and civic pride in large artistic projects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" Simone Martini, The Annunciation, 1333, tempera on panel, 72 1/2 x 82 5/8&quot; or 184 x 210 cm.

(Uffizi, Florence) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Simone Martini</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the best known of these four altarpieces is the Annunciation by Simone Martini. Building on the legacy of Duccio, Simone was also influenced by the elongated, swaying figures and elaborate architectural forms of northern European art. On the other hand, his paintings show a bit more of the kind of careful observation of the world around him that we might associate with Giotto, the leading Florentine artist at the time. Thanks to this eclectic but refined mixing of new styles, Simone&rsquo;s reputation and influence spread throughout Europe, a legacy carried on by a large workshop of assistants and students.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Lorenzetti brothers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two of the other three artists hired to paint altarpieces behind the Maest&agrave; were actually brothers: Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. While the Lorenzetti brothers worked in the Sienese style, they absorbed the art of Giotto more fully than Simone Martini and his followers did. Weighty, massive figures covered in heavy drapery populate their works, a sure sign of their familiarity with Florentine painting. Even more than Giotto and his school, both Ambrogio and Pietro experimented with using different kinds of perspective to give an illusion of depth in the spaces their figures occupy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3d785182974044d37bee333c1a8e5fa8d88b2b8a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"> Ambrogio Lorenzetti, detail from Allegory of Good Government, Effects of Good Government in the City and the Country, c. 1337-40, fresco, Sala della Pace (Hall of Peace) also known as the Sala dei Nove (the Hall of the Nine), 7.7 x 14.4 meters (room), Palazzo Pubblico, Siena</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Good and Bad Government&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ambrogio Lorenzetti&rsquo;s artistic innovation is best captured in one of the most groundbreaking works of the late medieval period: his wall paintings in the Palazzo Pubblico. The elaborate murals were designed to remind the Nove of the consequences of good and bad governance. The scenes are particularly known for their large, sensitively depicted landscapes and cityscapes. No other monumental celebration of everyday urban and rural life survives from the period, making these scenes a turning point in the history of art.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>After the Black Death</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As in Florence, perhaps half of Siena&rsquo;s population died of the plague in 1348. Scholars think the Lorenzetti brothers were two of the Black Death&rsquo;s victims.

"<h3><span>Roman Art: When and Where</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman art is a very broad topic, spanning almost 1,000 years and three continents, from Europe into Africa and Asia. The first Roman art can be dated back to 509 B.C.E., with the legendary founding of the Roman Republic, and lasted until 330 C.E. (or much longer, if you include Byzantine art). Roman art also encompasses a broad spectrum of media including marble, painting, mosaic, gems, silver and bronze work, and terracottas, just to name a few.&nbsp;The city of Rome was a melting pot, and the Romans had no qualms about adapting artistic influences from the other Mediterranean cultures that surrounded and preceded them. For this reason it is common to see Greek, Etruscan and Egyptian influences throughout Roman art. This is not to say that all of Roman art is derivative, though, and one of the challenges for specialists is to define what is &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; about Roman art. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Doryphoros (Spear Bearer) or Canon. Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6'6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/06527f2a9dc5663aef7b38bf6f87dd7673b31758.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Doryphoros (Spear Bearer)</em>,&nbsp;Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6&#39;6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples),&nbsp;photo: Steven Zucker (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>Greek art certainly had a powerful influence on Roman practice; the Roman poet Horace famously said that &ldquo;Greece, the captive, took her savage victor captive,&rdquo; meaning that Rome (though it conquered Greece) adapted much of Greece&rsquo;s cultural and artistic heritage (as well as importing many of its most famous works). &nbsp;It is also true that many Romans commissioned versions of famous Greek works from earlier centuries; this is why we often have marble versions of lost Greek bronzes such as the <em>Doryphoros</em>&nbsp;by Polykleitos. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The Romans did not believe, as we do today, that to have a copy of an artwork was of any less value that to have the original. The copies, however, were more often variations rather than direct copies, and they had small changes made to them. The variations could be made with humor, taking the serious and somber element of Greek art and turning it on its head. So, for example, a famously gruesome Hellenistic sculpture of the satyr Marsyas being flayed was converted in a Roman dining room to a knife handle (currently in the National Archaeological Museum in Perugia). A knife was the very element that would have been used to flay the poor satyr, demonstrating not only the owner&rsquo;s knowledge of Greek mythology and important statuary,&nbsp;but also a dark sense of humor. From the direct reporting of the Greeks to the utilitarian and humorous luxury item of a Roman enthusiast, Marsyas made quite the journey. But the Roman artist was not simply copying. He was also adapting in a conscious and brilliant way.&nbsp;It is precisely this ability to adapt, convert, combine elements and add a touch of humor that makes Roman art Roman.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Republican Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mythic founding of the Roman Republic is supposed to have happened in 509 B.C.E., when the last Etruscan king, Tarquinius Superbus, was overthrown. &nbsp;During the Republican period, the Romans were governed by annually elected magistrates, the two consuls being the most important among them, and the Senate, which was the ruling body of the state. Eventually the system broke down and civil wars ensued between 100 and 42 B.C.E. The wars were finally brought to an end when Octavian (later called Augustus) defeated Mark Antony in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Marble bust of a man, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropilitan Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6607b0e560cc3dc3cce42932492accc2e348bc40.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Marble bust of a man</em>, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropolitan Museum of Art)</span></span>In the Republican period, art was produced in the service of the state, depicting public sacrifices or celebrating victorious military campaigns (like the Monument of Aemilius Paullus at Delphi). Portraiture extolled the communal goals of the Republic; hard work, age, wisdom, being a community leader and soldier. &nbsp;Patrons chose to have themselves represented with balding heads, large noses, and extra wrinkles, demonstrating that they had spent their lives working for the Republic as model citizens, flaunting their acquired wisdom with each furrow of the brow. We now call this portrait style veristic, referring to the hyper-naturalistic features that emphasize every flaw, creating portraits of individuals with personality and essence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Imperial Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus&rsquo;s rise to power in Rome signaled the end of the Roman Republic and the formation of Imperial rule. Roman art was now put to the service of aggrandizing the ruler and his family. It was also meant to indicate shifts in leadership. The major periods in Imperial Roman art are named after individual rulers or major dynasties, they are:&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Imperial art often hearkened back to the Classical art of the past. &nbsp;&ldquo;Classical&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Classicizing,&rdquo;&nbsp;when used in reference to Roman art refers broadly to the influences of Greek art from the Classical and Hellenistic periods (480-31 B.C.E.). Classicizing elements include the smooth lines, elegant drapery, idealized nude bodies, highly naturalistic forms and balanced proportions that the Greeks had perfected over centuries of practice.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus and the Julio-Claudian dynasty were particularly fond of adapting Classical elements into their art. The <em>Augustus of Primaporta </em>was made at the end of Augustus&rsquo;s life, yet he is represented as youthful, idealized and strikingly handsome like a young athlete; all hallmarks of Classical art. The emperor Hadrian was known as a philhellene, or lover of all things Greek. The emperor himself began sporting a Greek &ldquo;philosopher&rsquo;s beard&rdquo; in his official portraiture, unheard of before this time. D&eacute;cor at his rambling Villa at Tivoli included mosaic copies of famous Greek paintings, such as <em>Battle of the Centaurs</em> <em>and Wild Beasts</em> by the legendary ancient Greek painter&nbsp;Zeuxis. &nbsp;</p>\n"

(Altes Museum, Berlin)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Later Imperial art moved away from earlier Classical influences, and Severan art signals the shift to art of Late Antiquity. The characteristics of Late Antique art include frontality, stiffness of pose and drapery, deeply drilled lines, less naturalism, squat proportions and lack of individualism. Important figures are often slightly larger or are placed above the rest of the crowd to denote importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>In relief panels from the <em>Arch of Septimius Severu</em>s from Lepcis Magna, Septimius Severus and his sons, Caracalla and Geta ride in a chariot, marking them out from an otherwise uniform sea of repeating figures, all wearing the same stylized and flat drapery. There is little variation or individualism in the figures and they are all stiff and carved with deep, full lines. There is an ease to reading the work; Septimius is centrally located, between his sons and slightly taller; all the other figures direct the viewer&rsquo;s eyes to him.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Tronchin (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Constantinian art continued to integrate the elements of Late Antiquity that had been introduced in the Severan period, but they are now developed even further. For example, on the oratio relief panel on the Arch of Constantine, the figures are even more squat, frontally oriented, similar to one another, and there is a clear lack of naturalism. Again, the message is meant to be understood without hesitation: Constantine is in power.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Who Made Roman Art?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about who made Roman art. &nbsp;Artists certainly existed in antiquity but we know very little about them, especially during the Roman period, because of a lack of documentary evidence such as contracts or letters. &nbsp;What evidence we do have, such as Pliny the Elder&rsquo;s <em>Natural History</em>, pays little attention to contemporary artists and often focuses more on the Greek artists of the past. &nbsp;As a result, scholars do not refer to specific artists but consider&nbsp;them generally, as a largely anonymous group.</p>\n"

"<p>Roman art encompasses private art made for Roman homes as well as art in the public sphere.

The arches and columns (like the Arch of Titus or the Column of Trajan), marked victories, depicted war, and described military life. They also revealed foreign lands and enemies of the state. They could also depict an emperor&rsquo;s successes in domestic and foreign policy rather than in war, such as Trajan&rsquo;s Arch in Benevento. Religious art is also included in this category, such as the cult statues placed in Roman temples that stood in for the deities they represented, like Venus or Jupiter. Gods and religions from other parts of the empire also made their way to Rome&rsquo;s capital&nbsp;including the Egyptian goddess Isis, the Persian god Mithras and ultimately Christianity.

"<h3><span>Roman Art: When and Where</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman art is a very broad topic, spanning almost 1,000 years and three continents, from Europe into Africa and Asia. The first Roman art can be dated back to 509 B.C.E., with the legendary founding of the Roman Republic, and lasted until 330 C.E. (or much longer, if you include Byzantine art). Roman art also encompasses a broad spectrum of media including marble, painting, mosaic, gems, silver and bronze work, and terracottas, just to name a few.&nbsp;The city of Rome was a melting pot, and the Romans had no qualms about adapting artistic influences from the other Mediterranean cultures that surrounded and preceded them. For this reason it is common to see Greek, Etruscan and Egyptian influences throughout Roman art. This is not to say that all of Roman art is derivative, though, and one of the challenges for specialists is to define what is &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; about Roman art. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Doryphoros (Spear Bearer) or Canon. Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6'6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/06527f2a9dc5663aef7b38bf6f87dd7673b31758.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Doryphoros (Spear Bearer)</em>,&nbsp;Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6&#39;6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples),&nbsp;photo: Steven Zucker (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>Greek art certainly had a powerful influence on Roman practice; the Roman poet Horace famously said that &ldquo;Greece, the captive, took her savage victor captive,&rdquo; meaning that Rome (though it conquered Greece) adapted much of Greece&rsquo;s cultural and artistic heritage (as well as importing many of its most famous works). &nbsp;It is also true that many Romans commissioned versions of famous Greek works from earlier centuries; this is why we often have marble versions of lost Greek bronzes such as the <em>Doryphoros</em>&nbsp;by Polykleitos. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The Romans did not believe, as we do today, that to have a copy of an artwork was of any less value that to have the original. The copies, however, were more often variations rather than direct copies, and they had small changes made to them. The variations could be made with humor, taking the serious and somber element of Greek art and turning it on its head. So, for example, a famously gruesome Hellenistic sculpture of the satyr Marsyas being flayed was converted in a Roman dining room to a knife handle (currently in the National Archaeological Museum in Perugia). A knife was the very element that would have been used to flay the poor satyr, demonstrating not only the owner&rsquo;s knowledge of Greek mythology and important statuary,&nbsp;but also a dark sense of humor. From the direct reporting of the Greeks to the utilitarian and humorous luxury item of a Roman enthusiast, Marsyas made quite the journey. But the Roman artist was not simply copying. He was also adapting in a conscious and brilliant way.&nbsp;It is precisely this ability to adapt, convert, combine elements and add a touch of humor that makes Roman art Roman.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Republican Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mythic founding of the Roman Republic is supposed to have happened in 509 B.C.E., when the last Etruscan king, Tarquinius Superbus, was overthrown. &nbsp;During the Republican period, the Romans were governed by annually elected magistrates, the two consuls being the most important among them, and the Senate, which was the ruling body of the state. Eventually the system broke down and civil wars ensued between 100 and 42 B.C.E. The wars were finally brought to an end when Octavian (later called Augustus) defeated Mark Antony in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Marble bust of a man, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropilitan Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6607b0e560cc3dc3cce42932492accc2e348bc40.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Marble bust of a man</em>, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropolitan Museum of Art)</span></span>In the Republican period, art was produced in the service of the state, depicting public sacrifices or celebrating victorious military campaigns (like the Monument of Aemilius Paullus at Delphi). Portraiture extolled the communal goals of the Republic; hard work, age, wisdom, being a community leader and soldier. &nbsp;Patrons chose to have themselves represented with balding heads, large noses, and extra wrinkles, demonstrating that they had spent their lives working for the Republic as model citizens, flaunting their acquired wisdom with each furrow of the brow. We now call this portrait style veristic, referring to the hyper-naturalistic features that emphasize every flaw, creating portraits of individuals with personality and essence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Imperial Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus&rsquo;s rise to power in Rome signaled the end of the Roman Republic and the formation of Imperial rule. Roman art was now put to the service of aggrandizing the ruler and his family. It was also meant to indicate shifts in leadership. The major periods in Imperial Roman art are named after individual rulers or major dynasties, they are:&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Imperial art often hearkened back to the Classical art of the past. &nbsp;&ldquo;Classical&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Classicizing,&rdquo;&nbsp;when used in reference to Roman art refers broadly to the influences of Greek art from the Classical and Hellenistic periods (480-31 B.C.E.). Classicizing elements include the smooth lines, elegant drapery, idealized nude bodies, highly naturalistic forms and balanced proportions that the Greeks had perfected over centuries of practice.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus and the Julio-Claudian dynasty were particularly fond of adapting Classical elements into their art. The <em>Augustus of Primaporta </em>was made at the end of Augustus&rsquo;s life, yet he is represented as youthful, idealized and strikingly handsome like a young athlete; all hallmarks of Classical art. The emperor Hadrian was known as a philhellene, or lover of all things Greek. The emperor himself began sporting a Greek &ldquo;philosopher&rsquo;s beard&rdquo; in his official portraiture, unheard of before this time. D&eacute;cor at his rambling Villa at Tivoli included mosaic copies of famous Greek paintings, such as <em>Battle of the Centaurs</em> <em>and Wild Beasts</em> by the legendary ancient Greek painter&nbsp;Zeuxis. &nbsp;</p>\n"

(Altes Museum, Berlin)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Later Imperial art moved away from earlier Classical influences, and Severan art signals the shift to art of Late Antiquity. The characteristics of Late Antique art include frontality, stiffness of pose and drapery, deeply drilled lines, less naturalism, squat proportions and lack of individualism. Important figures are often slightly larger or are placed above the rest of the crowd to denote importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>In relief panels from the <em>Arch of Septimius Severu</em>s from Lepcis Magna, Septimius Severus and his sons, Caracalla and Geta ride in a chariot, marking them out from an otherwise uniform sea of repeating figures, all wearing the same stylized and flat drapery. There is little variation or individualism in the figures and they are all stiff and carved with deep, full lines. There is an ease to reading the work; Septimius is centrally located, between his sons and slightly taller; all the other figures direct the viewer&rsquo;s eyes to him.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Tronchin (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Constantinian art continued to integrate the elements of Late Antiquity that had been introduced in the Severan period, but they are now developed even further. For example, on the oratio relief panel on the Arch of Constantine, the figures are even more squat, frontally oriented, similar to one another, and there is a clear lack of naturalism. Again, the message is meant to be understood without hesitation: Constantine is in power.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Who Made Roman Art?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about who made Roman art. &nbsp;Artists certainly existed in antiquity but we know very little about them, especially during the Roman period, because of a lack of documentary evidence such as contracts or letters. &nbsp;What evidence we do have, such as Pliny the Elder&rsquo;s <em>Natural History</em>, pays little attention to contemporary artists and often focuses more on the Greek artists of the past. &nbsp;As a result, scholars do not refer to specific artists but considers them generally, as a largely anonymous group.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Easter Island is famous for its stone statues of human figures, known as <em>moai</em>&nbsp;(meaning &ldquo;statue&rdquo;). The island is known to its inhabitants as Rapa Nui.&nbsp;The <em>moai</em> were probably carved to commemorate important ancestors and were made from around 1000 C.E. until the second half of the seventeenth century.&nbsp;Over a few hundred years the inhabitants of this remote island quarried, carved and erected around 887 <em>moai</em>.&nbsp;The size and complexity of the moai increased over time, and it is believed that <em>Hoa Hakananai&#39;a</em>&nbsp;(below) dates to around 1200 C.E. It is one of only fourteen moai made from basalt, the rest are carved from the island&rsquo;s softer volcanic tuff.&nbsp;With the adoption of Christianity in the 1860s, the remaining standing <em>moai</em> were toppled.<br />\n"

Its eyes sockets were originally inlaid with red stone and coral and the sculpture was painted with red and white designs, which were washed off when it was rafted to the ship, to be taken to Europe in 1869.&nbsp;It was collected by the crew of the English ship HMS Topaze, under the command of Richard Ashmore Powell, on their visit to Easter Island in 1868 to carry out surveying work.&nbsp;Islanders helped the crew to move the statue, which has been estimated to weigh around four tons.

"<h3>The&nbsp;<em>moai</em> of&nbsp;Rapa Nui</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Easter Island is famous for its stone statues of human figures, known as <em>moai</em>&nbsp;(meaning &ldquo;statue&rdquo;). The island is known to its inhabitants as Rapa Nui.&nbsp;The <em>moai</em> were probably carved to commemorate important ancestors and were made from around 1000 C.E. until the second half of the seventeenth century.&nbsp;Over a few hundred years the inhabitants of this remote island quarried, carved and erected around 887 <em>moai</em>.&nbsp;The size and complexity of the moai increased over time, and it is believed that <em>Hoa Hakananai&#39;a</em>&nbsp;(below) dates to around 1200 C.E. It is one of only fourteen moai made from basalt, the rest are carved from the island&rsquo;s softer volcanic tuff.&nbsp;With the adoption of Christianity in the 1860s, the remaining standing <em>moai</em> were toppled.<br />\n"

"<p>This example was probably first displayed outside on a stone platform (<em>ahu)&nbsp;</em>on the sacred site of Orongo, before being moved into a stone house at the ritual center of Orongo. It would have stood with giant stone companions, their backs to the sea, keeping watch over the island. Its eyes sockets were originally inlaid with red stone and coral and the sculpture was painted with red and white designs, which were washed off when it was rafted to the ship, to be taken to Europe in 1869.&nbsp;It was collected by the crew of the English ship HMS Topaze, under the command of Richard Ashmore Powell, on their visit to Easter Island in 1868 to carry out surveying work.&nbsp;Islanders helped the crew to move the statue, which has been estimated to weigh around four tons. It was moved to the beach and then taken to the Topaze by raft.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Introduction</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>21st-century art is a burgeoning field of practice, research, and publication, making it an incredibly dynamic field of study. Many important topics have been resonating in the new century and inspiring new thinking and scholarly debate, such as the surge of bio art in response to scientific research in the life sciences, and the critical theory known as relational aesthetics that developed in response to an increase in art that invites viewers&rsquo; participation and interaction. Other topics that were much-discussed in the late 20th century remain vital for the analysis of 21st-century art and visual culture, including semiotics, post-modernism, and feminism.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art of the 21st century emerges from a vast variety of materials and means. These include the latest electronic technologies, such as digital imaging and the internet; familiar genres with a long history that continue to be practiced with great vigor, such as painting (see, for example, the work of Julie Mehretu and Shahzia Sikander); and materials and processes once associated primarily with handicrafts, re-envisioned to express new concepts. Many artists regularly and freely mix media and forms, making the choices that best serve their concepts and purposes. Activities vary from spectacular projects accomplished with huge budgets and extraordinary production values to modest endeavors that emphasize process, ephemeral experiences, and a do-it-yourself approach. The notion of influences has also shifted with changes in communications and technology; every location around the world has artists who respond to local geographies and histories as well as the sway of global visual culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Globalization</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Wangechi Mutu, Complete Prolapsus of the Uterus, 2004, Glitter, ink, collage on found medical illustration paper, 46 x 31cm\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3fec3d71652adce461f985b04a3e5c4ca2dc64a5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Wangechi Mutu, <em>Complete Prolapsus of the Uterus</em>, 2004, glitter, ink, collage on found medical illustration paper, 46 x 31cm</span></span>A key feature of the art scene in the 21st century (and of many sectors of 21st-century life) is the impact of globalization &ndash; the accelerating interconnectivity of human activity and information across time and space. Aided by the internet and mass media, awareness of the vitality of contemporary art in localities around the globe has grown exponentially. Anyone with access to the internet can follow developments in Shanghai, Sydney, S&atilde;o Paulo, or Nairobi. Simultaneously the increased movement of artists across borders and oceans has added to the intermixing of influences and artistic vocabularies. For example, Wangechi Mutu, originally from Kenya, pursued further education in South Wales and then in the United States. Her collaged images of women are informed by African tribal arts, 20th-century European and American collage artists, and the latest illustrations from fashion, pornography, and medical sources.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The meaning and consequences of globalization are much debated by scholars. Economically and politically, is globalization a force for growth and freedom in societies everywhere, or does it contribute to further exploitation of developing regions by the wealthy? Does globalization work in different ways in different localities?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Regarding globalization and art, do practices in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere challenge the traditional assumptions and value judgments that are the basis of the Western canon? Are Western institutions rethinking that canon or simply adding art from other places to their rosters in a token and uncritical gesture of inclusivity? How do curated exhibitions that address themes of globalization represent artists from various parts of the world? The expanding art market and the proliferation of biennials and art fairs helped a select group of artists from every continent to gain an international presence; but have the underlying structure and values of the art market changed otherwise?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Visual culture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 21st century visual culture has grown as a recognized interdisciplinary field of study, taking a multi-faceted approach to understanding how images of all types communicate and participate in the construction of identity, gender, class, power relationships, and other social and political meanings and values. Medicine, science, politics, consumer culture, and religion and spirituality are some of the arenas that visual culture studies examine along with art. Visual culture scholars analyze film, television, graphic novels, fashion design, and other forms of popular culture in addition to established fine art media such as painting, and they draw upon many methodologies and theories, including semiotics, sociology, psychoanalysis, reception theory, feminism, and the concept of the gaze, to name a few.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Just as visual culture scholars are examining images and media of all types so, too, are 21st-century artists drawing inspiration, imagery, materials, and concepts from diverse areas of culture, moving well beyond influences from the history of fine art and design. The world of professional sports and fanatic fans has been a topic for Paul Pfeiffer, while the commercial television industry has informed various video installations by Christian Jankowski.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Wim Delvoye, Study # 147, 2004, pencil, colour pencil, marker &amp; sticker on paper, 77 x 112 cm \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5ddbf15fb5f6a04e1c8391cc27b831b2638d294a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Wim Delvoye, <em>Study # 147</em>, 2004, pencil, colour pencil, marker &amp; sticker on paper, 77 x 112 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most contemporary artists do not draw rigid distinctions between high art and popular culture. For instance, a number of contemporary artists embrace traditional techniques of fiber art but use them to create unorthodox forms or address current social and political issues. Along these lines, Ghada Amer has used thread to embroider on canvas repeated motifs of nude women engaged in sexual acts, then partially obscured the embroidered images with gestural painted brushstrokes. Her themes include the expression and repression of female sexuality and eroticism in both Western and Islamic societies. Another example of intermixing visual cultures is the complex array of interactions between science and contemporary art, with many artists engaging with scientific imagery and ideas in their practice. For example, Wim Delvoye&rsquo;s ongoing series called Cloaca imagines humans as cyborgs, representing the human digestive system as a kind of biomechanical contraption. Finally, many 21st-century artists are deeply affected by their immersion in global visual culture, which is now made vividly present through online networks. Many artists maintain a personal website, and some create art expressly for dissemination through social media. As always, new technologies provide new opportunities and challenges.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Public and participatory art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Public art was a well-established genre by the late 20th century, attracting both traditional and experimental practitioners. Public art in the 21st century has expanded even more as a field of activity in which creative investigation can take place.

"<h3>Introduction</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>21st-century art is a burgeoning field of practice, research, and publication, making it an incredibly dynamic field of study. Many important topics have been resonating in the new century and inspiring new thinking and scholarly debate, such as the surge of bio art in response to scientific research in the life sciences, and the critical theory known as relational aesthetics that developed in response to an increase in art that invites viewers&rsquo; participation and interaction. Other topics that were much-discussed in the late 20th century remain vital for the analysis of 21st-century art and visual culture, including semiotics, post-modernism, and feminism.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art of the 21st century emerges from a vast variety of materials and means. These include the latest electronic technologies, such as digital imaging and the internet; familiar genres with a long history that continue to be practiced with great vigor, such as painting (see, for example, the work of Julie Mehretu and Shahzia Sikander); and materials and processes once associated primarily with handicrafts, re-envisioned to express new concepts. Many artists regularly and freely mix media and forms, making the choices that best serve their concepts and purposes. Activities vary from spectacular projects accomplished with huge budgets and extraordinary production values to modest endeavors that emphasize process, ephemeral experiences, and a do-it-yourself approach. The notion of influences has also shifted with changes in communications and technology; every location around the world has artists who respond to local geographies and histories as well as the sway of global visual culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Globalization</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Wangechi Mutu, Complete Prolapsus of the Uterus, 2004, Glitter, ink, collage on found medical illustration paper, 46 x 31cm\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3fec3d71652adce461f985b04a3e5c4ca2dc64a5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Wangechi Mutu, <em>Complete Prolapsus of the Uterus</em>, 2004, glitter, ink, collage on found medical illustration paper, 46 x 31cm</span></span>A key feature of the art scene in the 21st century (and of many sectors of 21st-century life) is the impact of globalization &ndash; the accelerating interconnectivity of human activity and information across time and space. Aided by the internet and mass media, awareness of the vitality of contemporary art in localities around the globe has grown exponentially. Anyone with access to the internet can follow developments in Shanghai, Sydney, S&atilde;o Paulo, or Nairobi. Simultaneously the increased movement of artists across borders and oceans has added to the intermixing of influences and artistic vocabularies. For example, Wangechi Mutu, originally from Kenya, pursued further education in South Wales and then in the United States. Her collaged images of women are informed by African tribal arts, 20th-century European and American collage artists, and the latest illustrations from fashion, pornography, and medical sources.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The meaning and consequences of globalization are much debated by scholars. Economically and politically, is globalization a force for growth and freedom in societies everywhere, or does it contribute to further exploitation of developing regions by the wealthy? Does globalization work in different ways in different localities?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Regarding globalization and art, do practices in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere challenge the traditional assumptions and value judgments that are the basis of the Western canon? Are Western institutions rethinking that canon or simply adding art from other places to their rosters in a token and uncritical gesture of inclusivity? How do curated exhibitions that address themes of globalization represent artists from various parts of the world? The expanding art market and the proliferation of biennials and art fairs helped a select group of artists from every continent to gain an international presence; but have the underlying structure and values of the art market changed otherwise?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Visual culture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 21st century visual culture has grown as a recognized interdisciplinary field of study, taking a multi-faceted approach to understanding how images of all types communicate and participate in the construction of identity, gender, class, power relationships, and other social and political meanings and values. Medicine, science, politics, consumer culture, and religion and spirituality are some of the arenas that visual culture studies examine along with art. Visual culture scholars analyze film, television, graphic novels, fashion design, and other forms of popular culture in addition to established fine art media such as painting, and they draw upon many methodologies and theories, including semiotics, sociology, psychoanalysis, reception theory, feminism, and the concept of the gaze, to name a few.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Just as visual culture scholars are examining images and media of all types so, too, are 21st-century artists drawing inspiration, imagery, materials, and concepts from diverse areas of culture, moving well beyond influences from the history of fine art and design. The world of professional sports and fanatic fans has been a topic for Paul Pfeiffer, while the commercial television industry has informed various video installations by Christian Jankowski.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Wim Delvoye, Study # 147, 2004, pencil, colour pencil, marker &amp; sticker on paper, 77 x 112 cm \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5ddbf15fb5f6a04e1c8391cc27b831b2638d294a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Wim Delvoye, <em>Study # 147</em>, 2004, pencil, colour pencil, marker &amp; sticker on paper, 77 x 112 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most contemporary artists do not draw rigid distinctions between high art and popular culture. For instance, a number of contemporary artists embrace traditional techniques of fiber art but use them to create unorthodox forms or address current social and political issues. Along these lines, Ghada Amer has used thread to embroider on canvas repeated motifs of nude women engaged in sexual acts, then partially obscured the embroidered images with gestural painted brushstrokes. Her themes include the expression and repression of female sexuality and eroticism in both Western and Islamic societies. Another example of intermixing visual cultures is the complex array of interactions between science and contemporary art, with many artists engaging with scientific imagery and ideas in their practice. For example, Wim Delvoye&rsquo;s ongoing series called Cloaca imagines humans as cyborgs, representing the human digestive system as a kind of biomechanical contraption. Finally, many 21st-century artists are deeply affected by their immersion in global visual culture, which is now made vividly present through online networks. Many artists maintain a personal website, and some create art expressly for dissemination through social media. As always, new technologies provide new opportunities and challenges.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Public and participatory art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Public art was a well-established genre by the late 20th century, attracting both traditional and experimental practitioners. Public art in the 21st century has expanded even more as a field of activity in which creative investigation can take place. In addition to continuing familiar forms such as site-specific monuments, murals, graffiti, and collaborations between artists, engineers, and architects, public art encompasses new purposes, forms, and locations, including pop-up art shops, street parades, and online projects. Public artists in the 21st century might use established approaches such as installation and performance but introduce new variations. For instance, it is now common for artists to hire other people, sometimes with special skills, to undertake performances on their behalf. In this vein, Vanessa Beecroft hired fashion models for performances, and the collaborative artists Allora &amp; Caldazilla directed professional athletes as performers in some of their installations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A pronounced tendency in the 21st century has been art that is participatory, in which the social interactions prompted by a work become its content. Often called relational art, the work literally engages the public in some way. For instance, Carsten H&ouml;ller has installed giant slides in museums for visitors to slide down, and Rirkrit Tiravanija has prepared Thai food and served it to gallery goers.

"<p><span>Like at Jericho, the deceased were placed under the floors or platforms in houses and sometimes the skulls were removed and plastered to resemble live faces. &nbsp;The burials at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k show no significant variations, either based on wealth or gender; the only bodies which were treated differently, decorated with beads and covered with ochre, were those of children.

"&nbsp;<br />\n"
"Nearly every house excavated at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k was found to contain decorations on its walls and platforms, most often in the main room of the house.

Figural paintings show the animal world alone, such as, for instance, two cranes facing each other standing behind a fox, or in interaction with people, such as a vulture pecking at a human corpse or hunting scenes. Wall reliefs are found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k with some frequency, most often representing animals, such as pairs of animals facing each other and human-like creatures. These latter reliefs, alternatively thought to be bears, goddesses or regular humans, are always represented splayed, with their heads, hands and feet removed, presumably at the time the house was abandoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The most remarkable art found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, however, are the installations of animal remains and among these the most striking are the bull bucrania. In many houses the main room was decorated with several plastered skulls of bulls set into the walls (most common on East or West walls) or platforms, the pointed horns thrust out into the communal space. Often the bucrania would be painted ochre red. In addition to these, the remains of other animals&rsquo; skulls, teeth, beaks, tusks or horns were set into the walls and platforms, plastered and painted. &nbsp;It would appear that the ancient residents of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were only interested in taking the pointy parts of the animals back to their homes!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How can we possibly understand this practice of interior decoration with the remains of animals? &nbsp;A clue might be in the types of creatures found and represented. Most of the animals represented in the art of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were not domesticated; wild animals dominate the art at the site. &nbsp;Interestingly, examination of bone refuse shows that the majority of the meat which was consumed was of wild animals, especially bulls. The excavator believes this selection in art and cuisine had to do with the contemporary era of increased domestication of animals and what is being celebrated are the animals which are part of the memory of the recent cultural past, when hunting was much more important for survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

The excavator of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k believes that this special concern for youths at the site may be a reflection of the society becoming more sedentary and required larger numbers of children because of increased labor, exchange and inheritance needs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

Wall reliefs are found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k with some frequency, most often representing animals, such as pairs of animals facing each other and human-like creatures.

"<p>The most remarkable art found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, however, are the installations of animal remains and among these the most striking are the bull bucrania. In many houses the main room was decorated with several plastered skulls of bulls set into the walls (most common on East or West walls) or platforms, the pointed horns thrust out into the communal space. &nbsp;Often the bucrania would be painted ochre red. In addition to these, the remains of other animas&rsquo; skulls, teeth, beaks, tusks or horns were set into the walls and platforms, plastered and painted. &nbsp;It would appear that the ancient residents of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were only interested in taking the pointy parts of the animals back to their homes!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How can we possibly understand this practice of interior decoration with the remains of animals? &nbsp;A clue might be in the types of creatures found and represented. Most of the animals represented in the art of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were not domesticated; wild animals dominate the art at the site. &nbsp;Interestingly, examination of bone refuse shows that the majority of the meat which was consumed was of wild animals, especially bulls. The excavator believes this selection in art and cuisine had to do with the contemporary era of increased domestication of animals and what is being celebrated are the animals which are part of the memory of the recent cultural past, when hunting was much more important for survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

Chinese emissaries described the kingdom as a country of gold, and perhaps they had seen its crowns adorned with shimmering gold and jade.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although their fragile gold construction initially led some to believe that these crowns were made specifically for burial, recent research has revealed that they were also used in ceremonial rites of the Silla royalty during the Three Kingdoms Period (57 B.C.E. -&nbsp;676 C.E.). Prior to the adoption of Buddhism, Koreans practiced shamanism, which is a kind of nature worship that requires the expertise of a priest-like figure, or shaman, who intercedes to alleviate problems facing the community. Silla royalty upheld shamanistic practices in ceremonial rites such as coronations and memorial services. In these sacred rituals, the gold crowns emphasized the power of the wearer through their precious materials and natural imagery.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Between the fifth and sixth centuries, Silla crowns became increasingly lavish with more ornamentation and additional, increasingly elongated branch-like protrusions. In this crown, three tree-shaped vertical elements evoke the sacred tree that once stood in the ritual precinct of Gyeongju. This sacred tree was conceived of as a &ldquo;world tree,&rdquo; or an axis mundi that connected heaven and earth. Two additional antler-shaped protrusions may refer to the reindeer that were native to the Eurasian steppe that lies to the north of the peninsula. Attached to the branch-like features of the crown are tiny gold discs and jade ornaments called <em>gogok</em>. These jade ornaments symbolize ripe fruits hanging from tree branches, representing fertility and abundance. With sunlight falling on its golden discs, the crown must have been a luminous sight indeed.</p>\n"

Although it was initially thought to be an internal component of the headband crown, mural paintings show that it was worn independently over a topknot to proclaim the rank and social status of its wearer. The cap was secured to the head with double straps under the chin, as indicated by the small holes along either side of the cap. Appendages in the shape of wings, feathers, or flowers often were used to accessorize the crown, and those ornaments tended to be geographically specific to each kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Eurasian connections</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Silla crown demonstrates cultural interactions between the Korean peninsula and the Eurasian steppe (thousands of miles&nbsp;of grassland&nbsp;that stretches&nbsp;from central Europe through Asia). Scytho-Siberian peoples of the Eurasian steppe created golden diadems similar to the Silla crown, such as a crown from Tillya Tepe&nbsp;(an archaeological site of six nomad graves that contained objects known as the &ldquo;Bactrian Hoard&rdquo;)&nbsp;&nbsp;in modern-day Afghanistan. With five tree-shaped projections, flower ornaments and reflective discs, the Tillya Tepe crown can be compared with the natural imagery and radiant gold of the Silla crown.

"<p>Though their use of gold and practice of shamanism related to the northern steppe cultures, the Silla royalty adopted the burial customs of the Chinese by burying their elite in mounded tombs. In Chinese burials, objects that were important in life were often taken to the grave. Similarly, power objects like the Silla gold crowns were used both above ground and below, and their luxurious materials conveyed the social status of the tomb occupant in the afterlife.&nbsp;</p>\n"

This gold belt, for instance, was made for the burial of a Silla king. It was like a tool belt or charm bracelet, with pendants that dangled from its band of interlinked square plates and entwining dragon openwork. Some objects were practical, such as knife sheaths and needle boxes, which evoked nomadic life on the Eurasian steppe. Others were symbolic, such as the comma-shaped ornaments seen on the Silla crown or miniature fish, which may have been charms to avert evil. The materials of the belt also corresponded to social status; for example, tombs of the Silla royalty had gold belts, while the nobility in other regions of the peninsula had silver or gilt-bronze belts.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Korea and the Silk Road</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Stretching from the Mediterranean to the Silla kingdom at the tip of the Korean peninsula, the Silk Road connected a vast terrain of ancient cultures. While the Silla kingdom shared shamanism with the Eurasian steppe and burial customs with China and Japan, the Silk Road was a main route for conveying materials, techniques, and ideas from as far away as Rome. Luxury objects in tombs of the Silla elite, such as these earrings, are made of gold and decorated with stylized foliage that resembles the Silla crown. Two tiers of leaf-shaped ornaments dangle from double loops adorned with floral motifs, continuing the imagery of the sacred world tree.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>However, a closer look at the thick, upper loop of each earring reveals the technique of granulation. Metalworking techniques, such as granulation (a&nbsp;technique whereby a surface is covered in spherules or granules of precious metal)&nbsp;and filigree&mdash;seen in the Mediterranean&mdash;appear to have traveled along the Silk Road. Silla tombs also contained other objects, such as Roman glass bowls and ewers, which reveal the extent to which luxury materials traveled via the Silk Road. These prized imports clearly inspired new forms of Korean-made luxury goods for use in both life and death.</p>\n"

In the fifth and sixth centuries, the Korean peninsula was divided between three rivaling kingdoms. The most powerful of these was the Silla kingdom in the southeast&nbsp;of the peninsula. Chinese emissaries described the kingdom as a country of gold, and perhaps they had seen its crowns adorned with shimmering gold and jade.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although their fragile gold construction initially led some to believe that these crowns were made specifically for burial, recent research has revealed that they were also used in ceremonial rites of the Silla royalty during the Three Kingdoms Period (57 B.C.E. -&nbsp;676 C.E.). Prior to the adoption of Buddhism, Koreans practiced shamanism, which is a kind of nature worship that requires the expertise of a priest-like figure, or shaman, who intercedes to alleviate problems facing the community. Silla royalty upheld shamanistic practices in ceremonial rites such as coronations and memorial services. In these sacred rituals, the gold crowns emphasized the power of the wearer through their precious materials and natural imagery.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Between the fifth and sixth centuries, Silla crowns became increasingly lavish with more ornamentation and additional, increasingly elongated branch-like protrusions. In this crown, three tree-shaped vertical elements evoke the sacred tree that once stood in the ritual precinct of Gyeongju. This sacred tree was conceived of as a &ldquo;world tree,&rdquo; or an axis mundi that connected heaven and earth. Two additional antler-shaped protrusions may refer to the reindeer that were native to the Eurasian steppe that lies to the north of the peninsula. Attached to the branch-like features of the crown are tiny gold discs and jade ornaments called <em>gogok</em>. These jade ornaments symbolize ripe fruits hanging from tree branches, representing fertility and abundance. With sunlight falling on its golden discs, the crown must have been a luminous sight indeed.</p>\n"

Although it was initially thought to be an internal component of the headband crown, mural paintings show that it was worn independently over a topknot to proclaim the rank and social status of its wearer. The cap was secured to the head with double straps under the chin, as indicated by the small holes along either side of the cap. Appendages in the shape of wings, feathers, or flowers often were used to accessorize the crown, and those ornaments tended to be geographically specific to each kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Eurasian connections</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Silla crown demonstrates cultural interactions between the Korean peninsula and the Eurasian steppe (thousands of miles&nbsp;of grassland&nbsp;that stretches&nbsp;from central Europe through Asia). Scytho-Siberian peoples of the Eurasian steppe created golden diadems similar to the Silla crown, such as a crown from Tillya Tepe&nbsp;(an archaeological site of six nomad graves that contained objects known as the &ldquo;Bactrian Hoard&rdquo;)&nbsp;&nbsp;in modern-day Afghanistan. With five tree-shaped projections, flower ornaments and reflective discs, the Tillya Tepe crown can be compared with the natural imagery and radiant gold of the Silla crown. Though separated by many miles and by centuries, both crowns attest to shamanic beliefs prevalent among the nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppe.&nbsp;</p>\n"

A feast to the eye, the object is filled with drawings and paintings that were meant to show scribes and illuminators how to decorate letters, paint initials, or add large segments of decoration to the page. Within this tradition, two types of model books can roughly be distinguished. Some functioned as instruction manuals. In these books, the drawings might be accompanied by a narrative or explanation that instructs the artisan how to proceed, usually in a step-by-step process. Other model books appear to have merely functioned as a source of inspiration: they present a wide array of shapes and drawings from which the artisan could take his pick.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The level of sophistication among surviving model books varies considerably. On the lower end of the spectrum there are pattern books that merely show how to make enlarged letters with some minor flourishing. On the higher end, by contrast, there are copies with high-quality stand-alone designs and sophisticated historiated initials inhabited by figures and scenes. Evidently the requirements of the artisans varied; and by proxy, so did the taste of medieval readers. It is this variation that makes model books so fascinating, both as physical objects and as cultural artifacts.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>To start at the lower end of the spectrum, some model books merely showed scribes how to execute a certain script or how to draw plain enlarged capitals&mdash;the most basic kind of decoration. The book opening seen above&nbsp;is from Gregorius Bock&rsquo;s Scribal Pattern Book, which provides instruction on both fronts (<a href=\"http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3593605\">more about the manuscript here</a>). Produced in 1510-1517, the first part of the small parchment book contains a series of alphabets in different scripts, some of which are clearly influenced by print typefaces. The second part contains decorative initials arranged in alphabetical order. In the introduction to his manual, Gregorius adds a dedication to his cousin Heinrich Lercher Wyss of Stuttgart, who was scribe to the Duke of W&uuml;rttemberg. The arrangement of the material shows how Heinrich likely used the book: he would thumb through its pages until he had reached either an alphabet or capital letter to his liking.</p>\n"

More complex&mdash;but still relatively plain&mdash;are the models provided by a much older pattern book in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. This appears to be the oldest surviving pattern book for initials: it dates from c. 1150 and was produced and used in a Tuscan workshop. The choice is much more limited than in the previous example: the Cambridge copy does not provide multiple alphabets, nor does it present a wide range of initials (in fact, only about twenty are present). Interestingly, some manuscripts survive in which we encounter decorated letters that could well be modeled from this or a similar model book (like <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=6386&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=7183\">British Library, Harley MS 7183</a>).</p>\n"

"<p>On the more upscale end of things is the model book known as the Macclesfield Alphabet Book. It was made and used in fifteenth-century England, apparently for the transmission of ideas to decorators or their assistants. The artisans were offered quite a lot of choice, given that we encounter no less than fourteen different alphabets on its pages. What makes this book so special, however, is their quality and the manner in which the letters are designed: their shapes are produced by human figures in various uncomfortable positions&mdash;doing yoga exercises, it seems.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Even more sophisticated are model books that show how to create elaborate decoration that runs in the margin along the length of the page. These border decorations, with their curly leaves and unexpected turns, could be tricky to produce. The so-called G&ouml;ttingen Model Book, made around 1450, provides a solution to this problem. Its pages not only show, step by step, how to build a 3D leaf pattern, they also present detailed instructions like the following:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>The foliage one shall first draw with a lead or a point. Then one shall outline the foliage with a pen and with very thin ink or with thin black color. Then one shall polish the foliage with a tooth, so that the color can be applied smoothly, but not too firmly. Then one shall paint it with the colors, one side right and the other side left or reversed, with a brush, namely light red and green. [...] (<a href=\"http://www.gutenbergdigital.de/gudi/eframes/mubu/mubufset.htm\">source</a>)</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The drawings and narrative clearly complement one another. From time to time the instructions mention something like &ldquo;as it is shown here&rdquo; or &ldquo;as the image shows.&rdquo;&nbsp;A model book can hardly be clearer than this: while the alphabet books shown above were more or less meant to simply inspire the artist, the G&ouml;ttingen book really takes the artist by the hand and guides him through each step of the production process. The instructions apparently worked well, as is shown by a surviving Gutenburg Bible that contains these very leafy borders (see above&nbsp;right).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The final point</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Models are crucial in any learning process. Observing how something is done helps you acquire a skill you lack as much as it encourages you to develop further those you already have. Moreover, there is an additional use to these pattern books that has not yet been mentioned:&nbsp;patrons visiting artisans&rsquo; shops could well have been given these objects to find out what the book-maker was capable of providing.

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Initial letter &quot;T,&quot; Gregorius Bock, Medieval Scribal Pattern Book, 1510-1517, Yale, Beinecke Library, MS 439, fols. 30v-31r \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d9472f6460725932fd24ad465bcc8f3a651ee1fc.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Initial letter T,&nbsp;Gregorius Bock, Medieval Scribal Pattern Book, 1510-1517, Yale, Beinecke Library, MS 439, fol.&nbsp;48r</span></span>This essay is devoted to a particularly attractive and rare kind of medieval manuscript: the model book. A feast to the eye, the object is filled with drawings and paintings that were meant to show scribes and illuminators how to decorate letters, paint initials, or add large segments of decoration to the page. Within this tradition, two types of model books can roughly be distinguished. Some functioned as instruction manuals. In these books, the drawings might be accompanied by a narrative or explanation that instructs the artisan how to proceed, usually in a step-by-step process. Other model books appear to have merely functioned as a source of inspiration: they present a wide array of shapes and drawings from which the artisan could take his pick.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The level of sophistication among surviving model books varies considerably. On the lower end of the spectrum there are pattern books that merely show how to make enlarged letters with some minor flourishing. On the higher end, by contrast, there are copies with high-quality stand-alone designs and sophisticated historiated initials inhabited by figures and scenes. Evidently the requirements of the artisans varied; and by proxy, so did the taste of medieval readers. It is this variation that makes model books so fascinating, both as physical objects and as cultural artifacts.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Gregorius Bock, Medieval Scribal Pattern Book, 1510-1517, Yale, Beinecke Library, MS 439, fols. 30v-31r \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/14870420613bc648360e00fe0151641f2ac6f0c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Gregorius Bock, Medieval Scribal Pattern Book, 1510-1517, Yale, Beinecke Library, MS 439, fols. 30v-31r</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To start at the lower end of the spectrum, some model books merely showed scribes how to execute a certain script or how to draw plain enlarged capitals&mdash;the most basic kind of decoration. The book opening seen above&nbsp;is from Gregorius Bock&rsquo;s Scribal Pattern Book, which provides instruction on both fronts (<a href=\"http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3593605\">more about the manuscript here</a>). Produced in 1510-1517, the first part of the small parchment book contains a series of alphabets in different scripts, some of which are clearly influenced by print typefaces. The second part contains decorative initials arranged in alphabetical order. In the introduction to his manual, Gregorius adds a dedication to his cousin Heinrich Lercher Wyss of Stuttgart, who was scribe to the Duke of W&uuml;rttemberg. The arrangement of the material shows how Heinrich likely used the book: he would thumb through its pages until he had reached either an alphabet or capital letter to his liking.</p>\n"

More complex&mdash;but still relatively plain&mdash;are the models provided by a much older pattern book in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. This appears to be the oldest surviving pattern book for initials: it dates from c. 1150 and was produced and used in a Tuscan workshop. The choice is much more limited than in the previous example: the Cambridge copy does not provide multiple alphabets, nor does it present a wide range of initials (in fact, only about twenty are present). Interestingly, some manuscripts survive in which we encounter decorated letters that could well be modeled from this or a similar model book (like <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=6386&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=7183\">British Library, Harley MS 7183</a>).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>On the more upscale end of things is the model book known as the Macclesfield Alphabet Book. It was made and used in fifteenth-century England, apparently for the transmission of ideas to decorators or their assistants. The artisans were offered quite a lot of choice, given that we encounter no less than fourteen different alphabets on its pages. What makes this book so special, however, is their quality and the manner in which the letters are designed: their shapes are produced by human figures in various uncomfortable positions&mdash;doing yoga exercises, it seems.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Even more sophisticated are model books that show how to create elaborate decoration that runs in the margin along the length of the page. These border decorations, with their curly leaves and unexpected turns, could be tricky to produce. The so-called G&ouml;ttingen Model Book, made around 1450, provides a solution to this problem. Its pages not only show, step by step, how to build a 3D leaf pattern, they also present detailed instructions like the following:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>The foliage one shall first draw with a lead or a point. Then one shall outline the foliage with a pen and with very thin ink or with thin black color. Then one shall polish the foliage with a tooth, so that the color can be applied smoothly, but not too firmly. Then one shall paint it with the colors, one side right and the other side left or reversed, with a brush, namely light red and green. [...] (<a href=\"http://www.gutenbergdigital.de/gudi/eframes/mubu/mubufset.htm\">source</a>)</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The drawings and narrative clearly complement one another. From time to time the instructions mention something like &ldquo;as it is shown here&rdquo; or &ldquo;as the image shows.&rdquo;&nbsp;A model book can hardly be clearer than this: while the alphabet books shown above were more or less meant to simply inspire the artist, the G&ouml;ttingen book really takes the artist by the hand and guides him through each step of the production process. The instructions apparently worked well, as is shown by a surviving Gutenburg Bible that contains these very leafy borders (see above&nbsp;right).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The final point</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Models are crucial in any learning process. Observing how something is done helps you acquire a skill you lack as much as it encourages you to develop further those you already have. Moreover, there is an additional use to these pattern books that has not yet been mentioned:&nbsp;patrons visiting artisans&rsquo; shops could well have been given these objects to find out what the book-maker was capable of providing.

"<p>When the British tried to expand their own trade in&nbsp;the 19th century, the Benin people killed their envoys. So in 1897 the&nbsp;British sent an armed expedition which captured the king of Benin,&nbsp;destroyed his palace and took away large quantities of sculpture and&nbsp;regalia, including works in wood, ivory and especially brass.

"\n"
"<h3><span>A sacred object out of context</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The art of medieval India, like the art of medieval Europe, was primarily in the service of religion. The devotee&rsquo;s spiritual experience was enhanced by meditation inspired by works of art and architecture. Just as the luminous upper chapel of the Sainte Chapelle dazzled and overwhelmed worshipers in France, the looming bronze statues of Shiva and Parvati in, for example, the inner halls of the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, in south India would have awed a Hindu devotee.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Its important to keep in mind that the bronze <em>Shiva as Lord of the Dance</em> (&ldquo;Nataraja&rdquo;&mdash;nata meaning dance or performance, and raja meaning king or lord), is a sacred object that has been taken out of its original context&mdash;in fact, we don&#39;t even know where this particular sculpture was originally venerated. In the intimate spaces of the Florence and Herbert Irving South Asian Galleries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> is surrounded by other metal statues of Hindu gods including the Lords Vishnu, Parvati, and Hanuman. It is easy to become absorbed in the dark quiet of these galleries with its remarkable collection of divine figures, but it is important to remember that this particular statue was intended to be movable, which explains its moderate size and sizeable circular base, ideal for lifting and hoisting onto a shoulder.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Made for mobility</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the 11th century and onwards, Hindu devotees carried these statues in processional parades as priests followed chanting prayers and bestowing blessings on people gathered for this purpose. Sometimes the statues would be adorned in resplendent red and green clothes and gold jewelry to denote the glorious human form of the gods. In these processions The <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> may have had its legs wrapped with a white and red cloth, adorned with flowers, and surrounded by candles. In a religious Hindu context, the statue is the literal embodiment of the divine. When the worshiper comes before the statue and begins to pray, faith activates the divine energy inherent in the statue, and at that moment, Shiva is present.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>A bronze Shiva</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Shiva constitutes a part of a powerful triad of divine energy within the cosmos of the Hindu religion. There is Brahma, the benevolent creator of the universe; there is Vishnu, the sagacious preserver; then there is Shiva, the destroyer. &ldquo;Destroyer&rdquo; in this sense is not an entirely negative force, but one that is expansive in its impact. In Hindu religious philosophy all things must come to a natural end so they can begin anew, and Shiva is the agent that brings about this end so that a new cycle can begin.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Metropolitan Museum&#39;s <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> was made some time in the eleventh century during the Chola Dynasty (9th-13th centuries C.E.) in south India, in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu. One of the longest lasting empires of south India, the Chola Dynasty heralded a golden age of exploration, trade, and artistic development. A great area innovation within the arts of the Chola period was in the field of metalwork, particularly in bronze sculpture. The expanse of the Chola empire stretched south-east towards Sri Lanka and gave the kingdom access to vast copper reserves that enabled the proliferation of bronze work by skilled artisans.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During this period a new kind of sculpture is made, one that combines the expressive qualities of stone temple carvings with the rich iconography possible in bronze casting. This image of Shiva is taken from the ancient Indian manual of visual depiction, the <em>Shilpa Shastras</em> (The Science or Rules of Sculpture), which contained a precise set of measurements and shapes for the limbs and proportions of the divine figure. Arms were to be long like stalks of bamboo, faces round like the moon, and eyes shaped like almonds or the leaves of a lotus. The <em>Shastras </em>were a primer on the ideals of beauty and physical perfection within ancient Hindu ideology.</p>\n"

Throughout this entire process of chaos and renewal, the face of the god remains tranquil, transfixed in what the historian of South Asian art Heinrich Zimmer calls, &ldquo;the mask of god&rsquo;s eternal essence.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Beyond grace there is perfection</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The supple and expressive quality of the dancing Shiva is one of the touchstones of South Asian, and indeed, world sculpture. When the French sculptor Auguste Rodin saw some photographs of the 11th century bronze <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> in the Madras Museum around 1915, he wrote that it seemed to him the &ldquo;perfect expression of rhythmic movement in the world.&rdquo; In an essay he wrote that was published in 1921 he wrote that the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> has &ldquo;what many people cannot see&mdash;the unknown depths, the core of life. There is grace in elegance, but beyond grace there is perfection.&rdquo; The English philosopher Aldous Huxley said in an interview in 1961 that the Hindu image of god as a dancer is unlike anything he had seen in Western art. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything that approaches the symbolism of this work of art, which is both cosmic and psychological.&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The eloquent bronze statue of the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em>, despite the impact of its formal beauty on Rodin who knew little of its background, is incomplete without an understanding of its symbolism and religious significance. Bronzes of the Chola period such as <em>Shiva as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja)</em> arose out of a need to transmute the divine into a physical embodiment of beauty.</p>\n"

"<h3>Beyond grace there is perfection</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The supple and expressive quality of the dancing Shiva is one of the touchstones of South Asian, and indeed, world sculpture. When the French sculptor Auguste Rodin saw some photographs of the 11th century bronze <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> in the Madras Museum around 1915, he wrote that it seemed to him the &ldquo;perfect expression of rhythmic movement in the world.&rdquo; In an essay he wrote that was published in 1921 he wrote that the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> has &ldquo;what many people cannot see&mdash;the unknown depths, the core of life. There is grace in elegance, but beyond grace there is perfection.&rdquo; The English philosopher Aldous Huxley said in an interview in 1961 that the Hindu image of god as a dancer is unlike anything he had seen in Western art. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything that approaches the symbolism of this work of art, which is both cosmic and psychological.&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The eloquent bronze statue of the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em>, despite the impact of its formal beauty on Rodin who knew little of its background, is incomplete without an understanding of its symbolism and religious significance. Bronzes of the Chola period such as <em>Shiva as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja)</em> arose out of a need to transmute the divine into a physical embodiment of beauty.</p>\n"

"<p>Born Maria Antonia Montoya, Maria Martinez became one of the best-known Native potters of the twentieth century due to her excellence as a ceramist and her connections with a larger, predominantly non-Native audience. Though she lived at the Pueblo of San Ildefonso, about 20 miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, from her birth in 1887 until her death in 1980, her work and her life had a wide reaching importance to the Native art world by reframing Native ceramics as a fine art. Before the arrival of the railroad to the area in the 1880s, pots were used in the Pueblos for food storage, cooking, and ceremonies. But with inexpensive pots appearing along the rail line, these practices were in decline. By the 1910s, Ms. Martinez found a way to continue the art by selling her pots to a non-Native audience where they were purchased as something beautiful to look at rather than as utilitarian objects.</p>\n"

"<p><span>Her mastery as a ceramist was noted in her village while she was still young. She learned the ceramic techniques that were used in the Southwest for several millennia by watching potters from San Ildefonso, especially her aunt Nicholasa as well as potters (including Margaret Tafoya from Santa Clara), from other nearby Pueblos. All the raw materials had to be gathered and processed carefully or the final vessel would not fire properly. The clay was found locally. To make the pottery stronger it had to be mixed with a temper made from sherds of broken pots that had been pounded into a powder or volcanic ash. When mixed with water, the elasticity of the clay and the strength of the temper could be formed into different shapes, including a rounded pot (known as an <em>olla</em>) or a flat plate, using only the artist&rsquo;s hands as the potting wheel was not used. The dried vessel needed to be scraped, sanded, smoothed, then covered with a slip (a thin solution of clay and water). The slip was polished by rubbing a smooth stone over the surface to flatten the clay and create a shiny finish&mdash;a difficult and time-consuming process. Over the polished slip the pot was covered with designs painted with an iron-rich solution using either pulverized iron ore or a reduction of wild plants called guaco. These would be dried but required a high temperature firing to change the brittle clay to hard ceramics. Even without kilns, the ceramists were able to create a fire hot enough to transform the pot by using manure.</span></p>\n"

"<p>Maria and Julian Martinez pioneered a style of applying a matte-black design over polished-black. Similar to the pot pictured here, the design was based on pottery sherds found on an Ancestral Pueblo dig site dating to the twelfth to seventeenth centuries at what is now known as Bandelier National Monument. The Martinezes worked at the site, with Julian helping the archaeologists at the dig and Maria helping at the campsite. Julian Martinez spent time drawing and painting the designs found on the walls and on the sherds of pottery into his notebooks, designs he later recreated on pots. In the 1910s, Maria and Julian worked together to recreate the black-on-black ware they found at the dig, experimenting with clay from different areas and using different firing techniques. Taking a cue from Santa Clara pots, they discovered that smothering the fire with powdered manure removed the oxygen while retaining the heat and resulted in a pot that was blackened. This resulted in a pot that was less hard and not entirely watertight, which worked for the new market that prized decorative use over utilitarian value. The areas that were burnished had a shiny black surface and the areas painted with guaco were matte designs based on natural phenomenon, such as rain clouds, bird feathers, rows of planted corn, and the flow of rivers.</p>\n"

"<p>Charlemagne, King of the Franks and later Holy Roman Emperor, instigated a cultural revival known as the Carolingian Renaissance. This revival used Constantine&#39;s Christian empire as its model, which flourished between 306 and 337. Constantine was the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity and left behind an impressive legacy of military strength and artistic patronage.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Charlemagne saw himself as the new Constantine and instigated this revival by writing his&nbsp;Admonitio generalis&nbsp;(789) and&nbsp;Epistola de litteris colendis&nbsp;(c.794-797). In the&nbsp;Admonitio generalis, Charlemagne legislates church reform, which he believes will make his subjects more moral and in the&nbsp;Epistola de litteris colendis, a letter to Abbot Baugulf of Fulda, he outlines his intentions for cultural reform. Most importantly, he invited the greatest scholars from all over Europe to come to court and give advice for his renewal of politics, church, art and literature.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Carolingian art survives in manuscripts, sculpture, architecture and other religious artifacts produced during the period 780-900. These artists worked exclusively for the emperor, members of his court, and the bishops and abbots associated with the court. Geographically, the revival extended through present-day France, Switzerland, Germany and Austria.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Charlemagne commissioned the architect Odo of Metz to construct a palace and chapel in Aachen, Germany. The chapel was consecrated in 805 and is known as the Palatine Chapel. This space served as the seat of Charlemagne&#39;s power and still houses his throne today.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Palatine Chapel is octagonal with a dome, recalling the shape of San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy (completed in 548), but was built with barrel and groin vaults, which are distinctively late Roman methods of construction. The chapel is perhaps the best surviving example of Carolingian architecture and probably influenced the design of later European palace chapels.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Charlemagne had his own scriptorium, or center for copying and illuminating manuscripts, at Aachen. Under the direction of Alcuin of York, this scriptorium produced a new script known as Carolingian miniscule. Prior to this development, writing styles or scripts in Europe were localized and difficult to read. A book written in one part of Europe could not be easily read in another, even when the scribe and reader were both fluent in Latin. Knowledge of Carolingian miniscule spread from Aachen was universally adopted, allowing for clearer written communication within Charlemagne&#39;s empire. Carolingian miniscule was the most widely used script in Europe for about 400 years.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Figurative art from this period is easy to recognize. Unlike the flat, two-dimensional work of Early Christian and Early Byzantine artists, Carolingian artists sought to restore the third dimension. They used classical drawings as their models and tried to create more convincing illusions of space.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>This development is evident in tracing author portraits in illuminated manuscripts. The Godescalc Gospel Lectionary, commisioned by Charlemagne and his wife Hildegard, was made circa 781-83 during his reign as King of the Franks and before the beginning of the Carolingian Renaissance. In the portrait of St. Mark, the artist employs typical Early Byzantine artistic conventions. The face is heavily modeled in brown, the drapery folds fall in stylized patterns and there is little or no shading. The seated position of the evangelist would be difficult to reproduce in real life, as there are spatial inconsistencies. The left leg is shown in profile and the other leg is show straight on.

"<p>Charlemagne, King of the Franks and later Holy Roman Emperor, instigated a cultural revival known as the Carolingian Renaissance. This revival used Constantine&#39;s Christian empire as its model, which flourished between 306 and 337. Constantine was the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity and left behind an impressive legacy of military strength and artistic patronage.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Charlemagne saw himself as the new Constantine and instigated this revival by writing his&nbsp;Admonitio generalis&nbsp;(789) and&nbsp;Epistola de litteris colendis&nbsp;(c.794-797). In the&nbsp;Admonitio generalis, Charlemagne legislates church reform, which he believes will make his subjects more moral and in the&nbsp;Epistola de litteris colendis, a letter to Abbot Baugulf of Fulda, he outlines his intentions for cultural reform. Most importantly, he invited the greatest scholars from all over Europe to come to court and give advice for his renewal of politics, church, art and literature.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Carolingian art survives in manuscripts, sculpture, architecture and other religious artifacts produced during the period 780-900. These artists worked exclusively for the emperor, members of his court, and the bishops and abbots associated with the court. Geographically, the revival extended through present-day France, Switzerland, Germany and Austria.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Charlemagne commissioned the architect Odo of Metz to construct a palace and chapel in Aachen, Germany. The chapel was consecrated in 805 and is known as the Palatine Chapel. This space served as the seat of Charlemagne&#39;s power and still houses his throne today.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Palatine Chapel is octagonal with a dome, recalling the shape of San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy (completed in 548), but was built with barrel and groin vaults, which are distinctively late Roman methods of construction. The chapel is perhaps the best surviving example of Carolingian architecture and probably influenced the design of later European palace chapels.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Charlemagne had his own scriptorium, or center for copying and illuminating manuscripts, at Aachen. Under the direction of Alcuin of York, this scriptorium produced a new script known as Carolingian miniscule. Prior to this development, writing styles or scripts in Europe were localized and difficult to read. A book written in one part of Europe could not be easily read in another, even when the scribe and reader were both fluent in Latin. Knowledge of Carolingian miniscule spread from Aachen was universally adopted, allowing for clearer written communication within Charlemagne&#39;s empire. Carolingian miniscule was the most widely used script in Europe for about 400 years.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Figurative art from this period is easy to recognize. Unlike the flat, two-dimensional work of Early Christian and Early Byzantine artists, Carolingian artists sought to restore the third dimension. They used classical drawings as their models and tried to create more convincing illusions of space.</p>\n"

The&nbsp;Godescalc Gospel Lectionary,&nbsp;commisioned by Charlemagne and his wife Hildegard, was made circa 781-83 during his reign as King of the Franks and before the beginning of the Carolingian Renaissance. In the portrait of St. Mark, the artist employs typical Early Byzantine artistic conventions. The face is heavily modeled in brown, the drapery folds fall in stylized patterns and there is little or no shading. The seated position of the evangelist would be difficult to reproduce in real life, as there are spatial inconsistencies. The left leg is shown in profile and the other leg is show straight on.

"<p>For most of us, architecture is easy to take for granted. Its everywhere in our daily lives&mdash;sometimes elegant, other times shabby, but generally ubiquitous. How often do we stop to examine and contemplate its form and style? Stopping for that contemplation offers not only the opportunity to understand one&rsquo;s daily surroundings, but also to appreciate the connection that exists between architectural forms in our own time and those from the past. Architectural tradition and design has the ability to link disparate cultures together over time and space&mdash;and this is certainly true of the legacy of architectural forms created by the ancient Greeks.</p>\n"

"<h3>Temple</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most recognizably &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; structure is the temple (even though the architecture of Greek temples is actually quite&nbsp;diverse). The Greeks referred to temples with the term ὁ &nu;&alpha;ό&sigmaf; (<em>ho na&oacute;s</em>) meaning &quot;dwelling;&quot;&nbsp;temple derives from the Latin term, <em>templum</em>. The earliest shrines were built to honor divinities and were made from&nbsp;materials such as a wood and mud brick&mdash;materials&nbsp;that typically don&#39;t survive very long. The basic form of the<em> naos</em> emerges as early as the tenth century B.C.E. as a simple, rectangular room with projecting walls (<em>antae</em>) that created a shallow porch. This basic form remained unchanged in its concept for centuries. In the eighth century B.C.E.&nbsp;Greek architecture begins&nbsp;to make the move from ephemeral materials (wood, mud brick, thatch) to permanent materials (namely, stone).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Archaic period the tenets of the Doric order of architecture in the Greek mainland became firmly established, leading to a wave of monumental temple building during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. Greek city-states invested substantial resources in temple building&mdash;as they competed with each other not just in strategic and economic terms, but also in their architecture. For example, Athens devoted enormous resources to the construction of the&nbsp;acropolis in the 5th century B.C.E.&mdash;in part so that Athenians could be confident&nbsp;that the temples built to honor their gods surpassed anything that their rival states could offer.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The multi-phase architectural development of sanctuaries such as that of Hera on the island of Samos demonstrate not only the change that occurred in construction techniques over time but also&nbsp;how the Greeks&nbsp;re-used&nbsp;sacred spaces&mdash;with the later phases built directly atop the preceding ones. Perhaps the fullest, and most famous, expression of Classical Greek temple architecture is the Periclean Parthenon of Athens&mdash;a Doric order structure, the Parthenon represents the maturity of the Greek classical form.</p>\n"

"Greek temples are often categorized in terms of their ground plan and the way in which the columns are arranged. A prostyle temple is a temple that has columns only at the front, while an amphiprostyle temple has columns at the front and the rear. Temples with a peripteral arrangement (from the Greek &pi;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu; (<em>pteron</em>) meaning &quot;wing) have a single line of columns arranged all around the exterior of the temple building. Dipteral temples simply have a double row of columns surrounding the building. One of the more unusual plans is the tholos, a temple with a circular ground plan; famous examples are attested at the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi and the sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidauros.</p>\n"

"<p>Stoa (&sigma;&tau;&omicron;ά) is a Greek architectural term that describes a covered walkway or colonnade that was usually designed for public use.

These later examples allowed interior space for shops or other rooms and often incorporated the Ionic order for interior colonnades.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Greek city planners came to prefer the stoa as a device for framing the agora (public market place) of a city or town. The South Stoa constructed as part of the sanctuary of Hera on the island of Samos (c. 700-550 B.C.E.) numbers among the earliest examples of the stoa in Greek architecture. Many cities, particularly Athens and Corinth, came to have elaborate and famous stoas. In Athens the famous Stoa Poikile (&ldquo;Painted Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., housed paintings of famous Greek military exploits including the battle of Marathon, while the Stoa Basileios (&ldquo;Royal Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., was the seat of a chief civic official (<em>archon basileios</em>).</p>\n"

At Corinth the stoa persisted as an architectural type well into the Roman period; the South Stoa there (above), c. 150 C.E., shows the continued utility of this building design for framing civic space. From the Hellenistic period onwards the stoa also lent its name to a philosophical school, as Zeno of Citium (c. 334-262 B.C.E.) originally taught his Stoic philosophy in the Stoa Poikile of Athens.</p>\n"

Theaters often took advantage of hillsides and naturally sloping terrain and, in general, utilized the panoramic landscape as the backdrop to the stage itself. The Greek theater is composed of the seating area (theatron), a circular space for the chorus to perform (orchestra), and the stage (<em>skene</em>). Tiered seats in the theatron provided space for spectators. Two side aisles (<em>parados</em>, pl. <em>paradoi</em>) provided access to the orchestra. The Greek theater inspired the Roman version of the theater directly, although the Romans introduced some modifications to the concept of theater architecture. In many cases the Romans converted pre-existing Greek theaters to conform to their own architectural ideals, as is evident in the Theater of Dionysos on the slopes of the Athenian Acropolis. Since theatrical performances were often linked to sacred festivals, it is not uncommon to find theaters associated directly with sanctuaries.</p>\n"

"<p>The Bouleuterion (&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&tau;ή&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;) was an important civic building in a Greek city, as it was the meeting place of the boule (citizen council) of the city. These select representatives assembled to handle public affairs and represent the citizenry of the polis (in ancient Athens the boule was comprised of 500 members). The bouleuterion generally was a covered, rectilinear building with stepped seating surrounding a central speaker&rsquo;s well in which an altar was placed. The city of Pri&egrave;ne has a particularly well-preserved example of this civic structure as does the city of Miletus.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>House</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Greek houses of the Archaic and Classical periods were relatively simple in design. Houses usually were centered on a courtyard that would have been the scene for various ritual activities; the courtyard also provided natural light for the often small houses. The ground floor rooms would have included kitchen and storage rooms, perhaps an animal pen and a latrine; the chief room was the <em>andron&mdash;</em>site of the male-dominated drinking party (<em>symposion</em>). The quarters for women and children (<em>gynaikeion</em>) could be located on the second level (if present) and were, in any case, segregated from the mens&rsquo; area. It was not <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Plan, Olynthus (Greece), House A vii 4, built after 432 but before 348 B.C.E., from Olynthus, vol. 8 pl. 99, 100 and fig. 5 (photo: Perseus Digital Library)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/75c06bf3b223ae048bf1e30d69df4eb3e72a15c7.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plan, Olynthus (Greece), House A vii 4, built after 432,&nbsp;before 348 B.C.E., from <em>Olynthus</em>, vol. 8 pl. 99, 100 and fig. 5, kitchen complex&nbsp;c, d, and e; &nbsp;andron (k)&nbsp;(photo: Perseus Digital Library)</span></span>uncommon for houses to be attached to workshops or shops. The houses excavated in the southwest part of the Athenian Agora had walls of mud brick that rested on stone socles and tiled roofs, with floors of beaten clay.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The city of Olynthus in Chalcidice, Greece, destroyed by military action in 348 B.C.E., preserves many well-appointed courtyard houses arranged within the Hippodamian grid-plan of the city. House A vii 4&nbsp;had a large cobbled courtyard that was used for domestic industry. While some rooms were fairly plain, with earthen floors, the <em>andron</em> was the most well-appointed room of the house.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Fortifications</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Fortifications, Palairos (Greece)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ac9fa24828faa454e8f7884c04794c7be2bab7fa.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Fortifications and gate, Palairos (Greece)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Mycenaean fortifications of Bronze Age Greece (c. 1300&nbsp;B.C.E.)&nbsp;are particularly well known&mdash;the megalithic architecture (also referred to as Cyclopean because of the use of enormous stones) represents a trend in Bronze Age architecture.&nbsp;While these massive Bronze Age walls are difficult to best, first millennium B.C.E. Greece also shows evidence for stone built fortification walls. In Attika (the territory of Athens), a series of Classical and Hellenistic walls built in ashlar masonry (squared masonry blocks) have been studied as a potential system of border defenses. &nbsp;At Palairos in Epirus (Greece) the massive fortifications enclose a high citadel that occupies imposing terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Stadium, Gymnasium, and Palaestra</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Greek stadium (derived from <em>stadion</em>, a Greek measurement equivalent to c. 578 feet or 176 meters) was the location of foot races held as part of sacred games; these structures are often found in the context of sanctuaries, as in the case of &nbsp;the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Olympia and Epidauros. Long and narrow, with a horseshoe shape, the stadium occupied reasonably flat terrain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The gymnasium (from the Greek term <em>gymn&oacute;s</em> meaning &quot;naked&quot;) was a training center for athletes who participated in public games. This facility tended to include areas for both training and storage. The<em> </em>palaestra (&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;ί&sigma;&tau;&rho;&alpha;) was an exercise facility originally connected with the training of wrestlers. These complexes were generally rectilinear in plan, with a colonnade framing a central, open space.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Altar</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Altar of Hieron II \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3439d4bb1d27b21571fabf5110421aa649fc1ec5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Altar of Hieron II, 3rd century B.C.E.&nbsp;(Syracuse, Sicily, Italy)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Since blood sacrifice was a key component of Greek ritual practice, an altar was essential for these purposes. While altars did not necessarily need to be architecturalized, they could be and, in some cases, they assumed a monumental scale. The third century B.C.E. Altar of Hieron II at Syracuse, Sicily, provides one such example. At c. 196 meters in length and c. 11 m in height the massive altar was reported to be capable of hosting the simultaneous sacrifice of 450 bulls (Diodorus Siculus <em>History</em> 11.72.2).</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Model of the Pergamon Altar (Altar of Zeus), c. 200-150 B.C.E.

The altar itself is screened by a monumental enclosure decorated with sculpture; the monument measures c. 35.64 by 33.4 meters. The altar is best known for its program of relief sculpture that depict a gigantomachy (battle between the Olympian gods and the giants) that is presented as an allegory for the military conquests of the kings of Pergamon. Despite its monumental scale and lavish decoration, the Pergamon altar preserves the basic and necessary features of the Greek altar: it is frontal and approached by stairs and is open to the air&mdash;to allow not only for the blood sacrifice itself but also for the burning of the thigh bones and fat as an offering to the gods.</p>\n"

"<h3>Fountain house</h3>\n"

The Southeast Fountain house in the Athenian Agora (c. 530 B.C.E.) provides an example of this tendency to position fountain houses and their dependable supply of clean drinking water close to civic spaces like the agora. Gathering water was seen as a woman&rsquo;s task and, as such, it offered the often isolated women a chance to socialize with others while collecting water. Fountain house scenes are common on ceramic water jars (<em>hydriai</em>), as is the case for a Black-figured hydria (c. 525-500 B.C.E.) found in an Etruscan tomb in Vulci that is now in the British Museum&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Legacy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The architecture of ancient Greece influenced ancient&nbsp;Roman architecture, and became the architectural vernacular employed in the expansive Hellenistic world created in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Greek architectural forms became implanted so deeply in the Roman architectural mindset that they endured throughout antiquity, only to then be re-discovered in the Renaissance and especially from the mid-eighteenth century onwards as a feature of the Neo-Classical movement. This durable legacy helps to explain why the ancient Greek architectural orders and the tenets of Greek design are still so prevalent&mdash;and visible&mdash;in our post-modern world.</p>\n"

"<p>For most of us, architecture is easy to take for granted. Its everywhere in our daily lives&mdash;sometimes elegant, other times shabby, but generally ubiquitous. How often do we stop to examine and contemplate its form and style? Stopping for that contemplation offers not only the opportunity to understand one&rsquo;s daily surroundings, but also to appreciate the connection that exists between architectural forms in our own time and those from the past. Architectural tradition and design has the ability to link disparate cultures together over time and space&mdash;and this is certainly true of the legacy of architectural forms created by the ancient Greeks.</p>\n"

"<h3>Temple</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most recognizably &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; structure is the temple (even though the architecture of Greek temples is actually quite&nbsp;diverse). The Greeks referred to temples with the term ὁ &nu;&alpha;ό&sigmaf; (<em>ho na&oacute;s</em>) meaning &quot;dwelling;&quot;&nbsp;temple derives from the Latin term, <em>templum</em>. The earliest shrines were built to honor divinities and were made from&nbsp;materials such as a wood and mud brick&mdash;materials&nbsp;that typically don&#39;t survive very long. The basic form of the<em> naos</em> emerges as early as the tenth century B.C.E. as a simple, rectangular room with projecting walls (<em>antae</em>) that created a shallow porch. This basic form remained unchanged in its concept for centuries. In the eighth century B.C.E.&nbsp;Greek architecture begins&nbsp;to make the move from ephemeral materials (wood, mud brick, thatch) to permanent materials (namely, stone).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Archaic period the tenets of the Doric order of architecture in the Greek mainland became firmly established, leading to a wave of monumental temple building during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. Greek city-states invested substantial resources in temple building&mdash;as they competed with each other not just in strategic and economic terms, but also in their architecture. For example, Athens devoted enormous resources to the construction of the&nbsp;acropolis in the 5th century B.C.E.&mdash;in part so that Athenians could be confident&nbsp;that the temples built to honor their gods surpassed anything that their rival states could offer.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The multi-phase architectural development of sanctuaries such as that of Hera on the island of Samos demonstrate not only the change that occurred in construction techniques over time but also&nbsp;how the Greeks&nbsp;re-used&nbsp;sacred spaces&mdash;with the later phases built directly atop the preceding ones. Perhaps the fullest, and most famous, expression of Classical Greek temple architecture is the Periclean Parthenon of Athens&mdash;a Doric order structure, the Parthenon represents the maturity of the Greek classical form.</p>\n"

"Greek temples are often categorized in terms of their ground plan and the way in which the columns are arranged. A prostyle temple is a temple that has columns only at the front, while an amphiprostyle temple has columns at the front and the rear. Temples with a peripteral arrangement (from the Greek &pi;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu; (<em>pteron</em>) meaning &quot;wing) have a single line of columns arranged all around the exterior of the temple building. Dipteral temples simply have a double row of columns surrounding the building. One of the more unusual plans is the tholos, a temple with a circular ground plan; famous examples are attested at the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi and the sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidauros.</p>\n"

"<p>Stoa (&sigma;&tau;&omicron;ά) is a Greek architectural term that describes a covered walkway or colonnade that was usually designed for public use. Early examples, often employing the Doric order, were usually composed of a single level, although later examples (Hellenistic and Roman) came to be two-story freestanding structures. These later examples allowed interior space for shops or other rooms and often incorporated the Ionic order for interior colonnades.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Greek city planners came to prefer the stoa as a device for framing the agora (public market place) of a city or town. The South Stoa constructed as part of the sanctuary of Hera on the island of Samos (c. 700-550 B.C.E.) numbers among the earliest examples of the stoa in Greek architecture. Many cities, particularly Athens and Corinth, came to have elaborate and famous stoas. In Athens the famous Stoa Poikile (&ldquo;Painted Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., housed paintings of famous Greek military exploits including the battle of Marathon, while the Stoa Basileios (&ldquo;Royal Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., was the seat of a chief civic official (<em>archon basileios</em>).</p>\n"

At Corinth the stoa persisted as an architectural type well into the Roman period; the South Stoa there (above), c. 150 C.E., shows the continued utility of this building design for framing civic space. From the Hellenistic period onwards the stoa also lent its name to a philosophical school, as Zeno of Citium (c. 334-262 B.C.E.) originally taught his Stoic philosophy in the Stoa Poikile of Athens.</p>\n"

Theaters often took advantage of hillsides and naturally sloping terrain and, in general, utilized the panoramic landscape as the backdrop to the stage itself. The Greek theater is composed of the seating area (theatron), a circular space for the chorus to perform (orchestra), and the stage (<em>skene</em>). Tiered seats in the theatron provided space for spectators. Two side aisles (<em>parados</em>, pl. <em>paradoi</em>) provided access to the orchestra. The Greek theater inspired the Roman version of the theater directly, although the Romans introduced some modifications to the concept of theater architecture. In many cases the Romans converted pre-existing Greek theaters to conform to their own architectural ideals, as is evident in the Theater of Dionysos on the slopes of the Athenian Acropolis. Since theatrical performances were often linked to sacred festivals, it is not uncommon to find theaters associated directly with sanctuaries.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Mycenaean fortifications of Bronze Age Greece (c. 1300&nbsp;B.C.E.)&nbsp;are particularly well known&mdash;the megalithic architecture (also referred to as Cyclopean because of the use of enormous stones) represents a trend in Bronze Age architecture.&nbsp;While these massive Bronze Age walls are difficult to best, first millennium B.C.E. Greece also shows evidence for stone built fortification walls. In Attika (the territory of Athens), a series of Classical and Hellenistic walls built in ashlar masonry (squared masonry blocks) have been studied as a potential system of border defenses. &nbsp;At Palairos in Epirus (Greece) the massive fortifications enclose a high citadel that occupies imposing terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Stadium, Gymnasium, and Palaestra</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Greek stadium (derived from <em>stadion</em>, a Greek measurement equivalent to c. 578 feet or 176 meters) was the location of foot races held as part of sacred games; these structures are often found in the context of sanctuaries, as in the case of &nbsp;the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Olympia and Epidauros. Long and narrow, with a horseshoe shape, the stadium occupied reasonably flat terrain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The gymnasium (from the Greek term <em>gymn&oacute;s</em> meaning &quot;naked&quot;) was a training center for athletes who participated in public games. This facility tended to include areas for both training and storage. The<em> </em>palaestra (&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;ί&sigma;&tau;&rho;&alpha;) was an exercise facility originally connected with the training of wrestlers. These complexes were generally rectilinear in plan, with a colonnade framing a central, open space.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Altar</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Altar of Hieron II \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3439d4bb1d27b21571fabf5110421aa649fc1ec5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Altar of Hieron II, 3rd century B.C.E.&nbsp;(Syracuse, Sicily, Italy)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Since blood sacrifice was a key component of Greek ritual practice, an altar was essential for these purposes. While altars did not necessarily need to be architecturalized, they could be and, in some cases, they assumed a monumental scale. The third century B.C.E. Altar of Hieron II at Syracuse, Sicily, provides one such example. At c. 196 meters in length and c. 11 m in height the massive altar was reported to be capable of hosting the simultaneous sacrifice of 450 bulls (Diodorus Siculus <em>History</em> 11.72.2).</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Model of the Pergamon Altar (Altar of Zeus), c. 200-150 B.C.E.

(Pergamon Museum, Berlin)&nbsp;photo:&nbsp;Steven Zucker&nbsp;(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>Another spectacular altar is the Altar of Zeus from Pergamon, built during the first half of the second century B.C.E. The altar itself is screened by a monumental enclosure decorated with sculpture; the monument measures c. 35.64 by 33.4 meters. The altar is best known for its program of relief sculpture that depict a gigantomachy (battle between the Olympian gods and the giants) that is presented as an allegory for the military conquests of the kings of Pergamon. Despite its monumental scale and lavish decoration, the Pergamon altar preserves the basic and necessary features of the Greek altar: it is frontal and approached by stairs and is open to the air&mdash;to allow not only for the blood sacrifice itself but also for the burning of the thigh bones and fat as an offering to the gods.</p>\n"

"<h3>Fountain house</h3>\n"

The Southeast Fountain house in the Athenian Agora (c. 530 B.C.E.) provides an example of this tendency to position fountain houses and their dependable supply of clean drinking water close to civic spaces like the agora. Gathering water was seen as a woman&rsquo;s task and, as such, it offered the often isolated women a chance to socialize with others while collecting water. Fountain house scenes are common on ceramic water jars (<em>hydriai</em>), as is the case for a Black-figured hydria (c. 525-500 B.C.E.) found in an Etruscan tomb in Vulci that is now in the British Museum&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Legacy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The architecture of ancient Greece influenced ancient&nbsp;Roman architecture, and became the architectural vernacular employed in the expansive Hellenistic world created in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Greek architectural forms became implanted so deeply in the Roman architectural mindset that they endured throughout antiquity, only to then be re-discovered in the Renaissance and especially from the mid-eighteenth century onwards as a feature of the Neo-Classical movement. This durable legacy helps to explain why the ancient Greek architectural orders and the tenets of Greek design are still so prevalent&mdash;and visible&mdash;in our post-modern world.</p>\n"

"<p>How is it that the Jews, called by Scripture &ldquo;the smallest of all the nations&rdquo; (Deut. 7:7) merit a section on religious architecture placed alongside the glories of Christendom, Islam, and Buddhism? After all, the Jews today number something around fourteen million, the same number that existed before the massacre of six million in Europe and the dissolution of communities across Europe and the Arab world during the 1940s. This is a numerical highpoint. In previous centuries, the numbers were far smaller. Just on the basis of demography, then, it would be hard to justify the inclusion of Judaism in this history of art and architecture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A national style?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More difficult, perhaps, from the first century through the establishment of modern Israel in 1948 Jews could not claim (or assert, as new European nations states did) a &ldquo;national&rdquo; identity or a &ldquo;national&rdquo; style of art based upon landed nationalism&mdash;categories that were of central importance to nineteenth and twentieth century constructions of architectural history and style.

"\n"
"<p>The Temple of Solomon (c. 900 B.C.E.), modern scholars tell us, was a typical near eastern temple, while the great synagogues constructed at the turn of the twentieth century were art deco palaces.

"<p>The greatest of Jewish building, the temples of Solomon (destroyed 586&nbsp;B.C.E.) and Herod in Jerusalem (destroyed 70 C.E.) are long gone, and never again have Jews controlled extensive resources for building, nor land for construction.

Small Jewish communities, stretched across the world from late antique Palestine to Kaifeng in 17th century China to contemporary America and Israel built synagogues&mdash;often buildings of great beauty and historical significance, but mostly pretty limited from an architectural standpoint. There were no Jewish benefactors to compete with Justinian or Saladin or the della Rovere; and virtually no government sponsorship of magnificent synagogues. Jewish architecture is always derivative of local styles and patterns, and responds to the needs of local minority communities. It never drove those styles.

"<h3>Longevity</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What Jews lacked in territory, wealth and numbers, they made up for in longevity. Jews&mdash;short for &ldquo;the Judeans,&rdquo; trace their cultural heritage, and sometimes their physical lineage, to the biblical patriarchs&mdash;Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (also called Israel) and to the land of Israel (called in Roman times Judaea)&mdash;an unbroken chain of 3000 years. This is not just an &ldquo;imagined&rdquo; history. No other western community can assert&mdash;based upon rich documentary and physical evidence&mdash;to have encountered both Cyrus the Great and Innocent III, Caligula and Mohammed, Victoria, Stalin and Rembrandt. Though a minority, Jews maintained rich mimetic traditions across the empires that make up the &ldquo;Western world,&rdquo; and an astonishingly complex book culture that has sustained their sense of group cohesion. From antiquity to modern times, it was (and in many ways, still is) possible to travel from Jewish community to Jewish community from Persia to Spain and beyond&mdash;as travelers did&mdash;and find Jews who shared an all encompassing religious culture&mdash;even if they ate &ldquo;strange&rdquo; (though always&nbsp;kosher) foods, dressed &ldquo;funny&rdquo; (though males still wore the biblically mandated ritual &ldquo;fringes&rdquo;) and practiced &ldquo;strange&rdquo; local liturgical customs. Not speaking the same vernacular language, a visitor from, say, Germany might have communicated with his hosts in, say, Egypt, by drawing upon mix of &ldquo;peculiarly pronounced&rdquo; Hebrew and Aramaic gained through exposure to vast quantities of canonical religious texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Jews and their texts&mdash;not always together&mdash;have been active in what some textbooks still call &ldquo;the Western Experience&rdquo; from its beginning. The religious traditions associated with Jesus and Mohammed both assert that Jewish scripture, and interaction with Jews, is essential their own revelations, both of which assert relationship by virtue of having &quot;superseded&rdquo; the revelation of Moses. In other words, Jews &ldquo;matter&rdquo; to Christians and to Muslims, and by virtue of living among them, Christians and Muslims &ldquo;mattered&rdquo; to Jews.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The study of Jewish art and architecture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The academic study of Jewish architecture developed from the eighteenth century onward, when Christian Hebraists and bible scholars developed interests in biblical architecture&mdash;the Mosaic Tabernacle, the Solomonic Temple and the Herodian Temple&mdash;the latter visited by Jesus, who according to the Gospels predicted its destruction in 70 C.E. under emperor Vespasian. Post-&ldquo;biblical&rdquo; Jewish architecture did not become a focus of research until discoveries by the Palestine Exploration Fund of late antique synagogues during the 1860s. Medieval and early modern buildings took a bit longer to occasion scholarly interest. Jews in 19th century Europe, America and to some degree Islamic lands and south Asia, were engaged in a full-scale building boom; the largest since Herod the Great&rsquo;s rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple beginning 20/19 B.C.E. Newly emancipated and emancipating communities asserted their presence by building huge synagogues, experimenting with a wide range of forms, from neo-Egyptian to neo-classical and neo-moresque, eventually settling upon the modern yet traditionalist tones of art deco.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Only at the end of the 19th century did scholars begin to look back and study &ldquo;Jewish art,&rdquo; including Jewish architecture; often looking&mdash;whether intentionally or not&mdash;for roots for the contemporary boom in earlier periods. Hoping to prove that &ldquo;Jews do art too,&rdquo; Jews of all stripes hoped to prove their humanity through the creation and study of Jewish art. It was only in post-war New York that the first&mdash;and perhaps still the best&mdash;comprehensive surveys of Jewish religious architecture were written, both by art historian/architect Rachel Wischnitzer. These were entitled <em>European Synagogue Architecture</em> and <em>Synagogue Architecture in America</em>.&nbsp;By then, the State of Israel had been established, and &ldquo;Jewish art&rdquo;&mdash;including architecture&mdash;became the national art.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The canonical book of this process was Cecil Roth&rsquo;s <em>Jewish Art: An Illustrated History</em>, first published in Hebrew in 1958 and still in print in Hebrew. This anthology brought together scholars who had been scattered throughout the world due to the War to present a comprehensive history, from Solomon to the present. Architecture&mdash;until the modern period, all of it &ldquo;religious&rdquo; appears in every period and in almost every article, with some articles dedicated to this subject. The study of Jewish architecture has been of particular interest to Israeli scholars, but also to Americans and Europeans, and the Hebrew University&rsquo;s Center for Jewish Art has sent teams across the world to document historical synagogues&mdash;most no longer used. In Europe, this work takes on additional significance, as it has been spawned by a real interest to regain a now-lost heritage&mdash;particularly in the East, as Europe, particularly since the fall of Communism, has sought to develop a more tolerant European tradition and usable history.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In recent years, Jewish visual culture has been deeply assimilated into the academic study of Judaism, really for the first time. Cultural historians, working with art historians and architectural historians, have begun to focus upon the very elements of Jewish &ldquo;minority&rdquo; architecture that in previous generations were often spurned. The process by which a small minority group melded with its general environment, transforming and being transformed within that environment has become the stuff of contemporary scholarship. In many ways, the Jews have been the &ldquo;canary in the coal mine,&rdquo; the test case for theoretical discussion of what it means to live in diaspora and to be Europe&#39;s first, earliest and most intimate&mdash;colonized people.</p>\n"

"<p>Imperial Chinese history is marked by the rise and fall of many dynasties and occasional periods of disunity, but overall the age was remarkably stable and marked by a sophisticated governing system that included the concept of a meritocracy. Each dynasty had its own distinct characteristics and in many eras encounters with foreign cultural and political influences through territorial expansion and waves of immigration also brought new stimulus to China. China was a highly literate society that greatly valued poetry and brush-written calligraphy, which along with painting, were called the Three Perfections, reflecting the esteemed position of the arts in Chinese life.&nbsp;Imperial China produced many technological advancements that have enriched the world, including paper and porcelain.</p>\n"

"<p>Imperial Chinese history is marked by the rise and fall of many dynasties and occasional periods of disunity, but overall the age was remarkably stable and marked by a sophisticated governing system that included the concept of a meritocracy. Each dynasty had its own distinct characteristics and in many eras encounters with foreign cultural and political influences through territorial expansion and waves of immigration also brought new stimulus to China. China was a highly literate society that greatly valued poetry and brush-written calligraphy, which along with painting, were called the Three Perfections, reflecting the esteemed position of the arts in Chinese life.&nbsp;Imperial China produced many technological advancements that have enriched the world, including paper and porcelain.</p>\n"

As areas around the Baltic Sea were taken by the crusaders, traders and settlers&mdash;mostly German&mdash;moved in and profited economically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Mediterranean Sea, crusading led to the conquest and colonization of many islands, which arguably helped ensure Christian control of Mediterranean trade routes (at least for as long as the islands were held). Crusading also played a role in the conquest of the Iberian peninsula (now Spain and Portugal). This was finally completed in 1492, when the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand II and Isabella I conquered the last Muslim community on the peninsula&mdash;the city of Granada. They expelled Jews from the country in the same year. And of course, they also authorized and supported the expeditions of Christopher Columbus, who&mdash;like many European explorers of his day&mdash;believed that the expansion of the Christian faith was one of his duties.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"<p>Roman architecture was unlike anything that had come before. The Persians, Egyptians, Greeks and Etruscans all had monumental architecture. The grandeur of their buildings, though, was largely external. Buildings were designed to be impressive when viewed from outside because their architects all had to rely on building in a post-and-lintel system, which means that they used two upright posts, like columns, with a horizontal block, known as a lintel, laid flat across the top. A good example is this ancient Greek Temple in Paestum, Italy.</p>\n"

Thanks to these innovations, from the first century&nbsp;C.E. Romans were able to create interior spaces that had previously been unheard of. Romans became increasingly concerned with shaping interior space rather than filling it with structural supports. As a result, the inside of Roman buildings were as impressive as their exteriors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Materials, Methods and Innovations</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Long before concrete made its appearance on the building scene in Rome, the Romans utilized a volcanic stone native to Italy called tufa to construct their buildings. Although tufa never went out of use, travertine began to be utilized in the late 2nd century&nbsp;B.C.E. because it was more durable. Also, its off-white color made it an acceptable substitute for marble.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Temple of Portunus (formerly known as, Fortuna Virilis), travertine, tufa, and stucco, c. 120-80 B.C.E., Rome \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c8c9dc83eded999feaeac75e9db1f79177049bd3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Temple of Portunus (formerly known as, Fortuna Virilis),<br />\n"
"c. 120-80 B.C.E., &nbsp;structure is&nbsp;travertine and&nbsp;tufa,&nbsp;stuccoed to look like Greek marble,&nbsp;Rome</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Marble was slow to catch on in Rome during the Republican period since it was seen as an extravagance, but after the reign of Augustus (31 B.C.E. - 14 C.E.), marble became quite fashionable. Augustus had famously claimed in his funerary inscription, known as the <em>Res Gestae</em>, that he &ldquo;found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble&rdquo; referring to his ambitious building campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman concrete (<em>opus caementicium</em>), was developed early in the 2nd c. BCE. &nbsp;The use of mortar as a bonding agent in ashlar masonry wasn&rsquo;t new in the ancient world; mortar was a combination of sand, lime and water in proper proportions. The major contribution the Romans made to the mortar recipe was the introduction of volcanic Italian sand (also known as &ldquo;pozzolana&rdquo;). &nbsp;The Roman builders who used pozzolana rather than ordinary sand noticed that their mortar was incredibly strong and durable. It also had the ability to set underwater. Brick and tile were commonly plastered over the concrete since it was not considered very pretty on its own, but concrete&rsquo;s structural possibilities were far more important. The invention of <em>opus caementicium</em> initiated the Roman architectural revolution, allowing for builders to be much more creative with their designs. Since concrete takes the shape&nbsp;of the mold or frame it is poured into, buildings began to take on ever more fluid and creative shapes.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Romans also exploited the opportunities afforded to architects by the innovation of the true arch (as opposed to a corbeled arch where&nbsp;stones are laid so that they move slightly in toward the center as they move higher).&nbsp;A true&nbsp;arch is composed of wedge-shaped blocks (typically of a durable stone), called voussoirs, with a key stone in the center holding them into place. In a true&nbsp;arch, weight is transferred from one voussoir down to the next, from the top of the arch to ground level, creating a sturdy building tool. True arches&nbsp;can span greater distances than a simple post-and-lintel.&nbsp;The use of concrete, combined with the employment of true arches allowed for vaults and domes to be built, creating expansive and breathtaking interior spaces.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Roman Architects</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about Roman architects. &nbsp;Few individual architects are known to us because the dedicatory inscriptions, which appear on finished buildings, usually commemorated the person who commissioned and paid for the structure. We do know that architects came from all walks of life, from freedmen all the way up to the Emperor Hadrian, and they were responsible for all aspects of building on a project. The architect would design the building and act as engineer; he would serve as contractor and supervisor and would attempt to keep the project within budget.</p>\n"

The destruction allowed Nero to take over valuable real estate for his own building project; a vast new villa. Although the choice was not in the public interest, Nero&rsquo;s desire to live in grand fashion did spur on the architectural revolution in Rome. The architects, Severus and Celer, are known (thanks to the Roman historian Tacitus), and they built a grand palace, complete with courtyards, dining rooms, colonnades and fountains. They also used concrete extensively, including barrel vaults and domes throughout the complex. &nbsp;What makes the Golden House unique in Roman architecture is that Severus and Celer were using concrete in new and exciting ways; rather than utilizing the material for just its structural purposes, the architects began to experiment with concrete in aesthetic modes, for instance, to make expansive domed spaces. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Nero may have started a new trend for bigger and better concrete architecture, but Roman architects, and the emperors who supported them, took that trend and pushed it to its greatest potential. &nbsp;Vespasian&rsquo;s Colosseum, the Markets of Trajan, the Baths of Caracalla and the Basilica of Maxentius are just a few of the most impressive structures to come out of the architectural revolution in Rome. Roman architecture was not entirely comprised of concrete, however. &nbsp;Some buildings, which were made from marble, hearkened back to the sober, Classical beauty of Greek architecture, like the Forum of Trajan. &nbsp;Concrete structures and marble buildings stood side by side in Rome, demonstrating that the Romans appreciated the architectural history of the Mediterranean just as much as they did their own innovation. &nbsp;Ultimately, Roman architecture is overwhelmingly a success story of experimentation and the desire to achieve something new.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Roman architecture was unlike anything that had come before. The Persians, Egyptians, Greeks and Etruscans all had monumental architecture. The grandeur of their buildings, though, was largely external. Buildings were designed to be impressive when viewed from outside because their architects all had to rely on building in a post-and-lintel system, which means that they used two upright posts, like columns, with a horizontal block, known as a lintel, laid flat across the top. A good example is this ancient Greek Temple in Paestum, Italy.</p>\n"

Thanks to these innovations, from the first century&nbsp;C.E. Romans were able to create interior spaces that had previously been unheard of. Romans became increasingly concerned with shaping interior space rather than filling it with structural supports. As a result, the inside of Roman buildings were as impressive as their exteriors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Materials, Methods and Innovations</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Long before concrete made its appearance on the building scene in Rome, the Romans utilized a volcanic stone native to Italy called tufa to construct their buildings. Although tufa never went out of use, travertine began to be utilized in the late 2nd century&nbsp;B.C.E. because it was more durable. Also, its off-white color made it an acceptable substitute for marble.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Temple of Portunus (formerly known as, Fortuna Virilis), travertine, tufa, and stucco, c. 120-80 B.C.E., Rome \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c8c9dc83eded999feaeac75e9db1f79177049bd3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Temple of Portunus (formerly known as, Fortuna Virilis),<br />\n"
"c. 120-80 B.C.E., &nbsp;structure is&nbsp;travertine and&nbsp;tufa,&nbsp;stuccoed to look like Greek marble,&nbsp;Rome</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Marble was slow to catch on in Rome during the Republican period since it was seen as an extravagance, but after the reign of Augustus (31 B.C.E. - 14 C.E.), marble became quite fashionable. Augustus had famously claimed in his funerary inscription, known as the <em>Res Gestae</em>, that he &ldquo;found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble&rdquo; referring to his ambitious building campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman concrete (<em>opus caementicium</em>), was developed early in the 2nd c. BCE. &nbsp;The use of mortar as a bonding agent in ashlar masonry wasn&rsquo;t new in the ancient world; mortar was a combination of sand, lime and water in proper proportions. The major contribution the Romans made to the mortar recipe was the introduction of volcanic Italian sand (also known as &ldquo;pozzolana&rdquo;). &nbsp;The Roman builders who used pozzolana rather than ordinary sand noticed that their mortar was incredibly strong and durable. It also had the ability to set underwater. Brick and tile were commonly plastered over the concrete since it was not considered very pretty on its own, but concrete&rsquo;s structural possibilities were far more important. The invention of <em>opus caementicium</em> initiated the Roman architectural revolution, allowing for builders to be much more creative with their designs. Since concrete takes the shape&nbsp;of the mold or frame it is poured into, buildings began to take on ever more fluid and creative shapes.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Romans also exploited the opportunities afforded to architects by the innovation of the true arch (as opposed to a corbeled arch where&nbsp;stones are laid so that they move slightly in toward the center as they move higher).&nbsp;A true&nbsp;arch is composed of wedge-shaped blocks (typically of a durable stone), called voussoirs, with a key stone in the center holding them into place. In a true&nbsp;arch, weight is transferred from one voussoir down to the next, from the top of the arch to ground level, creating a sturdy building tool. True arches&nbsp;can span greater distances than a simple post-and-lintel.&nbsp;The use of concrete, combined with the employment of true arches allowed for vaults and domes to be built, creating expansive and breathtaking interior spaces.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Roman Architects</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about Roman architects. &nbsp;Few individual architects are known to us because the dedicatory inscriptions, which appear on finished buildings, usually commemorated the person who commissioned and paid for the structure. We do know that architects came from all walks of life, from freedmen all the way up to the Emperor Hadrian, and they were responsible for all aspects of building on a project. The architect would design the building and act as engineer; he would serve as contractor and supervisor and would attempt to keep the project within budget.</p>\n"

(<a href=\"http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/canali/inviaggio/cultura/2011/04/03/visualizza_new.html_1526559668.html\">photo source</a>)</span></span>The Emperor Nero began building his infamous Domus Aurea, or Golden House, after a great fire swept through Rome in 64 C.E. and destroyed much of the downtown area. The destruction allowed Nero to take over valuable real estate for his own building project; a vast new villa. Although the choice was not in the public interest, Nero&rsquo;s desire to live in grand fashion did spur on the architectural revolution in Rome. The architects, Severus and Celer, are known (thanks to the Roman historian Tacitus), and they built a grand palace, complete with courtyards, dining rooms, colonnades and fountains. They also used concrete extensively, including barrel vaults and domes throughout the complex. &nbsp;What makes the Golden House unique in Roman architecture is that Severus and Celer were using concrete in new and exciting ways; rather than utilizing the material for just its structural purposes, the architects began to experiment with concrete in aesthetic modes, for instance, to make expansive domed spaces. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Nero may have started a new trend for bigger and better concrete architecture, but Roman architects, and the emperors who supported them, took that trend and pushed it to its greatest potential. &nbsp;Vespasian&rsquo;s Colosseum, the Markets of Trajan, the Baths of Caracalla and the Basilica of Maxentius are just a few of the most impressive structures to come out of the architectural revolution in Rome. Roman architecture was not entirely comprised of concrete, however. &nbsp;Some buildings, which were made from marble, hearkened back to the sober, Classical beauty of Greek architecture, like the Forum of Trajan. &nbsp;Concrete structures and marble buildings stood side by side in Rome, demonstrating that the Romans appreciated the architectural history of the Mediterranean just as much as they did their own innovation. &nbsp;Ultimately, Roman architecture is overwhelmingly a success story of experimentation and the desire to achieve something new.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The fragments from the wall painting in the tomb-chapel of Nebamun&nbsp;are keenly observed vignettes of Nebamun and his family enjoying both work and play. Some concern the provision of the funerary cult that was celebrated in the tomb-chapel, some show scenes of Nebamun&rsquo;s life as an elite official, and others show him and his family enjoying life for all eternity, as in the famous scene of the family hunting in the marshes. Together they decorated the small tomb-chapel with vibrant and engaging images of an elite lifestyle that Nebamun hoped would continue in the afterlife.</p>\n"

"<p>Nebamun is shown hunting birds, in a small boat with his wife Hatshepsut and their young daughter, in the marshes of the Nile. Such scenes had already been traditional parts of tomb-chapel decoration for hundreds of years and show the dead tomb-owner &quot;enjoying himself and seeing beauty,&quot;&nbsp;as the hieroglyphic caption here says.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This is more than a simple image of recreation. Fertile marshes were seen as a place of rebirth and eroticism. Hunting animals could represent Nebamun&rsquo;s triumph over the forces of nature as he was reborn. The huge striding figure of Nebamun dominates, forever happy and forever young, surrounded by the rich and varied life of the marsh.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There was originally another half of the scene, which showed Nebamun spearing fish. This half of the wall is lost, apart from two old photographs of small fragments of Nebamun and his young son. The painters have captured the scaly and shiny quality of the fish.</p>\n"

"<p>What does the Taj Mahal have to do with the Tamerlane? What do Persian carpets have to do with Turkish tiles? Quite a bit, as it turns out. By the fourteenth century, Islam had spread as far East as India and Islamic rulers had solidified their power by establishing prosperous cities and a robust trade in decorative arts along the all-important Silk Road.&nbsp;This is a complex period with competing and overlapping cultures and empires. Read below for an introduction to the later Islamic dynasties.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ottoman (1300-1924)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At its earliest stages, the Ottoman state was little more than a group formed as a result of the dissolution of the Anatolian Seljuq sultanate. However, in 1453, the Ottomans captured the great Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and in 1517, they defeated the Mamluks and took control of the most significant state in the Islamic world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mimar Sinan, Süleymaniye Mosque built for the Sultan Süleyman the Lawgiver, 1558, Istanbul\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/817ed1bd1be8379d1a2e141af26e5d413d5aecf6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Mimar Sinan, S&uuml;leymaniye Mosque built for the Sultan S&uuml;leyman the Lawgiver, 1558, Istanbul</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the Ottomans ruled for many centuries, the height of the empire&#39;s cultural and economic prosperity was achieved during S&uuml;leyman the Magnificent&#39;s reign (r. 1520-1566), a period often referred to as the Ottoman&#39;s &lsquo;golden age.&rsquo; In addition to large-scale architectural projects, the decorative arts flourished, chief among them, ceramics, particularly tiles. Iznik tiles, named for the city in Anatolia where they were produced, developed a trademark style of curling vines and flowers rendered in beautiful shades of blue and turquoise. These designs were informed by the blue and white floral patterns found in Chinese porcelain&mdash;similar to earlier Mamluk tiles, and Timurid art to the East. In addition to Iznik, other artistic hubs developed, such as Bursa, known for its silks, and Cairo for its carpets. The capital, Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), became a great center for all matters of cultural importance from manuscript illumination to architecture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Sinan, Rüstem Paşa Mosque, mihrab and minbar \n"
"Mimar Sinan, Rüstem Pasha Mosque, 1561-63 (Istanbul)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3e7feeb1fc561e3507e1e491ea92327bbf748cce.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Iznik tiles in&nbsp;Sinan,&nbsp;R&uuml;stem Pasha Mosque, 1561-63 (Istanbul)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The architecture of the period, both sacred and secular, incorporates these decorative arts, from the dazzling blue tiles and monumental calligraphy that adorn the walls of Topkapi Palace (begun 1459) to the carpets that line the floors of the S&uuml;leymaniye Mosque (1550-1558). Ottoman mosque architecture itself is marked by the use of domes, widely used earlier in Byzantium, and towering minarets. The Byzantine influence draws primarily from Hagia Sophia, a former church that was <a href=\"/humanities/medieval-world/byzantine1/constantinople-east/v/hagia-sophia-mosque\">converted into a mosque</a> (and is now a museum).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Timurid (1369-1502)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/73129983bd866cd1ea05fb6d632a90d2c01cf536.png\" /><br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-caption\">Timurid Dynasty at its greatest extent</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This powerful Central Asian dynasty was named for its founder, Tamerlane (ruled 1370-1405), which is derived from Timur the Lame. Despite his rather pathetic epithet, he claimed to be a descendent of Genghis Khan and demonstrated some of his supposed ancestor&rsquo;s ruthlessness in conquering neighboring territories.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After establishing a vast empire, Timur developed a monumental architecture befitting his power, and sought to make Samarkand the &ldquo;pearl of the world.&rdquo; Because the capital was situated at a major crossroads of the Silk Road (the crucial trade route linking the Middle East, Central Asia, and China), and because Timur had conquered so widely, the Timurids acquired a myriad of artisans and craftspeople from distinct artistic traditions. The resulting style synthesized aesthetic and design principles from as far away as India (then Hindustan) and the lands in between.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/07c17fea1d543b4a018d924ea304e03ff154350f.jpg\" /><br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-caption\">Registan, Samarkand, Uzbekistan, 15th-17th centuries</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The result can be seen in cities filled with buildings created on a lavish scale that exhibited tall, bulbous domes and the finest ceramic tiles. The structures and even the cities themselves are often described foremost by the overwhelming use of blues and golds. While the Timurid dynasty itself was short-lived, its legacy survives not only in the grand architecture that it left behind but in its descendents who went on to play significant roles in the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal empires.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Safavid (1502-1736)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Safavids, a group with roots in the Sufic tradition (a mystical branch of Islam), came to power in Persia, modern-day Iran and Azerbaijan. In 1501 the Safavid rulers declared Shi&rsquo;a Islam as its state religion; and in just ten years the empire came to include all of Iran.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The art of manuscript illumination was highly prized in the Safavid courts, and royal patrons made many large-scale commissions. Perhaps the most notable of these is the Shahnama (or &lsquo;Book of Kings,&rsquo; a compilation of stories about earlier rulers of Iran) from the 1520s. While painting in this context did not have the same prominent and longstanding tradition as it does in Western art, the illustrations exhibit masterful workmanship and an incredible attention to detail.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Trade in carpets was also important, and even today, people understand the appeal of Persian carpets. These large-scale, high-quality pieces were created as luxurious furnishings for royal&nbsp;courts. The most famous&mdash;perhaps of all time&mdash;is a pair known as the Ardabil Carpets, created in 1539-1540. The carpets were nearly identical, perfectly symmetrical and enormous. Every inch of space was filled with flowers, scrolling vines, and medallions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The empire began to struggle financially and militarily until the rule of Shah Abbas (r. 1587-1629). He moved the capital to Isfahan where he built a magnificent new city and established state workshops for textiles, which, along with silk and other goods, were increasingly exported to Europe. The mosque architecture made use of earlier Persian elements, like the four-iwan plan and building materials of brick and glazed tiles reminiscent of Timurid architecture, with its blues and greens and bulbous domes. Even in such far-removed lands, the connections between these dynasties are evident in the art they created.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Mughal (1526-1858)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Though Islam had been introduced in India centuries before, the Mughals were responsible for some of the greatest works of art produced in the canons of both Indian and Islamic art. The empire established itself when Babur, himself a Timurid prince of Turkish and Central Asian descent, came to Hindustan and defeated the existing Islamic sultanate in Delhi.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tracing their roots to Central Asia, the Mughals produced art, music and poetry that was highly influenced by Persian and Central Asian aesthetics. This is evident in the style and importance given to miniature paintings, created to illustrate manuscripts. The most grandiose of these was the Akbarnama, created to record the conquests of Akbar, widely regarded as the greatest Mughal emperor. The art and architecture created during his reign demonstrate a synthesis of indigenous Indian temple architecture with structural and design elements derived from Islamic sources farther West. The Mughals developed a unique architectural style which, in the years after Akbar&rsquo;s reign, began to feature scalloped arches and stylized floral designs in white marble. The most famous example is the Taj Mahal, constructed by Shah Jahan from 1632-1653.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Taj Mahal, Agra, India, 1632-53\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6e43b8c6ad1cc49db1f5eb3334df58f36d5fac14.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Taj Mahal, Agra, India, 1632-53, photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mknott/1352093343\">Mathew Knott</a>&nbsp;(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Mughal dynasty left a lasting mark on the landscape of India, and remained in power until the British completed their conquest of India in the nineteenth century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although historians generally agree that the major Islamic dynasties end in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Islamic art and culture have continued to flourish. Muslim artists and Muslim countries are still producing art. Some art historians consider such work as simply modern or contemporary art while others see it within the continuity of Islamic art.</p>\n"

"<h3>Visiting a bookseller</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The similarities run much further than mere physical traits, however. Take for example the manner in which the book was made and acquired from the 13th century onwards. If you wanted a book in the later Middle Ages you went to a store, as in our modern day. However, the bookseller did not normally have any books in stock&mdash;except for perhaps some second-hand copies. You would tell him what you wanted, both content-wise and with respect to the object&rsquo;s material features. You could specify, for example, that he use paper (instead of parchment), cursive script (and not book script) and add miniatures (or forego&nbsp;decoration). Just like so many other objects you bought in late-medieval society, the commercially-made manuscript was custom-tailored to the individual who purchased it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The professionals who made books for profit were usually found near the biggest church in town. This was a well-chosen spot as canons and clerics (i.e. people who visited the church and who could read) formed an important part of the clientele. By the 14th century true communities of the book had formed in the neighborhoods around churches and cathedrals. Evidence from such cities as Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, London and Paris suggests that in these communities a diverse group of artisans interacted with clients and with each other. It was a world bound not only by the book, however, but also by profit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Marketing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Whether you were scribe, illuminator or binder, as a professional you would strive for quality and diversity as this ensured bread and butter on the table. In parallel to our modern book business, medieval manuscript artisans used various marketing strategies to attract new clientele. The most striking of these is advertisements. Scribes hung large sheets outside their doors to show what kind of scripts they had mastered. The short writing samples found on these sheets were often accompanied by the names of the scripts, which shows just how professional the world of the book had become. A particularly rich specimen survives from the shop of Herman Strepel, a professional scribe in M&uuml;nster (c. 1447). In the true spirit of medieval marketing he wrote the names of all the scripts in golden letters on his advertisement sheet.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Advertisement sheet from Herman Strepel, professional scribe in Münster, c. 1447, The Hague, Royal Library, 76 D 45\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3363cf4bd723d9a4e74103541c6bf165b6e5fe31.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Advertisement sheet from Herman Strepel, professional scribe in M&uuml;nster,&nbsp;The Hague, Royal Library, 76 D MS 45,&nbsp;c. 1447</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Scribes also included advertisements in books they had copied for a client. An example of such &ldquo;spam&rdquo; is found in a French manuscript made in Paris by a scribe who calls himself Herneis. On the last page of the book he writes, &ldquo;If someone else would like such a handsome book, come and look me up in Paris, across the Notre Dame cathedral.&rdquo; Herneis and his fellow bookmen lived and worked in the Rue Neuve Notre Dame, which served as the center of commercially-made vernacular books. Similarly, students were served in the Rue St Jacques, on the Left Bank, where the latest Latin textbooks were on offer. For Parisians and students it was handy to have all the professionals in one street: you knew where to go when you needed a book and it was easy to check out who was available for making one for you.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Book streets</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This centralization was equally convenient, however, for the artisans themselves. Booksellers (also called stationers) in Rue Neuve Notre Dame and in other such &ldquo;book streets&rdquo; in European cities depended on the professional scribes, illuminators and binders that lived in their vicinity. They would hire them for various projects. When a client came to order a book from a stationer, the latter would divide the work among the artisans he usually worked with.

"<h3>Visiting a bookseller</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The similarities run much further than mere physical traits, however. Take for example the manner in which the book was made and acquired from the 13th century onwards. If you wanted a book in the later Middle Ages you went to a store, as in our modern day. However, the bookseller did not normally have any books in stock&mdash;except for perhaps some second-hand copies. You would tell him what you wanted, both content-wise and with respect to the object&rsquo;s material features. You could specify, for example, that he use paper (instead of parchment), cursive script (and not book script) and add miniatures (or forego&nbsp;decoration). Just like so many other objects you bought in late-medieval society, the commercially-made manuscript was custom-tailored to the individual who purchased it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The professionals who made books for profit were usually found near the biggest church in town. This was a well-chosen spot as canons and clerics (i.e. people who visited the church and who could read) formed an important part of the clientele. By the 14th century true communities of the book had formed in the neighborhoods around churches and cathedrals. Evidence from such cities as Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, London and Paris suggests that in these communities a diverse group of artisans interacted with clients and with each other. It was a world bound not only by the book, however, but also by profit.</p>\n"

"<h3>Marketing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Whether you were scribe, illuminator or binder, as a professional you would strive for quality and diversity as this ensured bread and butter on the table. In parallel to our modern book business, medieval manuscript artisans used various marketing strategies to attract new clientele. The most striking of these is advertisements. Scribes hung large sheets outside their doors to show what kind of scripts they had mastered. The short writing samples found on these sheets were often accompanied by the names of the scripts, which shows just how professional the world of the book had become. A particularly rich specimen survives from the shop of Herman Strepel, a professional scribe in M&uuml;nster (c. 1447). In the true spirit of medieval marketing he wrote the names of all the scripts in golden letters on his advertisement sheet.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Scribes also included advertisements in books they had copied for a client. An example of such &ldquo;spam&rdquo; is found in a French manuscript made in Paris by a scribe who calls himself Herneis. On the last page of the book he writes, &ldquo;If someone else would like such a handsome book, come and look me up in Paris, across the Notre Dame cathedral.&rdquo; Herneis and his fellow bookmen lived and worked in the Rue Neuve Notre Dame, which served as the center of commercially-made vernacular books. Similarly, students were served in the Rue St Jacques, on the Left Bank, where the latest Latin textbooks were on offer. For Parisians and students it was handy to have all the professionals in one street: you knew where to go when you needed a book and it was easy to check out who was available for making one for you.</p>\n"

"<h3>Book streets</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This centralization was equally convenient, however, for the artisans themselves. Booksellers (also called stationers) in Rue Neuve Notre Dame and in other such &ldquo;book streets&rdquo; in European cities depended on the professional scribes, illuminators and binders that lived in their vicinity. They would hire them for various projects. When a client came to order a book from a stationer, the latter would divide the work among the artisans he usually worked with. One copied the text, another drew the images, and a third bound the book. These hired hands were given contracts which specified precisely what they would have to do and how much money they received for it. From time to time the stationer would come and check on the progress they made. In some manuscripts these cost estimates were scribbled in the margin.&nbsp;Although making books for profit was a common scenario in the later Middle Ages, it did not make you particularly rich. On the last page of a Middle Dutch chronicle a clearly frustrated scribe wrote, &ldquo;For so little money I never want to produce a book ever again!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n"

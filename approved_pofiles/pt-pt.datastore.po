"<h3>Pseudocode</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We just described the binary search algorithm in English, stepping through\n"
"one example. That's one way to do it, but a human language explanation can vary\n"
"in quality. It can be too short or too long, and most importantly, it's not\n"
"always as precise as it should be. We could jump to showing you binary search in\n"
"a programming language like JavaScript or Python, but programs contain lots of \n"
"details - due to requirements imposed by the programming language, or because \n"
"programs have to handle errors caused by bad data, user error, or system faults \n"
"- and those can make it hard to understand the underlying algorithm from\n"
"studying just the code. That's why we prefer to describe algorithms in something\n"
"called pseudocode, which mixes English with features that you see in programming \n"
"languages. </p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Here's the pseudocode for binary search, modified for searching in\n"
"an array.  The inputs are the array, which we call <code>array</code>;\n"
"the number <code>n</code> of elements in <code>array</code>; and\n"
"<code>target</code>, the number being searched for.  The output \n"
"is the index in <code>array</code> of <code>target</code>:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"\t\n"
"    <li> Let <code>min = 0</code> and <code>max = n-1</code>.</li>\n"
"\n"
"    <li> Compute <code>guess</code> as the average of <code>max</code>\n"
"\t\t\t\t and <code>min</code>, rounded down (so that it is an\n"
"\t\t\t\t integer).</li>\n"
"\n"
"    <li> If <code>array[guess]</code> equals <code>target</code>,\n"
"\t\t\t\t then stop.  You found it!  Return <code>guess</code>.</li>\n"
"\n"
"    <li> If the guess was too low, that is, <code>array[guess] <\n"
"\t\t\t\t target</code>, then set <code>min = guess + 1</code>.</li>\n"
"\n"
"    <li> Otherwise, the guess was too high.  Set <code>max = guess -\n"
"\t\t\t\t 1</code>.</li>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<li> Go back to step 2.</li>\n"
"\n"
"</ol></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Implementing pseudocode</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We'll alternate between English, pseudocode, and JavaScript in these tutorials, \n"
"depending on the situation.  As a programmer, you should learn to understand \n"
"pseudocode and be able to turn it into your language of choice - so even though \n"
"we're using JavaScript here, it should be straightforward for you to implement\n"
"pseudocode using other languages. \n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How would we turn that pseudocode into a JavaScript program? We should create a function,\n"
"because we're writing code that accepts an input and returns an output,\n"
"and we want that code to be reusable for different inputs.\n"
"The parameters to the function&mdash;let's call it <code>binarySearch</code>&mdash;\n"
"will be the array and target value,\n"
"and the return value of the function will be the index of the location where\n"
"the target value was found.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now let's go into the body of the function, and decide how to implement that.\n"
"Step 6 says to go back to step 2.  That sounds like a loop.  Should\n"
"it be a for-loop or a while-loop?  If you really wanted to use a\n"
"for-loop, you could, but the indices guessed by binary search don't go\n"
"in the sequential order that a for-loop makes convenient.  First we\n"
"might guess the index 12, and then 18, based on some computations.  So\n"
"a while-loop is the better choice.</p>\n"

"<p>Let's see how to think about binary search on a sorted array.  Yes,\n"
"JavaScript already provides methods for determining whether a\n"
"given element is in an array and, if it is, its location (as do many\n"
"programming languages), but we want to implement it ourselves, to\n"
"understand how you can implement such methods.  Here's a JavaScript\n"
"array of the first 25 prime numbers, in order:</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Looking at the example below, we can read the array of prime numbers from left to right, one at a time, until we find the number 67 (in the pink box) and see that it is at array index 18. Looking through the numbers in order like this is a <em>linear search</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Once we know that the prime number 67 is at index 18, we can identify that it is a prime. We can also quickly identify that there are 18 elements which come before 67 in the array, meaning that there are 18 prime numbers smaller than 67.</p>\n"

"<h3>Pseudocode</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We just described the binary search algorithm in English, stepping through\n"
"one example. That's one way to do it, but a human language explanation can vary\n"
"in quality. It can be too short or too long, and most importantly, it's not\n"
"always as precise as it should be. We could jump to showing you binary search in\n"
"a programming language like JavaScript or Python, but programs contain lots of \n"
"details - due to requirements imposed by the programming language, or because \n"
"programs have to handle errors caused by bad data, user error, or system faults \n"
"- and those can make it hard to understand the underlying algorithm from\n"
"studying just the code. That's why we prefer to describe algorithms in something\n"
"called pseudocode, which mixes English with features that you see in programming \n"
"languages. </p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Here's the pseudocode for binary search, modified for searching in\n"
"an array.  The inputs are the array, which we call <code>array</code>;\n"
"the number <code>n</code> of elements in <code>array</code>; and\n"
"<code>target</code>, the number being searched for.  The output \n"
"is the index in <code>array</code> of <code>target</code>:\n"

"\t\n"
"    <li> Let <code>min = 0</code> and <code>max = n-1</code>.</li>\n"

"</ol></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Implementing pseudocode</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We'll alternate between English, pseudocode, and JavaScript in these tutorials, \n"
"depending on the situation.  As a programmer, you should learn to understand \n"
"pseudocode and be able to turn it into your language of choice - so even though \n"
"we're using JavaScript here, it should be straightforward for you to implement\n"
"pseudocode using other languages. \n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How would we turn that pseudocode into a JavaScript program? We should create a function,\n"
"because we're writing code that accepts an input and returns an output,\n"
"and we want that code to be reusable for different inputs.\n"
"The parameters to the function&mdash;let's call it <code>binarySearch</code>&mdash;\n"
"will be the array and target value,\n"
"and the return value of the function will be the index of the location where\n"
"the target value was found.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now let's go into the body of the function, and decide how to implement that.\n"
"Step 6 says to go back to step 2.  That sounds like a loop.  Should\n"
"it be a for-loop or a while-loop?  If you really wanted to use a\n"
"for-loop, you could, but the indices guessed by binary search don't go\n"
"in the sequential order that a for-loop makes convenient.  First we\n"
"might guess the index 12, and then 18, based on some computations.  So\n"
"a while-loop is the better choice.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There's also an important step missing in that pseudocode that\n"
"didn't matter for the guessing game, but does matter for the binary\n"
"search of an array.  What should happen if the number you are looking\n"
"for is <em>not</em> in the array?  Let's start by figuring out what\n"

So in the face of each one may be seen love, fear, indignation, or grief at not being able to understand the meaning of Christ; and this excites no less astonishment than the obstinate hatred and treachery to be seen in Judas.&quot; &nbsp;(Georgio Vasari, <em>Lives of the Artists</em>, 1568; translated by George Bull)</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Subject</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The subject of the <em>Last Supper</em> is Christ&rsquo;s final meal with his apostles before Judas identifies Christ to the authorities who arrest him. The Last Supper (a Passover Seder), is remembered for two events:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Philip (detail), Leonardo da Vinci, Last Supper, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e6d7fa573d0d1f22efc69ad633054dc77ec2d836.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Philip (detail), Leonardo da Vinci, Last Supper, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Christ says to his apostles &ldquo;One of you will betray me,&rdquo; and the apostles react, each according to his own personality. &nbsp;Referring to the Gospels, Leonardo depicts Philip asking &ldquo;Lord, is it I?&rdquo; &nbsp;Christ replies, &ldquo;He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me&rdquo; (Matthew 26). &nbsp;We see Christ and Judas simultaneously reaching toward a plate that lies between them, even as Judas defensively backs away.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Leonardo also simultaneously depicts&nbsp;Christ blessing&nbsp;the bread and saying&nbsp;to the apostles &ldquo;Take, eat; this is my body&rdquo; and blessing&nbsp;the wine and saying&nbsp;&ldquo;Drink from it all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matthew 26). &nbsp;These words are the founding moment of the sacrament of the Eucharist (the miraculous transformation of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Leonardo da Vinci, Last Supper, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bd34aa1fb099fe9712631a61f33f63cea444d487.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Detail, Leonardo da Vinci, <em>Last Supper</em>, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Apostles Identified</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Last Supper</em>&nbsp;is dense with symbolic references. &nbsp;Attributes identify each apostle. For example, Judas Iscariot is recognized both as he reaches to toward a plate beside Christ (Matthew 26) and because he clutches a purse containing his reward for identifying Christ to the authorities the following day. Peter, who sits beside Judas, holds a knife in his right hand,&nbsp;foreshadowing&nbsp;that Peter will sever the ear of a soldier as he attempts to protect Christ from arrest.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Suggestions of the heavenly</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The balanced composition is anchored by an equilateral triangle formed by Christ&rsquo;s body. He sits below an arching pediment that if completed, traces a circle. These ideal geometric forms refer to the renaissance interest in Neo-Platonism (an element of the humanist revival that reconciles aspects of Greek philosophy with Christian theology).&nbsp;In his allegory, &ldquo;The Cave,&rdquo; the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato emphasized the imperfection of the earthly realm. Geometry, used by the Greeks to express heavenly perfection, has been used by Leonardo to celebrate Christ as the embodiment of heaven on earth.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Leonardo rendered a verdant landscape beyond the windows. Often interpreted as paradise, it has been suggested that this heavenly sanctuary can only be reached through Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The twelve apostles are arranged as four groups of three and there are also three windows. The number three is often a reference to the Holy Trinity in Catholic art. In contrast, the number four is important in the classical tradition (e.g. Plato&rsquo;s four virtues).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Last Supper in the&nbsp;Early Renaissance</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f8a3de9fe8df501c3c655d18b76b25b0348e41e4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Andrea del Castagno,<em> Last Supper</em>, 1447, tempera on plaster (Sant&#39;Apollonia, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Andrea del Castagno&rsquo;s <em>Last Supper</em> (1447) is typical of the Early Renaissance. The use of linear perspective in combination with ornate forms such as the sphinxes on the ends of the bench and the marble paneling tend to detract from the spirituality of the event. In contrast, Leonardo simplified the architecture, eliminating unnecessary and distracting details so that the architecture can instead amplify the spirituality. The window and arching pediment even suggest a halo. &nbsp;By crowding all of the figures together, Leonardo uses the table as a barrier to separate the spiritual realm from the viewer&rsquo;s earthly world. Paradoxically, Leonardo&rsquo;s emphasis on spirituality results in a painting that is more naturalistic than Castagno&rsquo;s.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Condition</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The<em> Last Supper</em> is in terrible condition. Soon after the painting was completed on February 9, 1498 it began to deteriorate. By the second half of the sixteenth century Giovan Paulo Lomazzo stated that, &ldquo;&hellip;the painting is all ruined.&rdquo; Over the past five hundred years the painting&rsquo;s condition has been seriously compromised by its location, the materials and techniques used, humidity, dust, and poor restoration efforts. Modern problems have included a bomb that hit the monastery destroying a large section of the refectory on August 16, 1943, severe air pollution in postwar Milan, and finally, the effects of crowding tourists.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Bartholomew, James Minor, and Andrew (detail), Leonardo da Vinci, Last Supper, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan)\n"

"\n"
"<p>Because Leonardo sought a greater detail and luminosity than could be achieved with traditional fresco, he covered the wall with a double layer of dried plaster. Then, borrowing from panel painting, he added an undercoat of lead white to enhance the brightness of the oil and tempera that was applied on top. This experimental technique allowed for chromatic brilliance and extraordinary precision but because the painting is on a thin exterior wall, the effects of humidity were felt more keenly, and the paint failed to properly adhere to the wall.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There have been seven documented attempts to repair the <em>Last Supper</em>. The first restoration effort took place in 1726, the last and most extensive was completed in 1999. Instead of attempting to restore the image, the last conservation effort sought to arrest further deterioration and where possible, uncover Leonardo&rsquo;s original painting. Begun in 1977 and comprising more than 12,000 hours of structural work and 38,000 hours of work on the painting itself, this effort has resulted in an image where approximately 42.5% of the surface is Leonardo&rsquo;s work, 17.5% is lost, and the remaining 40% are the additions of previous restorers.

"<p>&quot;Leonardo imagined, and has succeeded in expressing, the desire that has entered the minds of the apostles to know who is betraying their Master. So in the face of each one may be seen love, fear, indignation, or grief at not being able to understand the meaning of Christ; and this excites no less astonishment than the obstinate hatred and treachery to be seen in Judas.&quot; &nbsp;(Georgio Vasari, <em>Lives of the Artists</em>, 1568; translated by George Bull)</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Disciplina</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The subject of the <em>Last Supper</em> is Christ&rsquo;s final meal with his apostles before Judas identifies Christ to the authorities who arrest him. The Last Supper (a Passover Seder), is remembered for two events:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Philip (detail), Leonardo da Vinci, Last Supper, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e6d7fa573d0d1f22efc69ad633054dc77ec2d836.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Philip (detail), Leonardo da Vinci, Last Supper, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Christ says to his apostles &ldquo;One of you will betray me,&rdquo; and the apostles react, each according to his own personality. &nbsp;Referring to the Gospels, Leonardo depicts Philip asking &ldquo;Lord, is it I?&rdquo; &nbsp;Christ replies, &ldquo;He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me&rdquo; (Matthew 26). &nbsp;We see Christ and Judas simultaneously reaching toward a plate that lies between them, even as Judas defensively backs away.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Leonardo also simultaneously depicts&nbsp;Christ blessing&nbsp;the bread and saying&nbsp;to the apostles &ldquo;Take, eat; this is my body&rdquo; and blessing&nbsp;the wine and saying&nbsp;&ldquo;Drink from it all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matthew 26). &nbsp;These words are the founding moment of the sacrament of the Eucharist (the miraculous transformation of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Leonardo da Vinci, Last Supper, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bd34aa1fb099fe9712631a61f33f63cea444d487.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Detail, Leonardo da Vinci, <em>Last Supper</em>, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Apostles Identified</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Last Supper</em>&nbsp;is dense with symbolic references. &nbsp;Attributes identify each apostle. For example, Judas Iscariot is recognized both as he reaches to toward a plate beside Christ (Matthew 26) and because he clutches a purse containing his reward for identifying Christ to the authorities the following day. Peter, who sits beside Judas, holds a knife in his right hand,&nbsp;foreshadowing&nbsp;that Peter will sever the ear of a soldier as he attempts to protect Christ from arrest.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Suggestions of the heavenly</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The balanced composition is anchored by an equilateral triangle formed by Christ&rsquo;s body. He sits below an arching pediment that if completed, traces a circle. These ideal geometric forms refer to the renaissance interest in Neo-Platonism (an element of the humanist revival that reconciles aspects of Greek philosophy with Christian theology).&nbsp;In his allegory, &ldquo;The Cave,&rdquo; the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato emphasized the imperfection of the earthly realm. Geometry, used by the Greeks to express heavenly perfection, has been used by Leonardo to celebrate Christ as the embodiment of heaven on earth.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Leonardo rendered a verdant landscape beyond the windows. Often interpreted as paradise, it has been suggested that this heavenly sanctuary can only be reached through Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The twelve apostles are arranged as four groups of three and there are also three windows. The number three is often a reference to the Holy Trinity in Catholic art. In contrast, the number four is important in the classical tradition (e.g. Plato&rsquo;s four virtues).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Last Supper in the&nbsp;Early Renaissance</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f8a3de9fe8df501c3c655d18b76b25b0348e41e4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Andrea del Castagno,<em> Last Supper</em>, 1447, tempera on plaster (Sant&#39;Apollonia, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Andrea del Castagno&rsquo;s <em>Last Supper</em> (1447) is typical of the Early Renaissance. The use of linear perspective in combination with ornate forms such as the sphinxes on the ends of the bench and the marble paneling tend to detract from the spirituality of the event. In contrast, Leonardo simplified the architecture, eliminating unnecessary and distracting details so that the architecture can instead amplify the spirituality. The window and arching pediment even suggest a halo. &nbsp;By crowding all of the figures together, Leonardo uses the table as a barrier to separate the spiritual realm from the viewer&rsquo;s earthly world. Paradoxically, Leonardo&rsquo;s emphasis on spirituality results in a painting that is more naturalistic than Castagno&rsquo;s.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Condition</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The<em> Last Supper</em> is in terrible condition. Soon after the painting was completed on February 9, 1498 it began to deteriorate. By the second half of the sixteenth century Giovan Paulo Lomazzo stated that, &ldquo;&hellip;the painting is all ruined.&rdquo; Over the past five hundred years the painting&rsquo;s condition has been seriously compromised by its location, the materials and techniques used, humidity, dust, and poor restoration efforts. Modern problems have included a bomb that hit the monastery destroying a large section of the refectory on August 16, 1943, severe air pollution in postwar Milan, and finally, the effects of crowding tourists.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Because Leonardo sought a greater detail and luminosity than could be achieved with traditional fresco, he covered the wall with a double layer of dried plaster. Then, borrowing from panel painting, he added an undercoat of lead white to enhance the brightness of the oil and tempera that was applied on top. This experimental technique allowed for chromatic brilliance and extraordinary precision but because the painting is on a thin exterior wall, the effects of humidity were felt more keenly, and the paint failed to properly adhere to the wall.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There have been seven documented attempts to repair the <em>Last Supper</em>. The first restoration effort took place in 1726, the last and most extensive was completed in 1999. Instead of attempting to restore the image, the last conservation effort sought to arrest further deterioration and where possible, uncover Leonardo&rsquo;s original painting. Begun in 1977 and comprising more than 12,000 hours of structural work and 38,000 hours of work on the painting itself, this effort has resulted in an image where approximately 42.5% of the surface is Leonardo&rsquo;s work, 17.5% is lost, and the remaining 40% are the additions of previous restorers. Most of this repainting is found in the wall hangings and the ceiling.</p>\n"

"<p>You can think of a red blood cell as a box&nbsp;holding hemoglobin molecules. Each hemoglobin molecule has two parts, called &quot;heme&quot; and&nbsp;&quot;globin&quot;. Globin is a&nbsp;protein,&nbsp;which is like bricks and mortar for&nbsp;a house; it provides structure. The heme is a disk within the globin protein&nbsp;that holds a single atom of iron in its center. In fact, iron is what makes blood the color red when it&#39;s around oxygen,&nbsp;just like how iron will rust (also red!) in the presence of oxygen. Each&nbsp;heme&nbsp;can attach to 1 molecule of oxygen&nbsp;and&nbsp;each globin holds exactly&nbsp;4 hemes.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>That&#39;s a lot of oxygen! &nbsp;If&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t have enough red blood cells and/or hemoglobin, then your body won&rsquo;t be able to effectively transport oxygen.&nbsp;Check out &quot;<a href=\"/science/health-and-medicine/hematologic%20system%20diseases/anemia/v/rn-anemia\">What is anemia</a>?&quot; for a quick overview.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>What are the symptoms of anemia?</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Since anemia means that you&nbsp;don&rsquo;t have enough red blood cells and/or hemoglobin&nbsp;to effectively transport oxygen around the body;&nbsp;all of the symptoms relate back to this problem.&nbsp;Oxygen doesn&#39;t get delivered effectively to the brain, muscles, and skin leading to some common symptoms like&nbsp;fatigue, poor concentration, weakness, and&nbsp;pale skin (called pallor). These symptoms are common for all anemias.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"anemia - common symptoms\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/af490176237d17687a8d73ae3ebdf13333e93d30.png\" /></span>On the other hand, some symptoms are specific to the underlying cause of anemia:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><u>Hemolytic anemias</u> are a group of diseases in which the&nbsp;red blood cells are destroyed prematurely. When hemoglobin within red blood cells&nbsp;is broken down, the center rings of the protein (called heme) are converted into&nbsp;bilirubin. We usually get rid of bilirubin through urine/stool, but if there is too much of it floating around, then it&nbsp;can build up in the body and cause&nbsp;the&nbsp;skin to turn yellow (aka.&nbsp;jaundice).</li>\n"
"\t<li>In <u>iron-defiency anemia</u>, the body is&nbsp;not able to make hemoglobin effectively since each heme contains a bit of iron&nbsp;within it. Patients lacking iron sometimes get the strange urge to&nbsp;eat things&nbsp;like dirt, sand, or ice as a result.&nbsp;</li>\n"
"\t<li>In pregnant women, the blood gets diluted as blood volume goes up but the number of red blood cells stay the same. This form of &quot;<u>dilutional anemia</u>&quot; is common, and the increased blood volume can cause heart palpitations (that feeling of your heart skipping a beat).</li>\n"
"\t<li>Patients with <u>sickle cell anemia</u> have&nbsp;red blood cells that are deformed and don&#39;t sail smoothly through blood vessels. When these red blood cells&nbsp;clog up&nbsp;blood vessels it can lead to intense pain in the&nbsp;bones or chest.&nbsp;</li>\n"

"<h1>How likely are you to get anemia?</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anemia is the most common blood disorder affecting 1.6 billion people (1 in 4), with young children and pregnant women most at risk. The likelihood you could develop anemia depends on the underlying cause of the anemia. For example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Iron deficiency anemia makes up for&nbsp;half of all anemias globally and is more common in women due to their menstral cycle.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Sickle cell anemia affects&nbsp;1 in 100 people in Africa, but 1 in 3000 in the United States. This is because sickle cell anemia is a genetic disease found in people of African heritage.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Vegetarians/vegans, pregnant mothers, and alcoholics have an increased risk for nutrient deficiency anemias:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Vegetarians/vegans&nbsp;have an increased risk for iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency anemias because animal products contain these nutrients.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Pregnant women have increased iron and vitamin needs to help their fetus grow and are at an increased risk for iron, folate, and vitamin B12 deficiencies.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Alcohol impairs the ability of the liver to metabolize folate leading to folate deficiency anemia in alcoholics.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>How can you prevent anemia?</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anemias caused by a deficiency of iron, folate, and vitamin B12 are easy to prevent with the use of vitamin supplements and a healthy diet.&nbsp;Other anemias such as sickle cell are genetic and cannot be prevented.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h1>How do you treat anemia?</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anemia is treated by resolving the underlying cause of the anemia. Patients with anemia from sudden blood loss may be given a blood transfusion, and patients with low iron or folate levels will be given vitamin and mineral supplements. Additional medications may be given to treat the disease itself, such as steroids to depress the immune system&nbsp;for hemolytic anemia.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\t<li>You may have&nbsp;noticed that men have more&nbsp;red blood cells and hemoglobin in a given volume of blood&nbsp;than women.&nbsp;Why do you think that might be?

"\t<li>Some athletes have been found &quot;blood doping&quot;, by using products like the hormone erythropoietin before a major event. &nbsp;Why would they do that? One reason is that erythropoietin (normally made in the kidney) is a hormone that&nbsp;helps to boost the production of RBC&#39;s. Injecting extra erythropoietin means that more RBC&#39;s are made, which means&nbsp;more oxygen is carried to muscles with each heart beat during the event.&nbsp;Blood doping is considered cheating in most&nbsp;sports, and it&#39;s&nbsp;dangerous to the athlete because rapidly getting too many RBCs&nbsp;increases the thickness of blood, which can lead to heart failure and stroke!</li>\n"

"\n"
"<p>You can think of a red blood cell as a box&nbsp;holding hemoglobin molecules. Each hemoglobin molecule has two parts, called &quot;heme&quot; and&nbsp;&quot;globin&quot;. Globin is a&nbsp;protein,&nbsp;which is like bricks and mortar for&nbsp;a house; it provides structure. The heme is a disk within the globin protein&nbsp;that holds a single atom of iron in its center. In fact, iron is what makes blood the color red when it&#39;s around oxygen,&nbsp;just like how iron will rust (also red!) in the presence of oxygen. Each&nbsp;heme&nbsp;can attach to 1 molecule of oxygen&nbsp;and&nbsp;each globin holds exactly&nbsp;4 hemes.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>That&#39;s a lot of oxygen! &nbsp;If&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t have enough red blood cells and/or hemoglobin, then your body won&rsquo;t be able to effectively transport oxygen.&nbsp;Check out &quot;<a href=\"/science/health-and-medicine/hematologic%20system%20diseases/anemia/v/rn-anemia\">What is anemia</a>?&quot; for a quick overview.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>What are the symptoms of anemia?</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Since anemia means that you&nbsp;don&rsquo;t have enough red blood cells and/or hemoglobin&nbsp;to effectively transport oxygen around the body;&nbsp;all of the symptoms relate back to this problem.&nbsp;Oxygen doesn&#39;t get delivered effectively to the brain, muscles, and skin leading to some common symptoms like&nbsp;fatigue, poor concentration, weakness, and&nbsp;pale skin (called pallor). These symptoms are common for all anemias.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"anemia - common symptoms\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/af490176237d17687a8d73ae3ebdf13333e93d30.png\" /></span>On the other hand, some symptoms are specific to the underlying cause of anemia:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><u>Hemolytic anemias</u> are a group of diseases in which the&nbsp;red blood cells are destroyed prematurely. When hemoglobin within red blood cells&nbsp;is broken down, the center rings of the protein (called heme) are converted into&nbsp;bilirubin. We usually get rid of bilirubin through urine/stool, but if there is too much of it floating around, then it&nbsp;can build up in the body and cause&nbsp;the&nbsp;skin to turn yellow (aka.&nbsp;jaundice).</li>\n"
"\t<li>In <u>iron-defiency anemia</u>, the body is&nbsp;not able to make hemoglobin effectively since each heme contains a bit of iron&nbsp;within it. Patients lacking iron sometimes get the strange urge to&nbsp;eat things&nbsp;like dirt, sand, or ice as a result.&nbsp;</li>\n"
"\t<li>In pregnant women, the blood gets diluted as blood volume goes up but the number of red blood cells stay the same. This form of &quot;<u>dilutional anemia</u>&quot; is common, and the increased blood volume can cause heart palpitations (that feeling of your heart skipping a beat).</li>\n"
"\t<li>Patients with <u>sickle cell anemia</u> have&nbsp;red blood cells that are deformed and don&#39;t sail smoothly through blood vessels. When these red blood cells&nbsp;clog up&nbsp;blood vessels it can lead to intense pain in the&nbsp;bones or chest.&nbsp;</li>\n"

"<h1>How likely are you to get anemia?</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anemia is the most common blood disorder affecting 1.6 billion people (1 in 4), with young children and pregnant women most at risk. The likelihood you could develop anemia depends on the underlying cause of the anemia. For example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Iron deficiency anemia makes up for&nbsp;half of all anemias globally and is more common in women due to their menstral cycle.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Sickle cell anemia affects&nbsp;1 in 100 people in Africa, but 1 in 3000 in the United States. This is because sickle cell anemia is a genetic disease found in people of African heritage.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Vegetarians/vegans, pregnant mothers, and alcoholics have an increased risk for nutrient deficiency anemias:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Vegetarians/vegans&nbsp;have an increased risk for iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency anemias because animal products contain these nutrients.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Pregnant women have increased iron and vitamin needs to help their fetus grow and are at an increased risk for iron, folate, and vitamin B12 deficiencies.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Alcohol impairs the ability of the liver to metabolize folate leading to folate deficiency anemia in alcoholics.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>How can you prevent anemia?</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anemias caused by a deficiency of iron, folate, and vitamin B12 are easy to prevent with the use of vitamin supplements and a healthy diet.&nbsp;Other anemias such as sickle cell are genetic and cannot be prevented.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"anemia - foods to eat\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/82bac1790a39cd00161a8e8cd154240a23aaf993.png\" /></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Como se trata uma anemia?</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anemia is treated by resolving the underlying cause of the anemia. Patients with anemia from sudden blood loss may be given a blood transfusion, and patients with low iron or folate levels will be given vitamin and mineral supplements. Additional medications may be given to treat the disease itself, such as steroids to depress the immune system&nbsp;for hemolytic anemia.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1><span style=\"font-family:proxima nova,sans-serif; font-size:24px; line-height:30.4px\">Consider the following:</span></h1>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>You may have&nbsp;noticed that men have more&nbsp;red blood cells and hemoglobin in a given volume of blood&nbsp;than women.&nbsp;Why do you think that might be? Scientists are not sure yet, but one hypothesis is that&nbsp;higher testosterone levels in men stimulates red blood cell production.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Some athletes have been found &quot;blood doping&quot;, by using products like the hormone erythropoietin before a major event. &nbsp;Why would they do that? One reason is that erythropoietin (normally made in the kidney) is a hormone that&nbsp;helps to boost the production of RBC&#39;s. Injecting extra erythropoietin means that more RBC&#39;s are made, which means&nbsp;more oxygen is carried to muscles with each heart beat during the event.&nbsp;Blood doping is considered cheating in most&nbsp;sports, and it&#39;s&nbsp;dangerous to the athlete because rapidly getting too many RBCs&nbsp;increases the thickness of blood, which can lead to heart failure and stroke!</li>\n"

"<h1>Ushnus</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Inka capital Cusco and principal outlying towns of the Inka Empire were organized around a public plaza with a specially-constructed platform placed facing a designated sacred central space called the <em>ushnu</em>. This sacred space was marked by a vertical opening into the body of the earth into which liquid and other offerings were made.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The&nbsp;ushnu&nbsp;platform was therefore&nbsp;a kind of stage from which the Inka king and his&nbsp;lords could observe and rule&nbsp;over&nbsp;an annual round of seasonal festivals and ceremonial events.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9e7a705861d3f5936d8370865c3219a439b1e1e5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">This&nbsp;ushnu (Incapirca Waminan)&nbsp;is situated on the summit of the mountain and comprises three superimposed platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy; Trustees of the British Museum</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the late 1990s archaeologists in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina began mapping the full system of Inka roads, including many of the less accessible, secondary trails at high altitude. In Peru this survey soon revealed a previously unrecognized category of stone platform with typically distinctive Inka stonework. These structures are carefully positioned on isolated mountain-tops&nbsp;4000&ndash;4800 meters above sea level&nbsp;and represent some of the highest dressed-stone architecture found anywhere in the Americas, and possibly in the world. These structures were clearly&nbsp;important in Inca political and sacred geography and had profound symbolic significance.<br />\n"

In this way local deities were incorporated into the overarching Inka state religion. The Incas used the platforms as potent symbols of religious and political authority. They served as an innovative and powerful new instrument of statecraft in order both to define and proclaim their growing imperial hegemony.</p>\n"

"<p>Atahualpa, the Inka ruler taken and killed by Spanish invaders in the 1500s, asked for the meeting with his murderers to take place in the great plaza of the town of Cajamarca at the site of a &quot;<em>castillejo</em>,&quot;&nbsp;a type of platform we now call an <em>ushnu</em>.&nbsp;This shows not only that <em>ushnus</em> were appropriate sites to meet strangers, but that they were considered to hold great significance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Research at 30 platforms across the modern&nbsp;area of Ayacucho has demonstrated that <em>ushnus</em> are located in both town squares and alongside Inka roads. In towns, the platforms are located in or by the side of the main square, while those located on Inca roads are often found on mountain tops. There, they offer views of the horizon and of <em>Wamanis</em> (mountain deities) in the landscape.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>The major <em>ushnu</em> platform at&nbsp;Vilcashuaman, which has been extensively restored comprises four superimposed platforms with a staircase of 36 steps on its eastern side, which, through a gateway, allows access to the top. The staircase is built up against the structure, abutting it. The top platform on its west side has a ramp allowing access to the platform below. On top the platform has a large monolithic seat carved to accommodate two people.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"On its eastern side two squarish structures are built up close to the bottom platform; beyond this are the remains of a large <em>kallanka</em> or great hall and it is likely there was a second one of these across an open space. Slightly further to the west is the town&#39;s cemetery.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To the east and north-east is the main colonial plaza and to the north-east are extensive elaborate Inka remains including what have been identified as the footings of the local temples of the sun and moon. The fields surrounding the town are extensively dedicated to growing maize, barley and oats.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p><strong><span>Is the curriculum translated into different languages?</span></strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Translators are currently localizing full&nbsp;curricula into <a href=\"https://es.khanacademy.org/hourofcode\">Spanish</a>, <a href=\"https://pt.khanacademy.org/hourofcode\">Portuguese</a>, and <a href=\"https://fr.khanacademy.org/hourofcode\">French</a>.

While the code itself won&#39;t&nbsp;be translated, the fully interactive platform and all&nbsp;relevant articles, challenges and projects will be localized for audiences around the world. Interactive transcripts in these languages will also be available so learners can go at their own pace,&nbsp;in their own language.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The International Team aims to make&nbsp;the full platform&nbsp;experience&nbsp;available in languages across the world.

"\n"
"<p><strong>Is the curriculum accessible to deaf students?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Yes, there is a&nbsp;transcript option available for the talk-throughs. Click the gear menu next to the play bar and select &quot;Interactive Transcript.&quot; Students can pause the talk-through&nbsp;if it is going too quickly.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Do the tutorials&nbsp;work on an iPad?​</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The code editor does not work very well on an iPad, so we have developed a&nbsp;block-based input mechanism for the Hour of Drawing with Code, <a href=\"/r/hour-of-code-blocks\">which your students can visit here</a>. We recommend this option for iPad users.</p>\n"

"<p><strong>Do the tutorials&nbsp;work on ChromeBooks?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>ChromeBooks use the Google Chrome browser, which is one of Khan Academy&#39;s supported browsers, so yes, all of the tutorials should work well on a ChromeBook.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Can students continue working on Hour of Code after the class?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Yes! They can work on it at their own pace at any time. They should sign up for an account in the classroom if they want to easily pick up at home from where they left off in the classroom.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Abode of Islam</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the life of Ibn Battuta (sometimes spelled Battutah), Islamic civilization stretched from the Atlantic coast of West Africa across northern Africa, the Middle East, and India to Southeast Asia. This constituted the <em>Dar al-Islam</em>, or &ldquo;Abode of Islam.&rdquo; In addition, there were important communities&nbsp;<span>of Muslims in cities and towns beyond the frontiers of Dar al-Islam. People in the whole &ldquo;umma,&rdquo; or community of people believing in one god and his sacred law (&ldquo;shari&rsquo;a&rdquo;), shared doctrinal beliefs, religious rituals, moral values, and everyday manners. In the early 1300s this community was expanding dramatically.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Background</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta was born in Tangier, part of modern-day Morocco, on February 25, 1304. This port city on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean lies 45 miles west of the Mediterranean Sea, close to the western side of the Strait of Gibraltar &mdash; where Africa and Europe nearly collide.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The men in Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s family were legal scholars and he was raised with a focus on education; however, there was no &ldquo;madrasa,&rdquo; or college of higher learning, in Tangier. Thus, Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s urge to travel was spurred by interest in finding the best teachers and the best libraries, which were then in Alexandria, Cairo, and Damascus. He also wanted to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, called the &ldquo;hajj,&rdquo; as soon as possible, out of eagerness and devotion to his faith.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://course.bighistoryproject.com/media/khan/KU8.1.6-2_Battuta.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">An interactive display at the Ibn Battuta Mall in Dubai, Dubai Construction Update, Imre Solt </span></span>On June 14, 1325, at the age of 21, Ibn Battuta rode out of Tangier on a donkey, the start of his journey to Mecca. Unlike the young Marco Polo,&nbsp;<span>he was quite alone, as illustrated by this passage from <em>The Travels of Ibn Battuta</em>, his detailed account of his wanderings:</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveler in whose companionship I might find cheer, nor caravan whose party I might join, but swayed&nbsp;<span>by an overmastering impulse within me and a desire long-cherished in my bosom to visit these illustrious sanctuaries. So I braced my resolution to quit all my dear ones, female and male, and forsook my home as birds forsake their nests. My parents being yet in the bonds of life, it weighed sorely upon me to part from them, and both they and I were afflicted with sorrow at this separation.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&mdash; from The Travels of Ibn Battutah</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Travels</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s solitude did not last long, according to his chronicles. The governor of one city gave him alms of gold and woolen cloth, as almsgiving was considered a pillar of Islam. Ibn Battuta stayed at madrasas and at Sufi hospices as he made his way to Tunis. By the time he left Tunis he was serving as a paid judge, a <em>qadi</em>, of a caravan of pilgrims who needed their disputes settled by a well-educated man. Alexandria and Damascus were two highlights on the part of the trip that followed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta entered Mecca in mid-October 1326, a year and four months after leaving home. He stayed a month, taking part in all the ritual experiences and talking with diverse people from every Islamic land. While his writings don&rsquo;t provide much detail about what this experience meant to him, after it was over he set out for Baghdad instead of returning home. He traveled in a camel caravan of returning pilgrims, and this is when his real globetrotting began.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta led a complete life while traveling. He studied and prayed;&nbsp;<span>he practiced his legal profession; he had astonishing outdoor adventures; he married at least 10 times and left children growing up all over Afro-Eurasia. A few examples of these activities provide a good picture of his life&rsquo;s journey.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Alexandria, Ibn Battuta spent three days as a guest of a locally venerated Sufi ascetic by the name of Burhan al-Din the Lame. This holy man saw that Ibn Battuta had a passion for travel. He suggested that Ibn Battuta visit three other fellow Sufis, two in India and one in China. Of the encounter with&nbsp;<span>Buurhan al-Din, Ibn Battuta wrote in his <em>Travels</em>, &ldquo;I was amazed at his [Burhan al-Din&rsquo;s] prediction, and the idea of going to these countries having been cast into my mind, my wanderings never ceased until I had met these three that he named and conveyed his greeting to them.&rdquo;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta visited another saint who lived a quiet life of devotion in a town near Alexandria. It was summer and Ibn Battuta slept on the roof of the man&rsquo;s cell. There he had a dream of a large bird that carried him far eastward and left him there. The saint interpreted this to mean that Ibn Battuta would travel to India and stay there for a long time, echoing what Burhan al-Din had said.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://course.bighistoryproject.com/media/khan/KU8.1.6-3_Battuta.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Caravan going to Mecca, from The Maqamat by Al-Hariri &copy; The Gallery Collection/CORBIS</span></span><span>In Damascus, Ibn Battuta boarded in one of the three madrasas. During his 24-day stay he settled down into some formal studies. Damascus had the largest concentration of famous theologians and jurists in the Arab-speaking world. They taught by reading and commenting on a classical book, then testing their students&rsquo; knowledge of it and issuing certificates to those who passed their tests.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta then fulfilled the prophesies of the various seers he&rsquo;d met by traveling to India via Afghanistan, where he had to cross the Hindu Kush Mountains at one of several high passes. His group crossed at the 13,000-foot (4,000-meter) Khawak Pass. &ldquo;We crossed the mountains,&rdquo; Ibn Battuta re-called in <em>Travels</em>, &ldquo;setting out about the end of the night and traveling all day long until sunset. We kept spreading felt clothes in front of the camels for them to tread on, so that they would not sink in the snow.&rdquo; Upon arriving in Delhi, Ibn Battuta sought an official career from the Muslim king of India, Muhammad Tughluq.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The king of India made a practice of appointing foreigners as ministers&nbsp;<span>and judges. As Ibn Battuta traveled to the court in Delhi, 82 Hindu bandits attacked his group of 22; Ibn Battuta and his men drove them off, killing&nbsp;</span><span>13 of the thieves. King Tughluq appointed him judge of Delhi, but since Ibn Battuta did not speak Persian, the language of the court, two scholars were appointed to do the work of hearing cases. After eight years, Ibn Battuta was eager to escape the political intrigue. The king agreed to send him as an ambassador to China, and made him responsible for taking shiploads of&nbsp;</span><span>goods to the Yuan emperor, in return for the emperor&rsquo;s previous gifts of 100 slaves and cartloads of cloth and swords.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta was set to sail from Calcutta with one large ship holding the goods for the Chinese emperor and a smaller ship filled with his personal entourage. Everything and everybody was loaded for departure, but Ibn Battuta spent the last day in the city attending Friday prayers. That evening a storm blew in, and the large ship with the presents ran aground and sank.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The smaller one, with Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s servants, concubines, friends, and personal belongings, took to sea to escape the storm. Reduced to his prayer rug and the clothes on his back, Ibn Battuta could only hope to catch up with the ship carrying his group.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Thus Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s travels continued, with narrow escapes and dramatically varying fortunes. Eventually he learned that his ship had been seized by a non-Muslim ruler in Sumatra. He decided to go to China anyway, but stopped on the way at the Maldives, an island group 400 miles southwest off the coast of India.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Maldives, Ibn Battuta enjoyed the company of women even more than usual. Usually, he married one at a time and divorced her when he left on further travels. He often had concubines, too, purchased or given as gifts. In the Maldives he married four women on one island, the legal limit under Muslim law. As he wrote in his <em>Travels</em>:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>It is easy to marry in these islands because of the smallness of the dowries and the pleasures of society which the women offer... When the ships put in, the crew marry; when they intend to leave they divorce their wives. This is a kind of temporary marriage. The women of these islands never leave their country.</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From there, Ibn Battuta continued on to China. Battuta&rsquo;s narrative about China occupies less than 6 percent of his whole story. It is so sketchy and confusing that some scholars doubt that he even went to China and believe he merely fabricated this part of his account. He claims to have gone as far north as Beijing, but his description of that is even vaguer than the rest, so perhaps he only got as far north as Quanzhou, now Zaitun. In any case, he admits in the Travels that in China he was unable to understand or accept much of what he saw; it was not part of his familiar Dar al-Islam:</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Abode of Islam</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the life of Ibn Battuta (sometimes spelled Battutah), Islamic civilization stretched from the Atlantic coast of West Africa across northern Africa, the Middle East, and India to Southeast Asia. This constituted the <em>Dar al-Islam</em>, or &ldquo;Abode of Islam.&rdquo; In addition, there were important communities&nbsp;<span>of Muslims in cities and towns beyond the frontiers of Dar al-Islam. People in the whole &ldquo;umma,&rdquo; or community of people believing in one god and his sacred law (&ldquo;shari&rsquo;a&rdquo;), shared doctrinal beliefs, religious rituals, moral values, and everyday manners. In the early 1300s this community was expanding dramatically.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Fundo</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta was born in Tangier, part of modern-day Morocco, on February 25, 1304. This port city on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean lies 45 miles west of the Mediterranean Sea, close to the western side of the Strait of Gibraltar &mdash; where Africa and Europe nearly collide.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The men in Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s family were legal scholars and he was raised with a focus on education; however, there was no &ldquo;madrasa,&rdquo; or college of higher learning, in Tangier. Thus, Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s urge to travel was spurred by interest in finding the best teachers and the best libraries, which were then in Alexandria, Cairo, and Damascus. He also wanted to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, called the &ldquo;hajj,&rdquo; as soon as possible, out of eagerness and devotion to his faith.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://course.bighistoryproject.com/media/khan/KU8.1.6-2_Battuta.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">An interactive display at the Ibn Battuta Mall in Dubai, Dubai Construction Update, Imre Solt </span></span>On June 14, 1325, at the age of 21, Ibn Battuta rode out of Tangier on a donkey, the start of his journey to Mecca. Unlike the young Marco Polo,&nbsp;<span>he was quite alone, as illustrated by this passage from <em>The Travels of Ibn Battuta</em>, his detailed account of his wanderings:</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveler in whose companionship I might find cheer, nor caravan whose party I might join, but swayed&nbsp;<span>by an overmastering impulse within me and a desire long-cherished in my bosom to visit these illustrious sanctuaries. So I braced my resolution to quit all my dear ones, female and male, and forsook my home as birds forsake their nests. My parents being yet in the bonds of life, it weighed sorely upon me to part from them, and both they and I were afflicted with sorrow at this separation.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&mdash; from The Travels of Ibn Battutah</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Travels</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s solitude did not last long, according to his chronicles. The governor of one city gave him alms of gold and woolen cloth, as almsgiving was considered a pillar of Islam. Ibn Battuta stayed at madrasas and at Sufi hospices as he made his way to Tunis. By the time he left Tunis he was serving as a paid judge, a <em>qadi</em>, of a caravan of pilgrims who needed their disputes settled by a well-educated man. Alexandria and Damascus were two highlights on the part of the trip that followed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta entered Mecca in mid-October 1326, a year and four months after leaving home. He stayed a month, taking part in all the ritual experiences and talking with diverse people from every Islamic land. While his writings don&rsquo;t provide much detail about what this experience meant to him, after it was over he set out for Baghdad instead of returning home. He traveled in a camel caravan of returning pilgrims, and this is when his real globetrotting began.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta led a complete life while traveling. He studied and prayed;&nbsp;<span>he practiced his legal profession; he had astonishing outdoor adventures; he married at least 10 times and left children growing up all over Afro-Eurasia. A few examples of these activities provide a good picture of his life&rsquo;s journey.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Alexandria, Ibn Battuta spent three days as a guest of a locally venerated Sufi ascetic by the name of Burhan al-Din the Lame. This holy man saw that Ibn Battuta had a passion for travel. He suggested that Ibn Battuta visit three other fellow Sufis, two in India and one in China. Of the encounter with&nbsp;<span>Buurhan al-Din, Ibn Battuta wrote in his <em>Travels</em>, &ldquo;I was amazed at his [Burhan al-Din&rsquo;s] prediction, and the idea of going to these countries having been cast into my mind, my wanderings never ceased until I had met these three that he named and conveyed his greeting to them.&rdquo;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta visited another saint who lived a quiet life of devotion in a town near Alexandria. It was summer and Ibn Battuta slept on the roof of the man&rsquo;s cell. There he had a dream of a large bird that carried him far eastward and left him there. The saint interpreted this to mean that Ibn Battuta would travel to India and stay there for a long time, echoing what Burhan al-Din had said.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://course.bighistoryproject.com/media/khan/KU8.1.6-3_Battuta.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Caravan going to Mecca, from The Maqamat by Al-Hariri &copy; The Gallery Collection/CORBIS</span></span><span>In Damascus, Ibn Battuta boarded in one of the three madrasas. During his 24-day stay he settled down into some formal studies. Damascus had the largest concentration of famous theologians and jurists in the Arab-speaking world. They taught by reading and commenting on a classical book, then testing their students&rsquo; knowledge of it and issuing certificates to those who passed their tests.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta then fulfilled the prophesies of the various seers he&rsquo;d met by traveling to India via Afghanistan, where he had to cross the Hindu Kush Mountains at one of several high passes. His group crossed at the 13,000-foot (4,000-meter) Khawak Pass. &ldquo;We crossed the mountains,&rdquo; Ibn Battuta re-called in <em>Travels</em>, &ldquo;setting out about the end of the night and traveling all day long until sunset. We kept spreading felt clothes in front of the camels for them to tread on, so that they would not sink in the snow.&rdquo; Upon arriving in Delhi, Ibn Battuta sought an official career from the Muslim king of India, Muhammad Tughluq.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The king of India made a practice of appointing foreigners as ministers&nbsp;<span>and judges. As Ibn Battuta traveled to the court in Delhi, 82 Hindu bandits attacked his group of 22; Ibn Battuta and his men drove them off, killing&nbsp;</span><span>13 of the thieves. King Tughluq appointed him judge of Delhi, but since Ibn Battuta did not speak Persian, the language of the court, two scholars were appointed to do the work of hearing cases. After eight years, Ibn Battuta was eager to escape the political intrigue. The king agreed to send him as an ambassador to China, and made him responsible for taking shiploads of&nbsp;</span><span>goods to the Yuan emperor, in return for the emperor&rsquo;s previous gifts of 100 slaves and cartloads of cloth and swords.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ibn Battuta was set to sail from Calcutta with one large ship holding the goods for the Chinese emperor and a smaller ship filled with his personal entourage. Everything and everybody was loaded for departure, but Ibn Battuta spent the last day in the city attending Friday prayers. That evening a storm blew in, and the large ship with the presents ran aground and sank.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The smaller one, with Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s servants, concubines, friends, and personal belongings, took to sea to escape the storm. Reduced to his prayer rug and the clothes on his back, Ibn Battuta could only hope to catch up with the ship carrying his group.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Thus Ibn Battuta&rsquo;s travels continued, with narrow escapes and dramatically varying fortunes. Eventually he learned that his ship had been seized by a non-Muslim ruler in Sumatra. He decided to go to China anyway, but stopped on the way at the Maldives, an island group 400 miles southwest off the coast of India.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Maldives, Ibn Battuta enjoyed the company of women even more than usual. Usually, he married one at a time and divorced her when he left on further travels. He often had concubines, too, purchased or given as gifts. In the Maldives he married four women on one island, the legal limit under Muslim law. As he wrote in his <em>Travels</em>:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>It is easy to marry in these islands because of the smallness of the dowries and the pleasures of society which the women offer... When the ships put in, the crew marry; when they intend to leave they divorce their wives. This is a kind of temporary marriage. The women of these islands never leave their country.</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From there, Ibn Battuta continued on to China. Battuta&rsquo;s narrative about China occupies less than 6 percent of his whole story. It is so sketchy and confusing that some scholars doubt that he even went to China and believe he merely fabricated this part of his account. He claims to have gone as far north as Beijing, but his description of that is even vaguer than the rest, so perhaps he only got as far north as Quanzhou, now Zaitun. In any case, he admits in the Travels that in China he was unable to understand or accept much of what he saw; it was not part of his familiar Dar al-Islam:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>China was beautiful, but it did not please me. On the contrary, I was greatly troubled thinking about the way paganism dominated this country. Whenever I went out of my lodging, I saw many blameworthy things. That disturbed me so much that I stayed indoors most of&nbsp;<span>the time and only went out when necessary. During my stay in China, whenever I saw any Muslims I always felt as though I were meeting my own family and close kinsmen.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<h2>Overview</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I teach Basic Algebra at the Community College of Vermont (CCV). &nbsp;The goal of my course is largely for math placement and remediation, which I will talk in detail about later. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>CCV has twelve statewide locations and a large number of online courses. The college serves approximately 14,000 students per year with approximately 1500 of those being dual enrolled between high school and college. The average student age is 28 and 63% of our students are first-generation college students.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>A brief timeline of using Khan Academy in my classroom:</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I have used Khan Academy as my primary resource for three semesters and have used it one semester as a secondary resource for a total of 47 students.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>FIRST SEMESTER: Getting our toes wet...</strong><br />\n"
"I used KA as a series of optional Videos and Practice Exercises to complement my conventional Basic Algebra curriculum. This is a great way to learn about implementing and embedding Khan Academy into a course, but only proved itself to be useful to highly motivated and self-directed students.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>SECOND SEMESTER: Let&rsquo;s test this out a little more.</strong><br />\n"
"I made sporadic graded KA assignments to support my course objectives. The first thing I noticed was that students became more involved and enthusiastic about learning with Khan Academy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>THIRD &amp; FOURTH SEMESTERS: Diving in headfirst!</strong><br />\n"
"I made the quantum leap to using Khan Academy as my primary instructional resource and provided a free online open source textbook to complement my KA assignments. I learned three things:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Very few students chose to use the free online textbook. Some did because it was a better fit for their learning style, but the vast majority of students preferred using KA only.</li>\n"
"\t<li>I could use KA in a variety of ways to suit my students&rsquo; needs &ndash; more about that later in this case study.</li>\n"
"\t<li>On average, I calculate that, over two semesters, I saved my students over $4,000 in textbook costs!</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Goals: Placement and Remediation</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The main goal for this class is <strong>placement</strong>. Developmental math students at the Community College of Vermont are required to take an Accuplacer assessment as an admission requirement. &nbsp;This allows the school to have a snapshot of the student&rsquo;s math ability. &nbsp;The Accuplacer is not used as an exit criteria exam from a course, but I continue to use a second score at the end of the semester as benchmark to monitor progress from a standardized perspective. Both scores are only a piece of the assessment experience.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In terms of <strong>remediation</strong>, Khan Academy is my go-to tool. Using the real-time student progress data analysis tools I can quickly assess ongoing student needs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the beginning of each semester, I give a non-graded diagnostic exam to measure students&rsquo; readiness for the course and to identify learning gaps. Measuring this is enhanced by Khan Academy&rsquo;s analytics.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For me, the three most helpful reports here are:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Individual Student Progress</li>\n"
"\t<li>Individual Student Activity</li>\n"
"\t<li>Whole Class Skills Progress</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Student Progress Reports\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-share/Toolkit-photos/Case%20studies/Tim%20O%27Connor%20Case%20Studies/Screenshots/TimCCV_v03.gif\" /></span><strong>Note</strong>:<em> In order to convey the Coach experience without violating student privacy, this presentation uses a fictional class roster</em></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As I assess my students&rsquo; learning needs, I attempt to address the challenges I uncover and provide possible solutions. The remediation strategies I employ depend on each student&rsquo;s needs and on the needs of small groups of students. In each case, using Khan Academy Coach Recommendations helps me target student needs with specific individualized assignments.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Here are some of the most common general challenges I have encountered using Khan Academy&rsquo;s self-pacing capabilities, and some solutions that have worked for me some of the time. &nbsp;As you think about your own implementation, decide what might work best for you and your students. In all cases, my role as an instructor (or <em>coach</em>) is to facilitate and provide direct instruction as necessary.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Racing Ahead</strong><br />\n"
"If I&rsquo;m somewhere in the middle of a unit and realize that most of the class has already successfully completed the assigned Practice Exercises I will:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Assign <a href=\"/coach-res/reference-for-coaches/other-reference-materials/a/glossary-of-ka-terms\"><em><strong>Mastery Challenges</strong></em></a> as a way to cement concepts. &nbsp;Note that Khan Academy serves up specific Mastery Challenges as the system determines what each student needs in order to Level Up their skills.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Use<strong> small group</strong> and <strong>one-on-one sessions</strong> to work with students who are still struggling. &nbsp;This is a great place to employ peer tutors as both the tutors and tutees learn together.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Give students<strong> the opportunity to move ahead</strong> and/or<strong> choose <em>Mission</em> topics they&rsquo;re interested in </strong>or passionate about learning.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Learning Gaps</strong><br />\n"
"If, somewhere in the unit, I discover that a majority of the class is struggling with a foundational concept needed for the current topic at hand, I:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Use <a href=\"/coach-res/reference-for-coaches/how-to/a/make-a-recommendation\"><em><strong>Coach Recommendations</strong></em></a> as intentional assignments with a due date. &nbsp;Note that in all Coach Recommendations cases (individual, group, or whole class) each Practice Exercise has an embedded video to help with the topic (see image below).</li>\n"
"\t<li>Use <strong>one-on-one</strong> and<strong> small group</strong> peer or instructor tutoring sessions.<img alt=\"Screenshot of practice exercise with suggested video\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-share/Toolkit-photos/Case%20studies/Tim%20O%27Connor%20Case%20Studies/Screenshots/Tim%27s%20CCV%20Case%20Study%20-%20Condensed%20Teacher%20Version.png\" /></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Classroom Culture</strong><br />\n"
"Disheartened students can be informed and mentored around the concepts of <a href=\"/youcanlearnanything\">Grit and Growth Mindset</a>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Once understood and adopted by students, these powerful motivators help ensure success.</li>\n"
"\t<li>I show a series of TED Talks and YouTube videos that explain and model Grit and Growth Mindset.</li>\n"
"\t<li>The entire class takes an online Grit Test.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Blended Learning : Using Study Guides / Playlists and Missions</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Blended learning</strong> is a powerful concept that deserves a definition. Here&rsquo;s one articulated by the Clayton Christensen Institute.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>In a blended learning environment, students learn, at least in part, through online learning that gives them some element of control over time, place, path, and pace. At least part of the student learning experience is in a real school setting and, most importantly, what happens online is <u>not</u> disconnected from the classroom. In fact, what happens online actively informs what&rsquo;s happening in the classroom.</em></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When using <strong>curriculum mapped study guides</strong> (or <a href=\"/coach-res/higher-ed/developmental-math/a/resources-for-developmental-math-instructors\">playlists</a>) with blended learning, my students get specific weekly assignments aligned to the Accuplacer and to the course objectives I am required to meet for my college.

"<h2>Visão geral</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I teach Basic Algebra at the Community College of Vermont (CCV). &nbsp;The goal of my course is largely for math placement and remediation, which I will talk in detail about later. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>CCV has twelve statewide locations and a large number of online courses. The college serves approximately 14,000 students per year with approximately 1500 of those being dual enrolled between high school and college. The average student age is 28 and 63% of our students are first-generation college students.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>A brief timeline of using Khan Academy in my classroom:</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I have used Khan Academy as my primary resource for three semesters and have used it one semester as a secondary resource for a total of 47 students.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>FIRST SEMESTER: Getting our toes wet...</strong><br />\n"
"I used KA as a series of optional Videos and Practice Exercises to complement my conventional Basic Algebra curriculum. This is a great way to learn about implementing and embedding Khan Academy into a course, but only proved itself to be useful to highly motivated and self-directed students.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>SECOND SEMESTER: Let&rsquo;s test this out a little more.</strong><br />\n"
"I made sporadic graded KA assignments to support my course objectives. The first thing I noticed was that students became more involved and enthusiastic about learning with Khan Academy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>THIRD &amp; FOURTH SEMESTERS: Diving in headfirst!</strong><br />\n"
"I made the quantum leap to using Khan Academy as my primary instructional resource and provided a free online open source textbook to complement my KA assignments. I learned three things:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Very few students chose to use the free online textbook. Some did because it was a better fit for their learning style, but the vast majority of students preferred using KA only.</li>\n"
"\t<li>I could use KA in a variety of ways to suit my students&rsquo; needs &ndash; more about that later in this case study.</li>\n"
"\t<li>On average, I calculate that, over two semesters, I saved my students over $4,000 in textbook costs!</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Goals: Placement and Remediation</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The main goal for this class is <strong>placement</strong>. Developmental math students at the Community College of Vermont are required to take an Accuplacer assessment as an admission requirement. &nbsp;This allows the school to have a snapshot of the student&rsquo;s math ability. &nbsp;The Accuplacer is not used as an exit criteria exam from a course, but I continue to use a second score at the end of the semester as benchmark to monitor progress from a standardized perspective. Both scores are only a piece of the assessment experience.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In terms of <strong>remediation</strong>, Khan Academy is my go-to tool. Using the real-time student progress data analysis tools I can quickly assess ongoing student needs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the beginning of each semester, I give a non-graded diagnostic exam to measure students&rsquo; readiness for the course and to identify learning gaps. Measuring this is enhanced by Khan Academy&rsquo;s analytics.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For me, the three most helpful reports here are:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Individual Student Progress</li>\n"
"\t<li>Individual Student Activity</li>\n"
"\t<li>Whole Class Skills Progress</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Student Progress Reports\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-share/Toolkit-photos/Case%20studies/Tim%20O%27Connor%20Case%20Studies/Screenshots/TimCCV_v03.gif\" /></span><strong>Note</strong>:<em> In order to convey the Coach experience without violating student privacy, this presentation uses a fictional class roster</em></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As I assess my students&rsquo; learning needs, I attempt to address the challenges I uncover and provide possible solutions. The remediation strategies I employ depend on each student&rsquo;s needs and on the needs of small groups of students. In each case, using Khan Academy Coach Recommendations helps me target student needs with specific individualized assignments.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Here are some of the most common general challenges I have encountered using Khan Academy&rsquo;s self-pacing capabilities, and some solutions that have worked for me some of the time. &nbsp;As you think about your own implementation, decide what might work best for you and your students. In all cases, my role as an instructor (or <em>coach</em>) is to facilitate and provide direct instruction as necessary.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Racing Ahead</strong><br />\n"
"If I&rsquo;m somewhere in the middle of a unit and realize that most of the class has already successfully completed the assigned Practice Exercises I will:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Assign <a href=\"/coach-res/reference-for-coaches/other-reference-materials/a/glossary-of-ka-terms\"><em><strong>Mastery Challenges</strong></em></a> as a way to cement concepts. &nbsp;Note that Khan Academy serves up specific Mastery Challenges as the system determines what each student needs in order to Level Up their skills.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Use<strong> small group</strong> and <strong>one-on-one sessions</strong> to work with students who are still struggling. &nbsp;This is a great place to employ peer tutors as both the tutors and tutees learn together.</li>\n"
"\t<li>Give students<strong> the opportunity to move ahead</strong> and/or<strong> choose <em>Mission</em> topics they&rsquo;re interested in </strong>or passionate about learning.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Learning Gaps</strong><br />\n"
"If, somewhere in the unit, I discover that a majority of the class is struggling with a foundational concept needed for the current topic at hand, I:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Use <a href=\"/coach-res/reference-for-coaches/how-to/a/make-a-recommendation\"><em><strong>Coach Recommendations</strong></em></a> as intentional assignments with a due date. &nbsp;Note that in all Coach Recommendations cases (individual, group, or whole class) each Practice Exercise has an embedded video to help with the topic (see image below).</li>\n"
"\t<li>Use <strong>one-on-one</strong> and<strong> small group</strong> peer or instructor tutoring sessions.<img alt=\"Screenshot of practice exercise with suggested video\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-share/Toolkit-photos/Case%20studies/Tim%20O%27Connor%20Case%20Studies/Screenshots/Tim%27s%20CCV%20Case%20Study%20-%20Condensed%20Teacher%20Version.png\" /></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Classroom Culture</strong><br />\n"
"Disheartened students can be informed and mentored around the concepts of <a href=\"/youcanlearnanything\">Grit and Growth Mindset</a>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Once understood and adopted by students, these powerful motivators help ensure success.</li>\n"
"\t<li>I show a series of TED Talks and YouTube videos that explain and model Grit and Growth Mindset.</li>\n"
"\t<li>The entire class takes an online Grit Test.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Blended Learning : Using Study Guides / Playlists and Missions</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Blended learning</strong> is a powerful concept that deserves a definition. Here&rsquo;s one articulated by the Clayton Christensen Institute.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>In a blended learning environment, students learn, at least in part, through online learning that gives them some element of control over time, place, path, and pace. At least part of the student learning experience is in a real school setting and, most importantly, what happens online is <u>not</u> disconnected from the classroom. In fact, what happens online actively informs what&rsquo;s happening in the classroom.</em></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When using <strong>curriculum mapped study guides</strong> (or <a href=\"/coach-res/higher-ed/developmental-math/a/resources-for-developmental-math-instructors\">playlists</a>) with blended learning, my students get specific weekly assignments aligned to the Accuplacer and to the course objectives I am required to meet for my college. Because I use <strong>Moodle</strong>, a free, open-source e-learning platform, &nbsp;I am able to provide my students with hyperlinks from my weekly course modules to specific Khan Academy <em>Practice Exercises</em> and <em>Videos</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of Moodle\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-share/Toolkit-photos/Case%20studies/Tim%20O%27Connor%20Case%20Studies/Screenshots/Moodle_Screenshot.png\" /><em><span>Moodle, a free, e-learning platform used to provide learning&nbsp;resources for students</span></em></span><strong>Study Guides / Playlists </strong>allow me to set individual or class goals and develop timelines to keep my students on task, both in class and at home.

"\n"
"<p>If you&rsquo;ve seen the lesson on the <a href=\"/math/applied-math/cryptography/crypt/v/one-time-pad\">one-time pad</a>, you know that it is the <strong>ultimate shift cipher</strong>.

"\n"
"<p>To understand why, we need to first introduce the <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong> and <strong>XOR </strong>bitwise operations. Specifically why XOR must be used when performing the one-time pad on computers. <strong>Bitwise</strong> simply means that we are dealing with individual bits, or <strong>binary numbers</strong>.

"<h2>Encrypting Colors</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with&nbsp;a visual example by <strong>encrypting a color</strong> in the Khan Academy logo.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WAGKgpFmoaq2287korbEhbtD8mrMzkOIYQV8r9N2MGAqAiMsi5mE0yhpmm0nsckiXUJEUpH38WaG7zJhhGBSpsMgU5PwTH8H70zelf55Yu6rqqZbtO06C25Z\" /></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How do we turn a color into a number? Well, right now you are looking at HTML colors which are defined using the<strong> RGB color model.</strong> This is an additive model based on mixing some amount of <strong>red, green and blue light</strong>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5DP3owKxqcor8LAwr4tOwQdDt9XfAZtbmaQcgvfXVyXAr238DOQ5r-XByU11qfaMTyFOqUOdGkn4uFj2-3ovRetxAoosIvI8-4LSXtNDDYKCjHQbwlq5iOqh\" /></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We can define exactly how much RED, GREEN and BLUE <u>using a number from 0-255</u>. Black is <strong>all off</strong> (0,0,0) while white is <strong>all on</strong> (255,255,255). In between there are <strong>16 million possible colors</strong> (256 * 256 * 256). Next let&rsquo;s sample the green in the Khan Academy leaf in any image editing tool:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xWA5cyeYCA54M3d6jWGS5UmRl365xL7wucjbOQ3jgDI3BsRhqVPVRm7MSCG9qiP9vDgDjPQUQa-FIFTQz4mzdGWbftU8x7lMLFezknSz9UZ5Si5iWEdPUzly\" /></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Notice it stores it as &nbsp;RED=156, GREEN=181 &amp; BLUE=58. If we express these numbers in binary we get:<br />\n"
"10011100 + 10110101 + 00111010.&nbsp;Which we can squeeze together as: 100111001011010100111010</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>Binary RGB representation of the Khan Academy green:</strong></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Application of Random Shifts</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now let&rsquo;s say you generate a shift sequence using coin flips converted into binary as:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>HTHTTHTHHHHTTHTTTTHTTHHH = 010110100001101111011000</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Let&rsquo;s think about how we could <strong>apply this shift sequence</strong> to our color in order to encrypt it using the <strong>one-time pad</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>100111001011010100111010 + 010110100001101111011000 = ?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;To make the one-time pad work we need to choose the correct operation so that the resulting sequence is equally likely to be any color.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go over three different operations:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>AND</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <strong>AND</strong> operator is also known as <strong>logical conjunction</strong>, and works just like multiplication.&nbsp;<br />\n"
"It outputs a 1 <u>only if all of the inputs are 1</u>. Here is the truth table:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>0</strong> AND <strong>0</strong> = <strong>0</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>0</strong> AND <strong>1</strong> =&nbsp;<strong>0</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>1</strong> AND <strong>0</strong> = <strong>0</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>1</strong> AND <strong>1</strong> = <strong>1</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s try it:</strong>&nbsp;100111001011010100111010 <strong>AND</strong> 010110100001101111011000 = <strong>000110000001000100011000</strong></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>This results in a very dark purple. Notice when we perform the <strong>AND</strong> operation on any binary number, the resulting sequence <strong>cannot be larger</strong>. In our color example this eliminates many possible shades as it pushes the color <strong>towards black</strong>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>OR</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <strong>OR</strong> operator is also known as <strong>logical disjunction</strong>. It outputs a 1 whenever <u>one or more of its inputs are&nbsp;1</u>. Here is the truth table:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>0</strong> OR <strong>0</strong> = <strong>0</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>0</strong> OR <strong>1</strong> = <strong>1</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>1</strong> OR <strong>0</strong> = <strong>1</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>1</strong> OR <strong>1</strong> = <strong>1</strong></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>This results in a light purple. Notice when we perform the <strong>OR</strong> operation on any binary sequence, the resulting sequence <strong>cannot be smaller</strong>. This eliminates many possibilities as it pushes the color <strong>towards white</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>XOR</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The XOR operator outputs a 1&nbsp;whenever the inputs <u>do not match</u>, which occurs when one of the two inputs is <strong>exclusively true</strong>. This is the same as <a href=\"/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/modular-addition-and-subtraction\">addition mod 2</a>. Here is the truth table:&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>0</strong> XOR <strong>0</strong> = <strong>0</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>0</strong> XOR<strong> 1</strong> = <strong>1</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>1</strong> XOR <strong>0</strong> = <strong>1</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>1</strong> XOR <strong>1 </strong>= <strong>0</strong></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>This results in a slightly darker purple as compared to the OR operation.

"<p><strong>HTHTTHTHHHHTTHTTTTHTTHHH = 010110100001101111011000</strong></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;To make the one-time pad work we need to choose the correct operation so that the resulting sequence is equally likely to be any color.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go over three different operations:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>AND</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <strong>AND</strong> operator is also known as <strong>logical conjunction</strong>, and works just like multiplication.&nbsp;<br />\n"
"It outputs a 1 <u>only if all of the inputs are 1</u>. Here is the truth table:</p>\n"

"<p><strong>0</strong> AND <strong>0</strong> = <strong>0</strong></p>\n"

"<p><strong>0</strong> AND <strong>1</strong> =&nbsp;<strong>0</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>1</strong> AND <strong>0</strong> = <strong>0</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>1</strong> AND <strong>1</strong> = <strong>1</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s try it:</strong>&nbsp;100111001011010100111010 <strong>AND</strong> 010110100001101111011000 = <strong>000110000001000100011000</strong></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>This results in a very dark purple. Notice when we perform the <strong>AND</strong> operation on any binary number, the resulting sequence <strong>cannot be larger</strong>. In our color example this eliminates many possible shades as it pushes the color <strong>towards black</strong>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>OU</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <strong>OR</strong> operator is also known as <strong>logical disjunction</strong>. It outputs a 1 whenever <u>one or more of its inputs are&nbsp;1</u>. Here is the truth table:</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>This results in a light purple. Notice when we perform the <strong>OR</strong> operation on any binary sequence, the resulting sequence <strong>cannot be smaller</strong>. This eliminates many possibilities as it pushes the color <strong>towards white</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>XOR</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The XOR operator outputs a 1&nbsp;whenever the inputs <u>do not match</u>, which occurs when one of the two inputs is <strong>exclusively true</strong>. This is the same as <a href=\"/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/modular-addition-and-subtraction\">addition mod 2</a>. Here is the truth table:&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Between 1969 and 1972, German archaeologist, W.E. Wendt, researching in an area known locally as &quot;Goachanas,&quot; unearthed several painted slabs in a cave he named Apollo 11, after NASA&rsquo;s successful moon landing mission.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Seven painted stone slabs of brown-grey quartzite, depicting a variety of animals painted in charcoal, ochre and white, were located in a Middle Stone Age deposit&nbsp;(100,000&ndash;60,000 years ago). These images are not easily identifiable to species level, but have been interpreted variously as felines and/or bovids; one in particular has been observed to be either a zebra, giraffe or ostrich, demonstrating the ambiguous nature of the depictions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Art and our modern mind</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the Apollo 11 plaques may be the oldest discovered representational art in Africa, this is not the beginning of the story of art. It is now well-established, through genetic and fossil evidence, that anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) developed in Africa more than 100,000 years ago; of these, a small group left the Continent around 60,000-80,000 years ago and spread throughout the rest of the world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Recently discovered examples of patterned stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell, as well as evidence of personal ornamentation emerging from Middle Stone Age Africa, have demonstrated that &quot;art&quot;&nbsp;is not only a much older phenomenon than previously thought, but that it has its roots in the African continent. Africa is where we share a common humanity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first examples of what we might term &quot;art&quot;&nbsp;in Africa, dating from between 100,000&ndash;60,000 years ago, emerge in two very distinct forms: personal adornment in the form of perforated seashells suspended on twine, and incised and engraved stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell. Despite some sites being 8,000km and 40,000 years apart, an intriguing feature of the earliest art is that these first forays appear remarkably similar. It is worth noting here that the term &quot;art&quot;&nbsp;in this context is highly problematic, in that we cannot assume that humans living 100,000 years ago, or even 10,000 years ago, had a concept of art in the same way that we do, particularly in the modern Western sense. However, it remains a useful umbrella term for our purposes here.</p>\n"

"<p>The practice of engraving or incising, which emerges around 12,000 years ago in Saharan rock art, has its antecedents much earlier, up to 100,000 years ago. Incised and engraved stone, bone, ochre and ostrich eggshell have been found at sites in southern Africa. These marked objects share features in the expression of design, exhibiting patterns that have been classified as cross-hatching.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One of the most iconic and well-publicised sites that have yielded cross-hatch incised patterning on ochre is Blombos Cave, on the southern Cape shore of South Africa. Of the more than 8,500 fragments of ochre deriving from the MSA (Middle Stone AGe) levels, 15 fragments show evidence of engraving. Two of these, dated to 77,000 years ago, have received the most attention for the design of cross-hatch pattern.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For many archaeologists, the incised pieces of ochre at Blombos are the most complex and best-formed evidence for early abstract representations, and are unequivocal evidence for symbolic thought and language. The debate about when we became a symbolic species and acquired fully syntactical language &ndash; what archaeologists term &lsquo;modern human behaviour&rsquo; &ndash; is both complex and contested. It has been proposed that these cross-hatch patterns are clear evidence of thinking symbolically, because the motifs are not representational and as such are culturally constructed and arbitrary. Moreover, in order for the meaning of this motif to be conveyed to others, language is a prerequisite.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Blombos engravings are not isolated occurrences, since the presence of such designs occur at more than half a dozen other sites in South Africa, suggesting that this pattern is indeed important in some way, and not the result of idiosyncratic behaviour. It is worth noting, however, that for some scholars, the premise that the pattern is symbolic is not so certain. The patterns may indeed have a meaning, but it is how that meaning is associated, either by resemblance (iconic) or correlation (indexical), that is important for our understanding of human cognition.</p>\n"

"<p>The <em>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</em> is an anthropoid (human-shaped), painted terracotta sarcophagus found in the ancient Etruscan city of Caere (now Cerveteri, Italy). The sarcophagus, which would have originally contained cremated human remains, was discovered during the course of archaeological excavations in the Banditaccia necropolis of ancient Caere during the nineteenth century and is now in Rome. The sarcophagus is quite similar to another terracotta sarcophagus from Caere depicting a man and woman that is presently housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris; these two sarcophagi are contemporary to one another and are perhaps the products of the same artistic workshop.</p>\n"

The body of the sarcophagus is styled so as to resemble a&nbsp;kline&nbsp;(dining couch).&nbsp;Both figures have highly stylized hair, in each case plaited with the stylized braids hanging rather stiffly at the sides of the neck. In the female&rsquo;s case the plaits are arranged so as to hang down in front of each shoulder. The female wears a soft cap atop her head; she also wears shoes with pointed toes that are characteristically Etruscan. The male&rsquo;s braids hang neatly at the back, splayed across the upper back and shoulders. The male&rsquo;s beard and the hair atop his head is quite abstracted without any interior detail. Both figures have elongated proportions that are at home in the archaic period in the Mediterranean.</p>\n"

"<h3>A banquet</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The S<em>arcophagus of the Spouses</em> has been interpreted as belonging to a banqueting scene, with the couple reclining together on a single dining couch while eating and drinking. This situates the inspiration for the sarcophagus squarely in the convivial (social)&nbsp;sphere and, as we are often reminded, conviviality was central to Etruscan mortuary rituals. Etruscan funerary art&mdash;including painted tombs&mdash;often depicts scenes of revelry, perhaps as a reminder of the funeral banquet that would send the deceased off to the afterlife or perhaps to reflect the notion of perpetual conviviality in said afterlife.

"<p>The <em>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</em> is a masterwork of terracotta sculpture. Painted terracotta sculpture played a key role in the visual culture of archaic Etruria. Terracotta artwork was the standard for decorating the superstructure of Etruscan temples and the coroplastic (terracotta) workshops producing these sculptures often displayed a high level of technical achievement. This is due, in part, to the fact that ready sources of marble were unknown in archaic Italy. Even though contemporary Greeks produced masterworks in marble during the sixth century B.C.E., terracotta statuary such as this sarcophagus itself counts as a masterwork and would have been an elite commission.

"<p>The <em>Sarcophagus of the Spouses</em> is an anthropoid (human-shaped), painted terracotta sarcophagus found in the ancient Etruscan city of Caere (now Cerveteri, Italy). The sarcophagus, which would have originally contained cremated human remains, was discovered during the course of archaeological excavations in the Banditaccia necropolis of ancient Caere during the nineteenth century and is now in Rome. The sarcophagus is quite similar to another terracotta sarcophagus from Caere depicting a man and woman that is presently housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris; these two sarcophagi are contemporary to one another and are perhaps the products of the same artistic workshop.</p>\n"

"<h3>An archaic couple</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The sarcophagus depicts a reclining man and woman on its lid. The pair rests on highly stylized cushions, just as they would have done at an actual banquet. The body of the sarcophagus is styled so as to resemble a&nbsp;kline&nbsp;(dining couch).&nbsp;Both figures have highly stylized hair, in each case plaited with the stylized braids hanging rather stiffly at the sides of the neck. In the female&rsquo;s case the plaits are arranged so as to hang down in front of each shoulder. The female wears a soft cap atop her head; she also wears shoes with pointed toes that are characteristically Etruscan. The male&rsquo;s braids hang neatly at the back, splayed across the upper back and shoulders. The male&rsquo;s beard and the hair atop his head is quite abstracted without any interior detail. Both figures have elongated proportions that are at home in the archaic period in the Mediterranean.</p>\n"

"<h3>A banquet</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The S<em>arcophagus of the Spouses</em> has been interpreted as belonging to a banqueting scene, with the couple reclining together on a single dining couch while eating and drinking. This situates the inspiration for the sarcophagus squarely in the convivial (social)&nbsp;sphere and, as we are often reminded, conviviality was central to Etruscan mortuary rituals. Etruscan funerary art&mdash;including painted tombs&mdash;often depicts scenes of revelry, perhaps as a reminder of the funeral banquet that would send the deceased off to the afterlife or perhaps to reflect the notion of perpetual conviviality in said afterlife. Whatever the case, banquets provide a great deal of iconographic fodder for Etruscan artists.</p>\n"

"<h3>Forests of Stone</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Algeria is Africa&rsquo;s largest country and most of it falls within the Sahara Desert. It also hosts a rich rock art concentration. Most of the sites are found in the south east of the country near its borders with Libya and Niger but there are also important concentrations in the Algerian Maghreb and in the Hoggar Mountains in the central south.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most renowned of all these areas is the Tassili n&rsquo;Ajjer (meaning &quot;plateau of chasms&quot;) in the south east. Water and sand erosion have carved out a landscape of thin passageways, large arches, and high-pillared rocks, described as &ldquo;forests of stone&rdquo; by French archaeologist and ethnographer Henri Lhote. The resulting undercuts at cliff bases have created rock shelters with smooth walls ideal for painting and engraving (left).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Ajjer plateau rises to approximately 500-600 meters above the plain of Djanet, an oasis city, and capital of Djanet District, in Illizi Province, southeast Algeria. The region has been inhabited since Neolithic times, when the environment was much wetter and sustained a wider extent of flora and fauna as witnessed in the numerous rock paintings of Tassili n&#39;Ajjer. Classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982 and Biosphere Reserve in 1986, Tassili n&#39;Ajjer covers a vast area of desert landscape in southern Algeria, stretching from the Niger and Libyan border area, north and east of Djanet, as far as Illizi and Amguid, covering an area of 72,000 sq. km.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Subject matter</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More than 15,000 rock paintings and engravings, dating back as far as 12,000 years are located in this region and have made Tassili world famous for this reason. The art depicts herds of cattle and large wild animals such as giraffe and elephant, as well as human activities such as hunting and dancing. The area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings which were first described and published by Henri Lhote in the 1950s. Thought to date from around 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found on the African continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Although the styles and subjects of north African rock art vary, there are commonalities: images are most often figurative and frequently depict animals, both wild and domestic. There are also many images of human figures, sometimes with accessories such as recognisable weaponry or clothing. These may be painted or engraved, with frequent occurrences of both, at times in the same context. Engravings are generally more common, although this may simply be a preservation bias due to their greater durability.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The physical context of rock art sites varies depending on geographical and topographical factors&mdash;for example, Moroccan rock engravings are often found on open rocky outcrops, while Tunisia&rsquo;s Djebibina rock art sites have all been found in rock shelters. Rock art in the vast and harsh environments of the Sahara is often inaccessible and hard to find, and there is probably a great deal of rock art that is yet to be seen by archaeologists; what is known has mostly been documented within the last century.<br />\n"

The region has been inhabited since Neolithic times, when the environment was much wetter and sustained a wider extent of flora and fauna as witnessed in the numerous rock paintings of Tassili n&#39;Ajjer. Classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982 and Biosphere Reserve in 1986, Tassili n&#39;Ajjer covers a vast area of desert landscape in southern Algeria, stretching from the Niger and Libyan border area, north and east of Djanet, as far as Illizi and Amguid, covering an area of 72,000 sq. km.</p>\n"

"<p>The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Subject matter</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More than 15,000 rock paintings and engravings, dating back as far as 12,000 years are located in this region and have made Tassili world famous for this reason. The art depicts herds of cattle and large wild animals such as giraffe and elephant, as well as human activities such as hunting and dancing. The area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings which were first described and published by Henri Lhote in the 1950s. Thought to date from around 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found on the African continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height.</p>\n"

"<p>Although the styles and subjects of north African rock art vary, there are commonalities: images are most often figurative and frequently depict animals, both wild and domestic. There are also many images of human figures, sometimes with accessories such as recognisable weaponry or clothing. These may be painted or engraved, with frequent occurrences of both, at times in the same context. Engravings are generally more common, although this may simply be a preservation bias due to their greater durability.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The physical context of rock art sites varies depending on geographical and topographical factors&mdash;for example, Moroccan rock engravings are often found on open rocky outcrops, while Tunisia&rsquo;s Djebibina rock art sites have all been found in rock shelters. Rock art in the vast and harsh environments of the Sahara is often inaccessible and hard to find, and there is probably a great deal of rock art that is yet to be seen by archaeologists; what is known has mostly been documented within the last century.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>It seems strange now but for a while the art world turned its back on the German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Aside from being cursed with the label of Hitler&rsquo;s favourite artist, for much of the twentieth century the Impressionists, with their loose, painterly style, were held to be the fathers of modern art.

"\n"
"<p>Over the last few decades though the tide of opinion has turned. Now it is generally accepted that both in his technical brilliance and theoretically in his views of what the purpose of art should be, Friedrich was as radical as they come. But if proof were ever needed again of his credentials as one of the great forerunners of modern art, then <em>The Monk by the Sea </em>would have to be it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A new departure</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b6b8750b6d4f3e88d9971b7aadd4c1bd19a86836.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Friedrich, <em>Abbey Among Oak Trees,</em>&nbsp;1809 or 1810, oil on canvas, 110.4 x 171 cm&nbsp;(Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin)</span></span>Exhibited in the Academy in Berlin in 1810 along with its companion piece<em>&nbsp;Abbey Among Oak Trees</em>, it depicts a monk standing on the shore looking out to sea. The location has been identified as R&uuml;gen, an island off the north-east coast of Germany, a site he frequently painted.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monk is positioned a little over a third of the way into the painting from the left, to a ratio of around 1:1.6. The same ratio can be found frequently in Western art and is known variously as the golden ration, rule or section. Aside from this nod to tradition however there is little else about this painting that can be described as conventional.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The horizon line is unusually low and stretches uninterrupted from one end of the canvas to the other. The dark blue sea is flecked with white suggesting the threat of a storm. Above it in that turbulent middle section blue-grey clouds gather giving way in the highest part to a clearer, calmer blue. The transition from one to the other is achieved subtly through a technique called scumbling in which one colour is applied in thin layers on top of another to create an ill-defined, hazy effect.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The composition could not be further from typical German landscape paintings of the time. These generally followed the principles of a style imported from England known as the picturesque which tended to employ well-established perspectival techniques designed to draw the viewer into the picture; devices such as trees situated in the foreground or rivers winding their course, snake- like, into the distance. Friedrich however deliberately shunned such tricks. Such wilfully unconventional decisions in a painting of this size provoked consternation among contemporary viewers, as his friend Heinrich von Kleist famously wrote: &ldquo;Since it has, in its uniformity and boundlessness, no foreground but the frame, it is as if one&rsquo;s eyelids had been cut off.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The monk</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is some debate as to who that strange figure, curved like a question mark, actually is. Some think it Friedrich himself, others the poet and theological Gotthard Ludwig Kosegarten who served as a pastor on R&uuml;gen and was known to give sermons on the shore. Kosegarten&rsquo;s writings certainly influenced the painting. Von Kleist, for example, refers to its &ldquo;Kosegarten effect&rdquo;. &nbsp;According to this pastor-poet nature, like the Bible, is a book through which God reveals Himself. &nbsp;God reveals Himself. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/18bd270942bf569f68c1cd578ea17b7cfccf093c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Monk (detail), Caspar David Friedrich, <em>Monk by the Sea,</em> c. 1809&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Similarly, stripping it of any literal Christian symbolism, Friedrich instead concentrates on the power of the natural climate and so charges the landscape with a divine authority, one which seems to all but subsume the figure of the monk. With nothing but land, sea and sky to measure him by, his physical presence is rendered fragile and hauntingly ambiguous.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The R&uuml;ckenfigur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Originally the figure was looking to the right. &nbsp;His feet still point in that direction. Friedrich altered this at some point, having him look out to sea. The technique of positioning a figure with their back towards the viewer is often found in Friedrich&#39;s art<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c79f5199a147630f98e2371d411ac5fdbb38c10a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Caspar David Friedrich, <em>Wanderer above the Sea of Fog</em>, 1818, oil on canvas, 37.3&nbsp;&times; 29.4 inches/&nbsp;98.4 cm &times; 74.8 cm, (Kunsthalle Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany)</span></span>; the German word for it is the r&uuml;ckenfigur.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>Monk by the Sea</em>, the first instance of it in his work, is somewhat atypical in that the monk being so small and situated so low on the horizon does not &lsquo;oversee&rsquo; the landscape the way Friedrich&rsquo;s ruck&euml;nfiguren generally do.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The technique is much more complex and intellectually challenging than those found in the picturesque. Acting as a visual cue, the figure draws us into the painting, prompting us, challenging us even, to follow its example and simply look. And so we do. Yet its presence also obscures our line of vision and rather than enhancing the view in the end disrupts it. &nbsp;In this sense, the ruck&euml;nfigur while reminding us of the infinite beauty of the world also points to our inability to experience it fully, a contradiction that we often find expressed in German Romantic art and literature.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A political statement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s army was occupying Prussia when the painting was completed and art historians have naturally looked to read the painting and its companion, which depicts of a funeral procession in a ruined abbey, as a comment on the French occupation. It would have been dangerous to be openly critical of Napoleon&rsquo;s forces so the paintings&rsquo; political messages are subtly coded.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Both paintings were purchased by the young Crown Prince, Frederick William, whose mother, Queen Louise, had died a few months earlier at the age of 34. An extremely popular figure, she had pleaded with Napoleon after his victory to treat the Prussian people fairly. Her death surely would have been fresh in people&rsquo;s minds when they saw the paintings, a tragic loss which was very much associated with the country&rsquo;s own defeat by the French.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The presence of death is certainly felt in <em>The Monk by the Sea</em>, though in the monk&rsquo;s resolute figure we also find a source of spiritual strength, defiance even,&nbsp;standing, like that gothic abbey and those German oaks in its pendant, as much perhaps a symbol of the resolve of the nation against the foreign military rule, as&nbsp;of the individual faced with his mortality.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Romantic</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like Constable, Friedrich drew on the natural world around him, often returning to the same area again and again. Unlike the English painter&rsquo;s more scientific or naturalist approach, though, Friedrich condensed the image so as to communicate an exact emotion. As he put it, &ldquo;a painter should paint not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within himself.&rdquo; It is this inward reaching project, using colour and form to reveal emotional truths, that singles him out as one of the greatest and most innovative painters of his age: a true Romantic.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>About carpets</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are among the most fundamental of Islamic arts. Portable, typically made of silk and wools, carpets were traded and sold across the Islamic lands and beyond its boundaries to Europe and China. Those from Iran were highly prized. Carpets decorated the floors of mosques, shrines and homes, but they could also be hung on walls of houses to preserve warmth in the winter.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ardabil and a 14th century Saint</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The carpet takes its name from the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran. Ardabil was the home to the shrine of the Sufi saint, Safi al-Din Ardabili, who died in 1334 (Sufism is Islamic mysticism). He was a Sufi leader who trained his followers in Islamic mystic practices. After his death, his following grew and his descendents became increasingly powerful. In 1501 one of his descendents, Shah Isma&rsquo;il, seized power, united Iran, and established Shi&rsquo;a Islam as the official religion. The dynasty he founded is known as the Safavids. Their rule, which lasted until 1722, was one of the most important periods for Islamic art, especially for textiles and for manuscripts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Made for a shrine&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Plan of the shrine at Ardabil, showing where the carpets were situated (permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4e3d4042f01060ec790cbdbbaa10a10f195823a2.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plan of the shrine at Ardabil, showing where the carpets were situated (permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) </span></span>This carpet was one of a matching pair that was made for the shrine of Safi al-Din Ardabili when it was enlarged in the late 1530s. Today the Ardabil carpet dominates the main Islamic Art Gallery in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, while its twin is in the LA County Museum of Art. The carpets were located side by side in the shrine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The pile of the carpet is made from wool, rather than silk because it holds dye better. The knot-count of a carpet still directly impacts the value of carpets today; the more knots per square centimeter, the more detailed and elaborate the patterns can be. The dyes used to color the carpet are natural&nbsp;and include pomegrante rind and indigo. Up to ten weavers could have worked on the carpet at any given time. The Ardabil carpet has 340 knots per square inch (5300 knots per ten centimeters square). Today, a commercial rug averages 80-160 knots per square inch, meaning that the Ardabil carpet was highly detailed. Its high knot count allowed for the inclusion of an intricate design and pattern. It is not known whether the carpet was produced in a royal workshop, but there is evidence for court workshop in the 15th and 16th centuries. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Ardabil Carpet, detail\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2328b1ad3ad692f83b5061730c424ddb845b4ead.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ardabil Carpet (detail)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Design and Pattern</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The rich geometric patterns, vegetative scrolls, floral flourishes, so typical of Islamic art, reach a fever pitch in this remarkable carpet, encouraging the viewer to walk around and around, trying to absorb every detail of design.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>That the design of the carpet was not arbitrary or piecemeal, but was well-organized and thoughtful can be seen throughout. Considering the immense size of the carpet&mdash;10.51m x 5.34m (34&#39; 6&quot; x 17&#39; 6&quot;)&mdash;this is impressive. A central golden medallion dominates the carpet; it is surrounded by a ring of multi-colored, detailed ovals. Lamps appear to hang at either end.</span></p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"

"<h3>An inscription&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Ardabil Carpet includes a four-line inscription placed at one end. This short poem is vital for understanding who commissioned the carpet and the date of the carpet.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first three lines of poetry reads:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for me in all the world.<br />\n"
"<span>Except for this door there is no resting-place for my head.</span><br />\n"
"<span>The work of the slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani.</span></p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Maqsud was probably the court official charged with producing the carpets. By referring to himself as a slave, he may be presenting himself as a humble servant. The Persian word for a door can be used to denote a shrine or royal court, so this inscription may imply that the royal court patronized the shrine. The carpets would have probably taken four years to make.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The fourth line of the inscription is also important. It provides the date of the carpet, AH 946. The Muslim calendar begins in the year 620 CE when Muhammad fled from Mecca to Medina; this year is known as the year of the Hijra or flight (in Latin anno hegirae). AH 946 is equivalent to 1539/40 CE (the lunar Muslim calendar does not exactly match the Gregorian Calendar, used in the west).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of the Ardabil carpet and its skillful execution is a testament to the great skill of the artisans at work in north-west Iran in the 1530s.</p>\n"

"<p>Many great treasures from around the world have legally made their way into the collections of western museums. Many objects were legally purchased by collectors and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries; however, many works of art are still illegally exported and sold.

"\n"
"<h3>About carpets</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are among the most fundamental of Islamic arts. Portable, typically made of silk and wools, carpets were traded and sold across the Islamic lands and beyond its boundaries to Europe and China. Those from Iran were highly prized. Carpets decorated the floors of mosques, shrines and homes, but they could also be hung on walls of houses to preserve warmth in the winter.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ardabil and a 14th century Saint</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The carpet takes its name from the town of Ardabil in north-west Iran. Ardabil was the home to the shrine of the Sufi saint, Safi al-Din Ardabili, who died in 1334 (Sufism is Islamic mysticism). He was a Sufi leader who trained his followers in Islamic mystic practices. After his death, his following grew and his descendents became increasingly powerful. In 1501 one of his descendents, Shah Isma&rsquo;il, seized power, united Iran, and established Shi&rsquo;a Islam as the official religion. The dynasty he founded is known as the Safavids. Their rule, which lasted until 1722, was one of the most important periods for Islamic art, especially for textiles and for manuscripts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Made for a shrine&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Plan of the shrine at Ardabil, showing where the carpets were situated (permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4e3d4042f01060ec790cbdbbaa10a10f195823a2.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plan of the shrine at Ardabil, showing where the carpets were situated (permission, Victoria and Albert Museum) </span></span>This carpet was one of a matching pair that was made for the shrine of Safi al-Din Ardabili when it was enlarged in the late 1530s. Today the Ardabil carpet dominates the main Islamic Art Gallery in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, while its twin is in the LA County Museum of Art. The carpets were located side by side in the shrine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The pile of the carpet is made from wool, rather than silk because it holds dye better. The knot-count of a carpet still directly impacts the value of carpets today; the more knots per square centimeter, the more detailed and elaborate the patterns can be. The dyes used to color the carpet are natural&nbsp;and include pomegrante rind and indigo. Up to ten weavers could have worked on the carpet at any given time. The Ardabil carpet has 340 knots per square inch (5300 knots per ten centimeters square). Today, a commercial rug averages 80-160 knots per square inch, meaning that the Ardabil carpet was highly detailed. Its high knot count allowed for the inclusion of an intricate design and pattern. It is not known whether the carpet was produced in a royal workshop, but there is evidence for court workshop in the 15th and 16th centuries. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Design and Pattern</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The rich geometric patterns, vegetative scrolls, floral flourishes, so typical of Islamic art, reach a fever pitch in this remarkable carpet, encouraging the viewer to walk around and around, trying to absorb every detail of design.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>That the design of the carpet was not arbitrary or piecemeal, but was well-organized and thoughtful can be seen throughout. Considering the immense size of the carpet&mdash;10.51m x 5.34m (34&#39; 6&quot; x 17&#39; 6&quot;)&mdash;this is impressive. A central golden medallion dominates the carpet; it is surrounded by a ring of multi-colored, detailed ovals. Lamps appear to hang at either end.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>The Dutch Civic Guard&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rembrandt&rsquo;s <em>Night Watch</em> is an example of a very specific type of painting that was exclusive to the Northern Netherlands, with the majority&nbsp;being commissioned in the city of Amsterdam. &nbsp;It is a group portrait of a company of civic guardsmen. The primary purpose of these guardsmen was to serve as defenders of their cities. &nbsp;As such, they were tasked with guarding gates, policing streets, putting out fires, and generally maintaining order throughout the city. &nbsp;Additionally, they were an important presence at parades held for visiting royalty as well and other festive occasions. &nbsp;Each company had its own guild hall as well as a shooting range where they could practice with the specific weapon associated with their group, either a longbow, a crossbow, or a firearm. &nbsp;According to tradition, these assembly halls were decorated with group portraits of its most distinguished members, which served not only to record the likenesses of these citizens, but more importantly to assert the power and individuality of the city that they defended. &nbsp;In short, these images helped promote a sense of pride and civic duty.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Rembrandt was at the height of his career when he received the commission to paint the <em>Night Watch</em> for the <em>Kloveniersdoelen</em>, the guild hall that housed the Amsterdam civic guard company of arquebusiers, or musketeers. &nbsp;This company was under the command of Captain Frans Banning Cocq, who holds a prominent position in the center foreground of the image (above left). He wears the formal black attire and white lace collar of the upper class, accented by a bold red sash across his chest. At his waist is a rapier and in his hand a baton, the latter of which identifies his military rank. Striding forward, he turns his head to the left and emphatically extends his free hand as he addresses his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburgh, who turns to acknowledge his orders. &nbsp;He is also fancifully dressed, but in bright yellow, his military role referenced by the steel gorget he wears around his neck and the strongly foreshortened ceremonial partisan that he carries. &nbsp;Sixteen additional portraits of members of this company are also included, with the names of all inscribed on a framed shield in the archway.&nbsp;As was common practice at the time, sitters paid a fee that was based on their prominence within the painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

A great deal of energy is generated as these citizens spring to action in response to their captain&rsquo;s command. &nbsp;Indeed, the scene has the appearance of an actual historical event taking place although what we are truly witnessing is the creative genius of Rembrandt at work. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Men wearing bits of armor and varied helmets, arm themselves with an array of weapons before a massive, but imaginary archway that acts as a symbol of the city gate to be defended. &nbsp;On the left, the standard bearer raises the troop banner while on the far right a group of men hold their pikes high. &nbsp;In the left foreground, a young boy carrying a powder horn dashes off to collect more powder for the musketeers. &nbsp;Opposite him, a drummer taps out a cadence while a dog barks enthusiastically at his feet. &nbsp;</p>\n"

Most of these figures are relegated to the background with their faces obscured or only partly visible.&nbsp;One, wearing a beret and peering up from behind the helmeted figure standing next to the standard bearer has even been identified as Rembrandt himself. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Three Musketeers&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While a number of different weapons are included in the painting, the most prominent weapon is the musket, the official weapon of the Kloveniers. &nbsp;Three of the five musketeers are given a place of significance just behind the captain and lieutenant where they carry out in sequential order the basic steps involved in properly handling a musket. &nbsp;First, on the left, a musketeer dressed all in red, charges his weapon by pouring powder into the muzzle. Next, a rather small figure wearing a helmet adorned with oak leaves fires his weapon to the right. &nbsp;Finally, the man behind the lieutenant clears the pan by blowing off the residual powder (both the figure in a helmet with oak leaves and the man blowing off the powder are visible in the detail of the central figures above). In his rendering of these steps, it seems that Rembrandt was influenced by weapons manuals of the period.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Her most curious attribute, however, is the large white chicken that hangs upside down from her waistband. The significance of this bird, particularly its claws, lies in its direct reference to the Kloveniers. Each guild had its own emblem and for the Kloveniers it was a golden claw on a blue field. The girl then is not a real person, but acts as a personification of the company.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Dutch Civic Guard&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rembrandt&rsquo;s <em>Night Watch</em> is an example of a very specific type of painting that was exclusive to the Northern Netherlands, with the majority&nbsp;being commissioned in the city of Amsterdam. &nbsp;It is a group portrait of a company of civic guardsmen. The primary purpose of these guardsmen was to serve as defenders of their cities. &nbsp;As such, they were tasked with guarding gates, policing streets, putting out fires, and generally maintaining order throughout the city. &nbsp;Additionally, they were an important presence at parades held for visiting royalty as well and other festive occasions. &nbsp;Each company had its own guild hall as well as a shooting range where they could practice with the specific weapon associated with their group, either a longbow, a crossbow, or a firearm. &nbsp;According to tradition, these assembly halls were decorated with group portraits of its most distinguished members, which served not only to record the likenesses of these citizens, but more importantly to assert the power and individuality of the city that they defended. &nbsp;In short, these images helped promote a sense of pride and civic duty.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Rembrandt was at the height of his career when he received the commission to paint the <em>Night Watch</em> for the <em>Kloveniersdoelen</em>, the guild hall that housed the Amsterdam civic guard company of arquebusiers, or musketeers. &nbsp;This company was under the command of Captain Frans Banning Cocq, who holds a prominent position in the center foreground of the image (above left). He wears the formal black attire and white lace collar of the upper class, accented by a bold red sash across his chest. At his waist is a rapier and in his hand a baton, the latter of which identifies his military rank. Striding forward, he turns his head to the left and emphatically extends his free hand as he addresses his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburgh, who turns to acknowledge his orders. &nbsp;He is also fancifully dressed, but in bright yellow, his military role referenced by the steel gorget he wears around his neck and the strongly foreshortened ceremonial partisan that he carries. &nbsp;Sixteen additional portraits of members of this company are also included, with the names of all inscribed on a framed shield in the archway.&nbsp;As was common practice at the time, sitters paid a fee that was based on their prominence within the painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"

A great deal of energy is generated as these citizens spring to action in response to their captain&rsquo;s command. &nbsp;Indeed, the scene has the appearance of an actual historical event taking place although what we are truly witnessing is the creative genius of Rembrandt at work. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Men wearing bits of armor and varied helmets, arm themselves with an array of weapons before a massive, but imaginary archway that acts as a symbol of the city gate to be defended. &nbsp;On the left, the standard bearer raises the troop banner while on the far right a group of men hold their pikes high. &nbsp;In the left foreground, a young boy carrying a powder horn dashes off to collect more powder for the musketeers. &nbsp;Opposite him, a drummer taps out a cadence while a dog barks enthusiastically at his feet. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

Most of these figures are relegated to the background with their faces obscured or only partly visible.&nbsp;One, wearing a beret and peering up from behind the helmeted figure standing next to the standard bearer has even been identified as Rembrandt himself. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Three Musketeers&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While a number of different weapons are included in the painting, the most prominent weapon is the musket, the official weapon of the Kloveniers. &nbsp;Three of the five musketeers are given a place of significance just behind the captain and lieutenant where they carry out in sequential order the basic steps involved in properly handling a musket. &nbsp;First, on the left, a musketeer dressed all in red, charges his weapon by pouring powder into the muzzle. Next, a rather small figure wearing a helmet adorned with oak leaves fires his weapon to the right. &nbsp;Finally, the man behind the lieutenant clears the pan by blowing off the residual powder (both the figure in a helmet with oak leaves and the man blowing off the powder are visible in the detail of the central figures above). In his rendering of these steps, it seems that Rembrandt was influenced by weapons manuals of the period.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Golden Girl</h3>\n"

Her most curious attribute, however, is the large white chicken that hangs upside down from her waistband. The significance of this bird, particularly its claws, lies in its direct reference to the Kloveniers. Each guild had its own emblem and for the Kloveniers it was a golden claw on a blue field. The girl then is not a real person, but acts as a personification of the company.</p>\n"

"<p>Southwell Minster in Nottinghamshire, England, is not as famous as some of Britain&rsquo;s other great medieval churches, and neither is it as large. However, it presents superb examples of both Romanesque or Norman and Gothic architecture in a building that suffered little damage during the turbulent years of the British Reformation, Civil War, and World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Construction of the current church building was begun circa 1108, and was essentially completed around 50 years later. The basic layout for churches at that time was the shape of a cross, with the east end as the top, the transepts making the crossing arm, and the nave as the longer extension at the bottom of the cross. The east end held the altar and choir, or quire, which were used by the clergy during daily masses. The nave was accessible to the lay community. Although medieval British churches are basically oriented east to west, they all vary slightly. When a new church was to be built, the patron saint was selected and the altar location laid out. On the saint&rsquo;s day, a line would be surveyed from the position of the rising sun through the altar site and extending in a westerly direction. This was the orientation of the new building.&nbsp;</p>\n"

In addition to any possible&nbsp;European architectural forerunners, one must also consider Mesoamerican precedents.

Another example of the fusion of Christian and indigenous spiritual meaning is presented by the pyramidal shape of the chapels&rsquo; roofs, which were surmounted by highly ornate crosses. Crosses were important symbols for water, fertility, and sustenance prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. Non-Christian, pre-Columbian crosses were often created out of trees and represented the Tree of Life in various rituals. In mission spaces such as Huejotzingo, crosses became a powerful symbol for the source of spiritual life shared by Europeans and indigenous peoples alike. They were placed in the center of monastery atriums as a symbol of the Christian and indigenous <em>axis mundis </em>(world axis). The crosses that topped the posas, of which only the example from below survives, were modeled with similar didactic functions as the large atrium crosses that decorated most sixteenth-century missions in this region.

From around 1912, goldfish became a recurring subject in the work of Henri Matisse. They appear in no less than nine of his paintings, as well as in his drawings and prints. <em>Goldfish</em>, 1912 belongs to a series that Matisse produced between spring and early summer 1912. However, unlike the others, the focus here centers on the fish themselves.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Color</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The goldfish immediately attract our attention due to their color. The bright orange strongly contrasts with the more subtle pinks and greens that surround the fish bowl and the blue-green background. Blue and orange, as well as green and red, are complementary colors and, when placed next to one another, appear even brighter. This technique was used extensively by the Fauves, and is particularly striking in Matisse&rsquo;s earlier canvas <em>Le Bonheur de vivre</em>. Although he subsequently softened his palette, the bold orange is reminiscent of Matisse&rsquo;s fauvist years, which continued to influence his use of color throughout his career.</p>\n"

Henri Matisse painted it at home, in Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris. Matisse had moved to Issy in September 1909 to escape the pressures of Parisian life. So what you see here are Matisse&rsquo;s own plants, his own garden furniture, and his own fish tank. The artist was drawn to the tank&rsquo;s tall cylindrical shape, as this enabled him to create a succession of rounded contours with the top and bottom of the tank, the surface of the water and the table. Matisse also found the goldfish themselves visually appealing. Matisse painted <em>Goldfish</em> in his garden conservatory, where, like the goldfish, he was surrounded by glass.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Contemplation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Matisse distinguished predatory observation from disinterested contemplation, the latter being his preferred approach. <em>Goldfish</em> invites the viewer to indulge in the pleasure of watching the graceful movement and bright colors of the fish. Matisse once wrote that he dreamt of &ldquo;an art of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter, an art that could be [&hellip;] a soothing, calming influence on the mind, something like a good armchair that provides relaxation from fatigue.&rdquo; This is precisely what Matisse wanted <em>Goldfish</em> to provide for the viewer.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Constructing pictorial space</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting contains a tension created by Matisse&rsquo;s depiction of space. The fish are seen simultaneously from two different angles. From the front, the goldfish are portrayed in such a way that the details of their fins, eyes and mouths are immediately recognizable to the viewer. Seen from above, however, the goldfish are merely suggested by colorful brushstrokes. If we then look at the plants through the transparent glass surface, we notice that they are distorted compared to the &lsquo;real&rsquo; plants in the background.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Matisse paints the plants and flowers in a decorative manner. The upper section of the picture, above the fish tank, resembles a patterned wallpaper composed of flattened shapes and colors. What is more, the table-top is tilted upwards, flattening it and making it difficult for us to imagine how the goldfish and flowerpots actually manage to remain on the table. Matisse constructed this original juxtaposition of viewpoints and spatial ambiguity by observing Paul C&eacute;zanne&rsquo;s still-life paintings. C&eacute;zanne described art as &ldquo;a harmony parallel to nature&rdquo;. And it is clear here that although Matisse was attentive to nature, he did not imitate it but used his image of it to reassemble his own pictorial reality. Although this can be confusing for the viewer, Matisse&rsquo;s masterful use of color and pattern successfully holds everything together.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This painting is an illustration of some of the major themes in Matisse&rsquo;s painting: his use of complimentary colors, his quest for an idyllic paradise, his appeal for contemplative relaxation for the viewer and his complex construction of pictorial space.</p>\n"

From around 1912, goldfish became a recurring subject in the work of Henri Matisse. They appear in no less than nine of his paintings, as well as in his drawings and prints. <em>Goldfish</em>, 1912 belongs to a series that Matisse produced between spring and early summer 1912. However, unlike the others, the focus here centers on the fish themselves.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Color</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The goldfish immediately attract our attention due to their color. The bright orange strongly contrasts with the more subtle pinks and greens that surround the fish bowl and the blue-green background. Blue and orange, as well as green and red, are complementary colors and, when placed next to one another, appear even brighter. This technique was used extensively by the Fauves, and is particularly striking in Matisse&rsquo;s earlier canvas <em>Le Bonheur de vivre</em>. Although he subsequently softened his palette, the bold orange is reminiscent of Matisse&rsquo;s fauvist years, which continued to influence his use of color throughout his career.</p>\n"

"<p>And the winner of &ldquo;Miss Arte Italiana&rdquo; is&mdash;drum roll please&mdash;Antonio Canova&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious</em>! Or so, at least, is what a recent poll&nbsp;carried&nbsp;out for the Marilena Ferrari Foundation decided.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5a0b74d6d1d72a6d06aa4d30ac72b6f4fa695a4f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Antonio Canova, <em>Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious</em>, 1804-08, white marble, 160 x 192 cm (Galleria Borghese, Rome)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;Miss Italian Art,&rdquo;&nbsp;a cringeworthy epithet perhaps, but one which, given the&nbsp;strength of the competition, is nothing to sneeze at&mdash;works by Botticelli,&nbsp;Leonardo and Titian were also in contention.&nbsp;Certainly, the semi-nude, life-size portrait of Napoleon&rsquo;s wayward sister is a&nbsp;sumptuous work of art. Four years in the making, it was commissioned by&nbsp;Paolina&rsquo;s second husband, the Italian prince, Camillo Borghese, shortly after&nbsp;their marriage in 1804, a union designed to help Napoleon realise his dreams of&nbsp;establishing a pan-European dynasty and legitimize his claims to the Kingdom of&nbsp;Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Canova and Neoclassicism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anotonio Canova was a leading light of the Neoclassical movement. The style,&nbsp;influenced by the archeological discoveries in Pompeii and Herculaneum as&nbsp;well as the theories of the art historian Johann Wincklemann, looked back to the&nbsp;artistic achievements of the Greeks and Romans with renewed interest, informed&nbsp;by the spirit of rational enquiry that characterized the Age of Enlightenment.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As Inspector General of Antiquities and Fine Art of the Papal States and&nbsp;responsible for acquiring works for the Vatican museums, Canova would have&nbsp;known his Phidias from his Praxiteles. However, he was no slavish imitator.&nbsp;Instead he wished to emulate the works of these earlier artists.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fae8d4becdcb71c46cc56998815b5317ca44f65a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Nineteenth century French engraving of Canova, N<em>apoleon as Mars the Peacemaker</em>, 1802-1806, 325 cm&nbsp;(Wellington Museum, Apsley House, London)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The methods he used demanded absolute precision. Working from numerous&nbsp;preparatory sketches he modelled the form into a life-size clay version. He&nbsp;then cast a plaster model of this which he marked up with points that were&nbsp;transferred on to the marble block. His assistants would carve the marble into&nbsp;shape and only then, for &ldquo;the last hand,&rdquo;&nbsp;did Canova raise his chisel, sculpting the&nbsp;form and crucially polishing the marble, using wax, to a fine, glistening finish.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of his models were great personalities of the age. Canova would portray&nbsp;them in antique costume. This classicizing of contemporary figures verged&nbsp;sometimes on the ridiculous, as in the colossal nude sculpture of&nbsp;<em>Napoleon as&nbsp;Mars the Peacemaker.</em>&nbsp;His portrait of Paolina Borghese is more successful.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A modern day Venus</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Paolina is shown reclining on a pillowed couch in a pose of studied grace, both&nbsp;concentrated and relaxed. The modelling of the nude body is extraordinarily&nbsp;lifelike, while Canova&rsquo;s treatment of the surface of the marble captures the soft&nbsp;texture of skin. The tactile quality of the piece is bought out particularly in the&nbsp;way the sitter&rsquo;s own hands are occupied, the fingers of her right connecting&nbsp;ever so lightly with the nape of her neck, offer a gesture charged with seductive&nbsp;promise. The head is raised slightly suggesting that something or someone has&nbsp;suddenly entered her line of vision. The apple she holds in her left hand, her&nbsp;fingers wrapped around it suggestive of erotic touch, identifies her as Venus&nbsp;Victorious, the goddess awarded the Golden Apple of Discord in perhaps the&nbsp;first beauty competition in the history of Western culture. The story comes from&nbsp;ancient Greece. Paris the Trojan prince judged Venus more beautiful than either&nbsp;of her rivals, Minerva and Juno. In return Venus introduced him to a Greek girl&nbsp;called Helen and the rest of course is the stuff of epic poetry.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/49cff0573a8ea4fb6b0e97635d9e0065f5707419.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Antonio Canova, detail <em>Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious</em>, 1804-08, white marble, 160 x 192 cm (Galleria Borghese, Rome)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Originally, Canova was to depict her as Diana, the chaste goddess of the moon&nbsp;and the hunt, a role that more would have require her to have been clothed.&nbsp;Paolina insisted on Venus, though. A bit of a loose cannon with a reputation&nbsp;for promiscuity, the Emperor&rsquo;s sister enjoyed courting controversy and posing&nbsp;naked would certainly have raised a few eyebrows in polite society. But there&nbsp;was more to it than that. Apparently, the Borghese family believed themselves&nbsp;to be descended from the heroic founder of Rome, Aeneas, who according to&nbsp;Virgil was the son of Venus. The choice then not only suited Paolina&#39;s flirtatious&nbsp;character, but also would have been met with approval by the Borghese family,&nbsp;suggesting continuity between the ancient and modern worlds.&nbsp;Her&nbsp;hair, a mass of curls bound in a Psyche knot, serves as a visual connector&nbsp;between the two, being worn in imitation of ancient Greek styles as was the&nbsp;fashion of the day. Its careful articulation offsets the smooth shallow planes of&nbsp;her torso.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/06728a1fc32f99299a23a997487f9d668b8ca88b.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Antonio Canova, detail&nbsp;<em>Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious,</em> 1804-08, white marble, 160 x 192 cm (Galleria Borghese, Rome)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Creating a contrast of another sort, the couch Paolina lies on is carved from&nbsp;a different type of marble, the base part of which is covered in rhythmically&nbsp;flowing drapery, much like on a catafalque, a raised platform used to bear coffins.&nbsp;The allusion to mortuary art is not that surprising; in Greek and Roman art the&nbsp;reclining female figure is frequently found on sarcophagus lids. So conspicuous&nbsp;an allusion demands further explanation, though, and I suppose if one were&nbsp;forced to read for a meaning here it would have to be the defeat of death by&nbsp;beauty &ndash; as expressed through art &ndash; that is being celebrated in the image.</p>\n"

Literally animated, the sculpture would have been on a&nbsp;revolving mechanism, allowing the static viewer to see the work in the round. It&nbsp;would also have been viewed by candlelight. The finely polished waxy surface&nbsp;would have reflected light brilliantly, creating chiaroscuoro, a more painterly&nbsp;than sculptural effect, perhaps, but then Canova was a painterly sculptor. Paolina&nbsp;owes more to the likes of Giorgione&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Sleeping Venus</em>&nbsp;and Titian&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Venus of Urbino</em>&nbsp;and of course David&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Madame Recamier</em>&nbsp;than antique sculpture, a point not&nbsp;lost on the Neo-classical purists of the day who condemned the work as out of&nbsp;keeping with their austere classical theories.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Inevitably the sculpture was going to cause a scandal. While intended for a&nbsp;private audience sophisticated enough to appreciate the classical allusions, given&nbsp;Paolina&rsquo;s infidelities, the sculpture also served to confirm the rumours about her.&nbsp;If anything, though, Paolina enjoyed the attention. Asked if she minded having to&nbsp;pose nude, she replied: &ldquo;Why should I? The studio was heated.&rdquo; Camillo refused&nbsp;to allow the sculpture to leave his residence. Napoleon agreed.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>From Ingres to Renoir, from Proudhon to Puvis de Chavannes, <em>Paolina Borghese&nbsp;as Venus Victorious</em> had an enormous impact on nineteenth century French&nbsp;artists. It is in the works of the English sculptor John Gibson, though, who Canova&nbsp;took under his wing later on in life, that we find her most faithful devotee.&nbsp;Animating the figure with pools of reflected light, the glistening waxy surface&nbsp;of his most celebrated work&nbsp;<em>The Tinted Venus</em>&nbsp;owes much to&nbsp;<em>Venus Victorious</em>;&nbsp;together with his own innovative use of polychromy the sculpture provoked&nbsp;outrage among its Victorian audience for whom it appeared a little too real: &ldquo;a&nbsp;naked, impudent English woman&rdquo; as one review put her. Canova&rsquo;s own naked,&nbsp;impudent French woman would have been proud.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;Miss Italian Art,&rdquo;&nbsp;a cringeworthy epithet perhaps, but one which, given the&nbsp;strength of the competition, is nothing to sneeze at&mdash;works by Botticelli,&nbsp;Leonardo and Titian were also in contention.&nbsp;Certainly, the semi-nude, life-size portrait of Napoleon&rsquo;s wayward sister is a&nbsp;sumptuous work of art. Four years in the making, it was commissioned by&nbsp;Paolina&rsquo;s second husband, the Italian prince, Camillo Borghese, shortly after&nbsp;their marriage in 1804, a union designed to help Napoleon realise his dreams of&nbsp;establishing a pan-European dynasty and legitimize his claims to the Kingdom of&nbsp;Italy.</p>\n"

"<h3>Canova and Neoclassicism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Anotonio Canova was a leading light of the Neoclassical movement. The style,&nbsp;influenced by the archeological discoveries in Pompeii and Herculaneum as&nbsp;well as the theories of the art historian Johann Wincklemann, looked back to the&nbsp;artistic achievements of the Greeks and Romans with renewed interest, informed&nbsp;by the spirit of rational enquiry that characterized the Age of Enlightenment.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As Inspector General of Antiquities and Fine Art of the Papal States and&nbsp;responsible for acquiring works for the Vatican museums, Canova would have&nbsp;known his Phidias from his Praxiteles. However, he was no slavish imitator.&nbsp;Instead he wished to emulate the works of these earlier artists.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fae8d4becdcb71c46cc56998815b5317ca44f65a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Nineteenth century French engraving of Canova, N<em>apoleon as Mars the Peacemaker</em>, 1802-1806, 325 cm&nbsp;(Wellington Museum, Apsley House, London)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The methods he used demanded absolute precision. Working from numerous&nbsp;preparatory sketches he modelled the form into a life-size clay version. He&nbsp;then cast a plaster model of this which he marked up with points that were&nbsp;transferred on to the marble block. His assistants would carve the marble into&nbsp;shape and only then, for &ldquo;the last hand,&rdquo;&nbsp;did Canova raise his chisel, sculpting the&nbsp;form and crucially polishing the marble, using wax, to a fine, glistening finish.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of his models were great personalities of the age. Canova would portray&nbsp;them in antique costume. This classicizing of contemporary figures verged&nbsp;sometimes on the ridiculous, as in the colossal nude sculpture of&nbsp;<em>Napoleon as&nbsp;Mars the Peacemaker.</em>&nbsp;His portrait of Paolina Borghese is more successful.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A modern day Venus</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Paolina is shown reclining on a pillowed couch in a pose of studied grace, both&nbsp;concentrated and relaxed. The modelling of the nude body is extraordinarily&nbsp;lifelike, while Canova&rsquo;s treatment of the surface of the marble captures the soft&nbsp;texture of skin. The tactile quality of the piece is bought out particularly in the&nbsp;way the sitter&rsquo;s own hands are occupied, the fingers of her right connecting&nbsp;ever so lightly with the nape of her neck, offer a gesture charged with seductive&nbsp;promise. The head is raised slightly suggesting that something or someone has&nbsp;suddenly entered her line of vision. The apple she holds in her left hand, her&nbsp;fingers wrapped around it suggestive of erotic touch, identifies her as Venus&nbsp;Victorious, the goddess awarded the Golden Apple of Discord in perhaps the&nbsp;first beauty competition in the history of Western culture. The story comes from&nbsp;ancient Greece. Paris the Trojan prince judged Venus more beautiful than either&nbsp;of her rivals, Minerva and Juno. In return Venus introduced him to a Greek girl&nbsp;called Helen and the rest of course is the stuff of epic poetry.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Originally, Canova was to depict her as Diana, the chaste goddess of the moon&nbsp;and the hunt, a role that more would have require her to have been clothed.&nbsp;Paolina insisted on Venus, though. A bit of a loose cannon with a reputation&nbsp;for promiscuity, the Emperor&rsquo;s sister enjoyed courting controversy and posing&nbsp;naked would certainly have raised a few eyebrows in polite society. But there&nbsp;was more to it than that. Apparently, the Borghese family believed themselves&nbsp;to be descended from the heroic founder of Rome, Aeneas, who according to&nbsp;Virgil was the son of Venus. The choice then not only suited Paolina&#39;s flirtatious&nbsp;character, but also would have been met with approval by the Borghese family,&nbsp;suggesting continuity between the ancient and modern worlds.&nbsp;Her&nbsp;hair, a mass of curls bound in a Psyche knot, serves as a visual connector&nbsp;between the two, being worn in imitation of ancient Greek styles as was the&nbsp;fashion of the day. Its careful articulation offsets the smooth shallow planes of&nbsp;her torso.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Creating a contrast of another sort, the couch Paolina lies on is carved from&nbsp;a different type of marble, the base part of which is covered in rhythmically&nbsp;flowing drapery, much like on a catafalque, a raised platform used to bear coffins.&nbsp;The allusion to mortuary art is not that surprising; in Greek and Roman art the&nbsp;reclining female figure is frequently found on sarcophagus lids. So conspicuous&nbsp;an allusion demands further explanation, though, and I suppose if one were&nbsp;forced to read for a meaning here it would have to be the defeat of death by&nbsp;beauty &ndash; as expressed through art &ndash; that is being celebrated in the image.</p>\n"

Literally animated, the sculpture would have been on a&nbsp;revolving mechanism, allowing the static viewer to see the work in the round. It&nbsp;would also have been viewed by candlelight. The finely polished waxy surface&nbsp;would have reflected light brilliantly, creating chiaroscuoro, a more painterly&nbsp;than sculptural effect, perhaps, but then Canova was a painterly sculptor. Paolina&nbsp;owes more to the likes of Giorgione&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Sleeping Venus</em>&nbsp;and Titian&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Venus of Urbino</em>&nbsp;and of course David&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Madame Recamier</em>&nbsp;than antique sculpture, a point not&nbsp;lost on the Neo-classical purists of the day who condemned the work as out of&nbsp;keeping with their austere classical theories.</p>\n"

"<p>Inevitably the sculpture was going to cause a scandal. While intended for a&nbsp;private audience sophisticated enough to appreciate the classical allusions, given&nbsp;Paolina&rsquo;s infidelities, the sculpture also served to confirm the rumours about her.&nbsp;If anything, though, Paolina enjoyed the attention. Asked if she minded having to&nbsp;pose nude, she replied: &ldquo;Why should I? The studio was heated.&rdquo; Camillo refused&nbsp;to allow the sculpture to leave his residence. Napoleon agreed.</p>\n"

"<p>From Ingres to Renoir, from Proud&rsquo;hon to Puvis de Chavannes, <em>Paolina Borghese&nbsp;as Venus Victorious</em> had an enormous impact on nineteenth century French&nbsp;artists. It is in the works of the English sculptor John Gibson, though, who Canova&nbsp;took under his wing later on in life, that we find her most faithful devotee.&nbsp;Animating the figure with pools of reflected light, the glistening waxy surface&nbsp;of his most celebrated work&nbsp;<em>The Tinted Venus</em>&nbsp;owes much to&nbsp;<em>Venus Victorious</em>;&nbsp;together with his own innovative use of polychromy the sculpture provoked&nbsp;outrage among its Victorian audience for whom it appeared a little too real: &ldquo;a&nbsp;naked, impudent English woman&rdquo; as one review put her. Canova&rsquo;s own naked,&nbsp;impudent French woman would have been proud.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Biblical reference</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The site of Jericho is best known for its identity in the Bible and this has drawn pilgrims and explorers to it as early as the 4th century C.E.; serious archaeological exploration didn&rsquo;t begin until the latter half of the 19th century. What continues to draw archaeologists to Jericho today is the hope of finding some evidence of the warrior Joshua, who lead the Israelites to an unlikely victory against the Canaanites (&quot;the walls of the city fell when Joshua and his men marched around them blowing horns&quot; Joshua 6:1-27). Although unequivocal evidence of Joshua himself has yet to be found, what has been uncovered are some 12,000 years of human activity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most spectacular finds at Jericho, however, do not date to the time of Joshua, roughly the Bronze Age (3300-1200 B.C.E.), but rather to the earliest part of the Neolithic era, before even the technology to make pottery had been discovered.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"<h3>Old walls</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The site of Jericho rises above the wide plain of the Jordan Valley, its height the result of layer upon layer of human habitation, a formation called a Tell. The earliest visitors to the site who left remains (stone tools) came in the Mesolithic period (around 9000 B.C.E.) but the first settlement at the site, around the Ein as-Sultan spring, dates to the early Neolithic era, and these people, who built homes, grew plants, and kept animals, were among the earliest to do such anywhere in&nbsp;the world. Specifically, in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A levels at Jericho (8500-7000 B.C.E.) archaeologists found remains of a very large settlement of circular homes made with mud brick and topped with domed roofs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As the name of this era implies, these early people at Jericho had not yet figured out how to make pottery, but they made vessels out of stone, wove cloth and for tools were trading for a particularly useful kind of stone, obsidian, from as far away as &Ccedil;iftlik, in eastern Turkey. The settlement grew quickly and, for reasons unknown, the inhabitants soon constructed a substantial stone wall and exterior ditch around their town, complete with a stone tower almost eight meters high, set against the inner side of the wall. Theories as to the function of this wall range from military defense to keeping out animal predators to even combating the natural rising of the level of the ground surrounding the settlement. However, regardless of its original use, here we have the first version of the walls Joshua so ably conquered some six thousand years later.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Plastered human skulls</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A period is followed by the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (7000-5200 BCE), which was different from its predecessor in important ways. Houses in this era were uniformly rectangular and constructed with a new kind of rectangular mud bricks which were decorated with herringbone thumb impressions, and always laid lengthwise in thick mud mortar. This mortar, like a plaster, was also used to create a smooth surface on the interior walls, extending down across the floors as well. In this period there is some strong evidence for cult or religious belief at Jericho. Archaeologists discovered one uniquely large building dating to the period with unique series of plastered interior pits and basins as well as domed adjoining structures and it is thought this was for ceremonial use.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Plastered human skull from Jericho, Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, c. 7200 B.C.E.

Shells were used for eyes and traces of paint revealed that skin and hair were also included in the representations. The largest group found together were nine examples, buried in the fill below the plastered floor of one house.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Jericho isn&rsquo;t the only site at which plastered skulls have been found in Pre-Pottery Neolithic B levels; they have also been found at Tell Ramad, Beisamoun, Kfar Hahoresh, &lsquo;Ain Ghazal and Nahal Hemar. Among the some sixty-two skulls discovered among these sites, we know that older and younger men as well as women and children are represented, which poses interesting questions as to their meaning. Were they focal points in ancestor worship, as was originally thought, or did they function as images by which deceased family members could be remembered? As we are without any written record of the belief system practiced in the Neolithic period in the area, we will never know.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Biblical reference</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The site of Jericho is best known for its identity in the Bible and this has drawn pilgrims and explorers to it as early as the 4th century C.E.; serious archaeological exploration didn&rsquo;t begin until the latter half of the 19th century. What continues to draw archaeologists to Jericho today is the hope of finding some evidence of the warrior Joshua, who lead the Israelites to an unlikely victory against the Canaanites (&quot;the walls of the city fell when Joshua and his men marched around them blowing horns&quot; Joshua 6:1-27). Although unequivocal evidence of Joshua himself has yet to be found, what has been uncovered are some 12,000 years of human activity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most spectacular finds at Jericho, however, do not date to the time of Joshua, roughly the Bronze Age (3300-1200 B.C.E.), but rather to the earliest part of the Neolithic era, before even the technology to make pottery had been discovered.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"<h3>Old walls</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The site of Jericho rises above the wide plain of the Jordan Valley, its height the result of layer upon layer of human habitation, a formation called a Tell. The earliest visitors to the site who left remains (stone tools) came in the Mesolithic period (around 9000 B.C.E.) but the first settlement at the site, around the Ein as-Sultan spring, dates to the early Neolithic era, and these people, who built homes, grew plants, and kept animals, were among the earliest to do such anywhere in&nbsp;the world. Specifically, in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A levels at Jericho (8500-7000 B.C.E.) archaeologists found remains of a very large settlement of circular homes made with mud brick and topped with domed roofs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As the name of this era implies, these early people at Jericho had not yet figured out how to make pottery, but they made vessels out of stone, wove cloth and for tools were trading for a particularly useful kind of stone, obsidian, from as far away as &Ccedil;iftlik, in eastern Turkey. The settlement grew quickly and, for reasons unknown, the inhabitants soon constructed a substantial stone wall and exterior ditch around their town, complete with a stone tower almost eight meters high, set against the inner side of the wall. Theories as to the function of this wall range from military defense to keeping out animal predators to even combating the natural rising of the level of the ground surrounding the settlement. However, regardless of its original use, here we have the first version of the walls Joshua so ably conquered some six thousand years later.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Plastered human skulls</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A period is followed by the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (7000-5200 BCE), which was different from its predecessor in important ways. Houses in this era were uniformly rectangular and constructed with a new kind of rectangular mud bricks which were decorated with herringbone thumb impressions, and always laid lengthwise in thick mud mortar. This mortar, like a plaster, was also used to create a smooth surface on the interior walls, extending down across the floors as well. In this period there is some strong evidence for cult or religious belief at Jericho. Archaeologists discovered one uniquely large building dating to the period with unique series of plastered interior pits and basins as well as domed adjoining structures and it is thought this was for ceremonial use.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Plastered human skull from Jericho, Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, c. 7200 B.C.E.

(The British Museum)</span></span>Other possible evidence of cult practice was discovered in several homes of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic town, in the form of plastered human skulls which were molded over to resemble living heads. Shells were used for eyes and traces of paint revealed that skin and hair were also included in the representations. The largest group found together were nine examples, buried in the fill below the plastered floor of one house.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Jericho isn&rsquo;t the only site at which plastered skulls have been found in Pre-Pottery Neolithic B levels; they have also been found at Tell Ramad, Beisamoun, Kfar Hahoresh, &lsquo;Ain Ghazal and Nahal Hemar. Among the some sixty-two skulls discovered among these sites, we know that older and younger men as well as women and children are represented, which poses interesting questions as to their meaning. Were they focal points in ancestor worship, as was originally thought, or did they function as images by which deceased family members could be remembered? As we are without any written record of the belief system practiced in the Neolithic period in the area, we will never know.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The extravagant &quot;humility&quot;&nbsp;of&nbsp;rich patrons (the Medici, the Tornabuoni and others), adorning the city with thinly-veiled monuments to themselves, came to be considered a demonstration of virtuous public service, celebrated as civic <em>magnificenza</em>.&nbsp; I suppose Donald Trump may see&nbsp;himself in the much the same way, scattering his showy, shiny monuments across&nbsp;America.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Bible in Florence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ghirlandaio loved Florence and fresco, and he adored the world and all of its charms. &nbsp; In contrast to the solid, stoic and severe formal classicism of the earlier generation of Alberti, Brunelleschi and Masaccio, Ghirlandaio loved form, color, variety, narrative and the quotidian (everyday)&nbsp;details of Florentine daily life. Although the primary narratives depicted in the Tornabuoni Chapel are scenes from the Life of John the Baptist and from the Life of the Virgin, these biblical scenes unfold in the streets of Florence, often staged in what appear to be temporary stage-sets, theatrical triumphal arches and temples, strewn with various bits of ancient Roman bric-a-brac, hastily assembled for the biblical actors. When you peer through the arches of these Lego-land wonders, you see the solid, sturdy, stone medieval fa&ccedil;ades of Florence&mdash;no matter where he goes in his imagination, for Ghirlandaio, Florence is the whole world. The conflation of time past and time present in the frescoes is also underscored by the inclusion, in many scenes, of late-fifteenth century members of the Tornabuoni family in the biblical subjects, floating across the stage like ghostly apparitions. For over 500 years these vivid frescoes have played across the walls of the chapel like a continuously looping documentary film, chronicling the living history of Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The painter &nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Domenico Ghirlandaio&nbsp;is often given rather short shrift by art historians existing, as he did, suspended between the austere Albertian mathematical rationalism of the fifteenth century and the agonized, self-flagellant extravagances of Michelangelo, to whom he served as painting master before he took up residence in the Medici garden. Trained in the family workshop, Ghirlandaio was an acknowledged fresco expert, and while his style is sometimes dismissed as &quot;prosaic,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it happily idiomatic, clearly revelling in the quotidian joys of observing the world around him&mdash;which is not to say that he lacked imagination. He had a distinct penchant for embellishing severe classical architectural settings with fanciful, fluid and flirtatious decorative flourishes and then peopling them with the most extraordinarily vivid and lively figures. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Every picture tells a story: the narratives</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The overall narrative program of the chapel is relatively simple, covering the two lateral walls, and part of the rear wall (around and above the magnificent stained-glass windows) in superimposed registers, &nbsp;culminating in frescoes of the Four Evangelists on the ceiling. &nbsp;</p>\n"

The message is clear&mdash;three mothers, two sons, two dispensations.

The frescoes are, therefore, touching commemorative tributes to Giovanna, mingling the joys of birth with the sadness of death and the hope for eternal salvation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The life of the Virgin</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the many lovely aspects of the life of the Virgin, the loveliest is the story of her conception, born of a kiss between the aged Joachim and the long-barren Saint Ann, as they linger by the city gate. Ghirlandaio places this close encounter of the Biblical kind at the top of a staircase inside what appears to be a contemporary Florentine palace, where it gives way seamlessly to the contiguous <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>, easily the best-known scene from the chapel. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>St Ann props herself up in her fifteenth-century platform bed, in a luxuriously panelled room topped by a continuous frieze of illusionistically &quot;carved&quot;&nbsp;chubby, churning dancing putti. Midwives in the foreground pour water from an elegant pewter jug into a pewter basic, preparing baby&rsquo;s bath. The baby is a wriggling delight, held by a midwife and facing toward the still-floating Giovanna Tornabuoni, accompanied by her usual female entourage, all sumptuously dressed in high fifteenth-century Florentine style. Their presence is a reminder of the customary visits made by women of aristocratic families on the occasion of a birth. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>We next proceed through the <em>Presentation of the Virgin</em>, fluttering up the stairs to the high priest, her marriage to Joseph, the <em>Nativity</em> and, on a different note,&nbsp;the <em>Massacre of the Innocents</em> (image below&mdash;showing&nbsp;the execution of all young male children in the vicinity of Bethlehem ordered by King Herod to avoid the loss of his throne to a newborn King of the Jews whose birth had been announced to him by the Magi). But even here, in a scene of violent infanticide, Ghirlandaio can&rsquo;t shed his delight in fluttering, colourful sinuous draperies and an over-abundance of happy detail, which tends to highlight the ghoulishness of the dismembered baby parts strewn across the foreground, as though the putti of the Virgin&rsquo;s chamber (see the <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>&nbsp;above) had crumbled from the walls.</p>\n"

"<h3>The life of Saint&nbsp;John the Baptist</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are a number of frescoes depicting standard scenes associated with the life of the Baptist&mdash;chiefly his wanderings in the desert, during which he realizes his avocation, and his subsequent Baptism of Christ. &nbsp;But people sometimes forget that John, like Christ, was the result of a miraculous pregnancy. His parents, Zachariah and Elizabeth, had no children, but God heard&nbsp;Zachariah&rsquo;s prayers and the elderly Elizabeth found herself pregnant, three months in advance of the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary (the moment when Mary conceives Christ).&nbsp;The cycle therefore features the lovely moment of the <em>Visitation</em>, when Elizabeth and Mary encounter each other while pregnant and the unborn John &ldquo;leaps up&rdquo; in his mother&rsquo;s womb in recognition of the presence of Christ (Luke 1: 39-45). &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, The Visitation, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\n"

"\n"
"<p>In his typical fashion, Ghirlandaio sets this encounter in a hybrid city setting; the women stand just inside a medieval wall and the Virgin faces toward the gliding and omniscient presence of Giovanna Tornabuoni.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Left to right: Mary, Elizabeth, two attendants, Giovanna Tornabuoni, and two more attendants (detail), Domenico Ghirlandaio, The Visitation, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c735a35efaecf3c5d2ecb803023bc5a933fffc08.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Left to right: Mary, Elizabeth, two attendants, Giovanna Tornabuoni, and two more attendants (detail), Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>The Visitation</em>, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span>On the far right is the profile of a gleefully festooned triumphal arch. In this confrontation of architectural styles, medieval and Renaissance, the old medieval world is giving way to the newly reborn &quot;Roman&quot;&nbsp;present, a trope Ghirlandaio borrowed from contemporary Netherlandish art. St. John the&nbsp;Baptist has his own lovingly detailed birth scene, complete with a rushing female figure carrying a birth tray of fresh fruits and replenishing foods to the new mother, the ever-watchful Giovanna Tornabuoni in the foreground.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, Zaccariah Writes the Name of John, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e1335d0f0e55d444ed0eb9acd06413e961ff4b27.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Domenico Ghirlandaio, Zaccariah Writes the Name of John, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the other scenes here, the one in which <em>Zaccariah Writes the Name of John</em> is the most unusual. &nbsp;At the moment of the angel Gabriel&rsquo;s announcement of Elizabeth&rsquo;s pregnancy, Zaccariah asked for a sign as proof; &nbsp;because he had spoken doubtfully, he lost the power of speech, regaining it only after writing on a tablet, at Elizabeth&rsquo;s urging, &quot;His name is John&quot;&nbsp;(Luke 1:18-22). The emphasis in this scene on written evidence is, perhaps, an allusion to the world of documents and contracts that characterized the Tornabuoni banking world.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The altar wall</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, Annunciation, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3b16c93c664fcbd7afccfa0a3c71c370e3390be6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>Annunciation</em>, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span>On the lowest register, the altar wall features kneeling portraits of the donors, Giovanni Tornabuoni and his wife Francesca Pitti.&nbsp;In the upper registers, around and above the triple-mullioned stained-glass windows, we see the <em>Annunciation</em> and <em>St John in the Desert</em>, then scenes from the lives of two prominent Dominican saints, appropriate in a Dominican church. &nbsp;In one, Saint&nbsp;Dominic Tests Books in Fire and in the other we see the Death of Saint&nbsp;Peter Martyr. The cycle on this wall culminates in a <em>Coronation of the Virgin with Saints</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Again, for Ghirlandaio, God is clearly always in the details. The Saint&nbsp;Dominic scene depicts a moment in the saint&rsquo;s fight against the Cathars (who professed a belief in the dualistic principles of good and evil, God and Satan, in opposition to the monotheism of the Catholic faith), in which only his books survived a test of fire when thrown into the flames alongside the Cathar&rsquo;s &quot;heretical&quot;&nbsp;texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Death of Peter Martyr (left), St. Dominic Tests Books in Fire (right), fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\n"

"\n"
"<p>This is interesting because of its juxtaposition with the <em>Death of Peter Martyr</em>; a preacher from Verona whose family was sympathetic to the Cathar cause. He returned to orthodoxy when he met Saint&nbsp;Dominic. As Shakespeare says, &quot;the truth will out.&quot;&nbsp;I have no idea why late-fifteenth-century Dominicans were concerned with the Cathars, but it&rsquo;s possible that the reference to Catharism here was intended by the Tornabuoni to &quot;out&quot;&nbsp;rival merchant families in Florence, like the Pulci, whose ancestors were associated with the Cathars. Thus the personal is intertwined with the political, all interwoven into the marvelous textures of Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Like the Medici, they employed this kind of sacred patronage to expiate themselves against charges of immoral luxuriousness and wealth, as well as to quell suspicions of usury (charging interest, which was considered a sin). &nbsp;The irony, of course, is that a fresco insurance policy as grand as this one was only obtained at great cost, and was intended to attract maximum public attention. The extravagant &quot;humility&quot;&nbsp;of&nbsp;rich patrons (the Medici, the Tornabuoni and others), adorning the city with thinly-veiled monuments to themselves, came to be considered a demonstration of virtuous public service, celebrated as civic <em>magnificenza</em>.&nbsp; I suppose Donald Trump may see&nbsp;himself in the much the same way, scattering his showy, shiny monuments across&nbsp;America.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Bible in Florence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ghirlandaio loved Florence and fresco, and he adored the world and all of its charms. &nbsp; In contrast to the solid, stoic and severe formal classicism of the earlier generation of Alberti, Brunelleschi and Masaccio, Ghirlandaio loved form, color, variety, narrative and the quotidian (everyday)&nbsp;details of Florentine daily life. Although the primary narratives depicted in the Tornabuoni Chapel are scenes from the Life of John the Baptist and from the Life of the Virgin, these biblical scenes unfold in the streets of Florence, often staged in what appear to be temporary stage-sets, theatrical triumphal arches and temples, strewn with various bits of ancient Roman bric-a-brac, hastily assembled for the biblical actors. When you peer through the arches of these Lego-land wonders, you see the solid, sturdy, stone medieval fa&ccedil;ades of Florence&mdash;no matter where he goes in his imagination, for Ghirlandaio, Florence is the whole world. The conflation of time past and time present in the frescoes is also underscored by the inclusion, in many scenes, of late-fifteenth century members of the Tornabuoni family in the biblical subjects, floating across the stage like ghostly apparitions. For over 500 years these vivid frescoes have played across the walls of the chapel like a continuously looping documentary film, chronicling the living history of Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The painter &nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Domenico Ghirlandaio&nbsp;is often given rather short shrift by art historians existing, as he did, suspended between the austere Albertian mathematical rationalism of the fifteenth century and the agonized, self-flagellant extravagances of Michelangelo, to whom he served as painting master before he took up residence in the Medici garden. Trained in the family workshop, Ghirlandaio was an acknowledged fresco expert, and while his style is sometimes dismissed as &quot;prosaic,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it happily idiomatic, clearly revelling in the quotidian joys of observing the world around him&mdash;which is not to say that he lacked imagination. He had a distinct penchant for embellishing severe classical architectural settings with fanciful, fluid and flirtatious decorative flourishes and then peopling them with the most extraordinarily vivid and lively figures. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Every picture tells a story: the narratives</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The overall narrative program of the chapel is relatively simple, covering the two lateral walls, and part of the rear wall (around and above the magnificent stained-glass windows) in superimposed registers, &nbsp;culminating in frescoes of the Four Evangelists on the ceiling. &nbsp;</p>\n"

The message is clear&mdash;three mothers, two sons, two dispensations. John&rsquo;s fate, as the last Prophet of the Old Testament and first Apostle of the New Testament, is to recognize Jesus&nbsp;as the Messiah&mdash;this translation from old to new is the lynchpin that holds the cycles together.</p>\n"

The frescoes are, therefore, touching commemorative tributes to Giovanna, mingling the joys of birth with the sadness of death and the hope for eternal salvation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The life of the Virgin</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the many lovely aspects of the life of the Virgin, the loveliest is the story of her conception, born of a kiss between the aged Joachim and the long-barren Saint Ann, as they linger by the city gate. Ghirlandaio places this close encounter of the Biblical kind at the top of a staircase inside what appears to be a contemporary Florentine palace, where it gives way seamlessly to the contiguous <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>, easily the best-known scene from the chapel. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>St Ann props herself up in her fifteenth-century platform bed, in a luxuriously panelled room topped by a continuous frieze of illusionistically &quot;carved&quot;&nbsp;chubby, churning dancing putti. Midwives in the foreground pour water from an elegant pewter jug into a pewter basic, preparing baby&rsquo;s bath. The baby is a wriggling delight, held by a midwife and facing toward the still-floating Giovanna Tornabuoni, accompanied by her usual female entourage, all sumptuously dressed in high fifteenth-century Florentine style. Their presence is a reminder of the customary visits made by women of aristocratic families on the occasion of a birth. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46710ba01378e1f311428c487b8e69d541cbe707.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Left to right: Giovanna Tornabuoni, midwives with baby, St Ann (detail),&nbsp;Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>, fresco, 24 feet 4 inches x 14 feet 9 inches, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We next proceed through the <em>Presentation of the Virgin</em>, fluttering up the stairs to the high priest, her marriage to Joseph, the <em>Nativity</em> and, on a different note,&nbsp;the <em>Massacre of the Innocents</em> (image below&mdash;showing&nbsp;the execution of all young male children in the vicinity of Bethlehem ordered by King Herod to avoid the loss of his throne to a newborn King of the Jews whose birth had been announced to him by the Magi). But even here, in a scene of violent infanticide, Ghirlandaio can&rsquo;t shed his delight in fluttering, colourful sinuous draperies and an over-abundance of happy detail, which tends to highlight the ghoulishness of the dismembered baby parts strewn across the foreground, as though the putti of the Virgin&rsquo;s chamber (see the <em>Birth of the Virgin</em>&nbsp;above) had crumbled from the walls.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The life of Saint&nbsp;John the Baptist</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are a number of frescoes depicting standard scenes associated with the life of the Baptist&mdash;chiefly his wanderings in the desert, during which he realizes his avocation, and his subsequent Baptism of Christ. &nbsp;But people sometimes forget that John, like Christ, was the result of a miraculous pregnancy. His parents, Zachariah and Elizabeth, had no children, but God heard&nbsp;Zachariah&rsquo;s prayers and the elderly Elizabeth found herself pregnant, three months in advance of the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary (the moment when Mary conceives Christ).&nbsp;The cycle therefore features the lovely moment of the <em>Visitation</em>, when Elizabeth and Mary encounter each other while pregnant and the unborn John &ldquo;leaps up&rdquo; in his mother&rsquo;s womb in recognition of the presence of Christ (Luke 1: 39-45). &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In his typical fashion, Ghirlandaio sets this encounter in a hybrid city setting; the women stand just inside a medieval wall and the Virgin faces toward the gliding and omniscient presence of Giovanna Tornabuoni.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c735a35efaecf3c5d2ecb803023bc5a933fffc08.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Left to right: Mary, Elizabeth, two attendants, Giovanna Tornabuoni, and two more attendants (detail), Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>The Visitation</em>, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span>On the far right is the profile of a gleefully festooned triumphal arch. In this confrontation of architectural styles, medieval and Renaissance, the old medieval world is giving way to the newly reborn &quot;Roman&quot;&nbsp;present, a trope Ghirlandaio borrowed from contemporary Netherlandish art. St. John the&nbsp;Baptist has his own lovingly detailed birth scene, complete with a rushing female figure carrying a birth tray of fresh fruits and replenishing foods to the new mother, the ever-watchful Giovanna Tornabuoni in the foreground.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Among the other scenes here, the one in which <em>Zaccariah Writes the Name of John</em> is the most unusual. &nbsp;At the moment of the angel Gabriel&rsquo;s announcement of Elizabeth&rsquo;s pregnancy, Zaccariah asked for a sign as proof; &nbsp;because he had spoken doubtfully, he lost the power of speech, regaining it only after writing on a tablet, at Elizabeth&rsquo;s urging, &quot;His name is John&quot;&nbsp;(Luke 1:18-22). The emphasis in this scene on written evidence is, perhaps, an allusion to the world of documents and contracts that characterized the Tornabuoni banking world.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The altar wall</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Domenico Ghirlandaio, Annunciation, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3b16c93c664fcbd7afccfa0a3c71c370e3390be6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Domenico Ghirlandaio, <em>Annunciation</em>, fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span>On the lowest register, the altar wall features kneeling portraits of the donors, Giovanni Tornabuoni and his wife Francesca Pitti.&nbsp;In the upper registers, around and above the triple-mullioned stained-glass windows, we see the <em>Annunciation</em> and <em>St John in the Desert</em>, then scenes from the lives of two prominent Dominican saints, appropriate in a Dominican church. &nbsp;In one, Saint&nbsp;Dominic Tests Books in Fire and in the other we see the Death of Saint&nbsp;Peter Martyr. The cycle on this wall culminates in a <em>Coronation of the Virgin with Saints</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Again, for Ghirlandaio, God is clearly always in the details. The Saint&nbsp;Dominic scene depicts a moment in the saint&rsquo;s fight against the Cathars (who professed a belief in the dualistic principles of good and evil, God and Satan, in opposition to the monotheism of the Catholic faith), in which only his books survived a test of fire when thrown into the flames alongside the Cathar&rsquo;s &quot;heretical&quot;&nbsp;texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Death of Peter Martyr (left), St. Dominic Tests Books in Fire (right), fresco, c. 1485-90 (Cappella Maggiore,Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\n"

"\n"
"<p>This is interesting because of its juxtaposition with the <em>Death of Peter Martyr</em>; a preacher from Verona whose family was sympathetic to the Cathar cause. He returned to orthodoxy when he met Saint&nbsp;Dominic. As Shakespeare says, &quot;the truth will out.&quot;&nbsp;I have no idea why late-fifteenth-century Dominicans were concerned with the Cathars, but it&rsquo;s possible that the reference to Catharism here was intended by the Tornabuoni to &quot;out&quot;&nbsp;rival merchant families in Florence, like the Pulci, whose ancestors were associated with the Cathars. Thus the personal is intertwined with the political, all interwoven into the marvelous textures of Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Painted Statuary</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most statuary was painted; even stones selected for the symbolism of their color were often painted.

"<h3>Wood</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Egyptian artists also used a variety of woods in their work, including the native acacia, tamarisk, and sycamore fig as well as fir, cedar, and other conifers imported from Syria.

"\n"
"<p>Many objects, especially small amulets and inlays, were made from a manufactured material known as Egyptian faience. This quartz-based medium could be easily shaped, molded, and mass produced.

"<h3><span>Relief Sculpture</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Relief was usually carved before being painted. The two primary classes of relief are raised relief (where the figures stand up out from the surface) and sunk relief (where the figures are cut into and below the surface). The surface would be smoothed with a layer of plaster and then painted. If the surface was not carved before painting, several layers of mud plaster would be applied to create a flat plane.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The drawing surface would be delineated using gridded guidelines, snapped onto the wall using string coated in red pigment dust (very much like chalk lines used by modern carpenters). This grid helped the artists properly proportion the figures and lay out the scenes. Scene elements were drafted out using red paint, corrections noted in black paint, and then the painting was executed one color at a time. Even on carved relief, many elements in a scene would be executed only in paint and not cut into the surface.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>Pigments</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most pigments in Egypt were derived from local minerals. White was often made from gypsum, black from carbon, reds and yellows from iron oxides, blue and green from azurite and malachite, and bright yellow (representing gold) from orpiment. These minerals were ground and then mixed with a plant or animal based glue to make a medium able to attach to the walls. They could be applied as a single plane, but were also layered to create subtle effects and additional colors, such as pink or gray. More information on the materials used to make pigments, as well as a discussion of the symbolism of various colors may be found in the article &ldquo;Aspects of Color in Ancient Egypt&rdquo; at Egyptological.</p>\n"

Photo: Amy Calvert</span></span>Jewelry work was quite sophisticated even in the Old Kingdom, as demonstrated by some highly creative pieces depicted in tomb scenes. A cache of royal jewelry from the tombs of Middle Kingdom princesses displays extremely high levels of skill in terms of design as well as precisely cut stone inlays, repouss&eacute;, and cloisonn&eacute;.</p>\n"

"<p>Many objects, especially small amulets and inlays, were made from a manufactured material known as Egyptian faience. This quartz-based medium could be easily shaped, molded, and mass produced. The glaze coating could be almost any color, depending on the minerals used in the composition, although turquoise blue is the most common.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Relief Sculpture</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Relief was usually carved before being painted. The two primary classes of relief are raised relief (where the figures stand up out from the surface) and sunk relief (where the figures are cut into and below the surface). The surface would be smoothed with a layer of plaster and then painted. If the surface was not carved before painting, several layers of mud plaster would be applied to create a flat plane.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The drawing surface would be delineated using gridded guidelines, snapped onto the wall using string coated in red pigment dust (very much like chalk lines used by modern carpenters). This grid helped the artists properly proportion the figures and lay out the scenes. Scene elements were drafted out using red paint, corrections noted in black paint, and then the painting was executed one color at a time. Even on carved relief, many elements in a scene would be executed only in paint and not cut into the surface.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>Pigments</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most pigments in Egypt were derived from local minerals. White was often made from gypsum, black from carbon, reds and yellows from iron oxides, blue and green from azurite and malachite, and bright yellow (representing gold) from orpiment. These minerals were ground and then mixed with a plant or animal based glue to make a medium able to attach to the walls. They could be applied as a single plane, but were also layered to create subtle effects and additional colors, such as pink or gray. More information on the materials used to make pigments, as well as a discussion of the symbolism of various colors may be found in the article &ldquo;Aspects of Color in Ancient Egypt&rdquo; at Egyptological.</p>\n"

Louis ruled by divine right, receiving his authority directly from God. The concept of divine right allowed Louis to quash emerging rebellions while establishing legitimacy.

It is no coincidence that Louis is posed with his majestic robe draped over his shoulder to reveal his lower limbs: Louis had been a ballet dancer in his youth and prided himself on his dancer&rsquo;s legs. The legs, while in contrast to his aged face, suggest a vital and vigorous man, still in the prime of his power.

"\n"
"<p>The &quot;Caves of the Thousand Buddhas,&quot;&nbsp;or <em>Qianfodong</em>, are situated at Mogao, about 25 kilometres south-east of the oasis town of Dunhuang in Gansu province, western China, in the middle of the desert. By the late fourth century, the area had become a busy desert crossroads on the caravan routes of the Silk Road linking China and the West. Traders, pilgrims and other travelers stopped at the oasis town to stock up with provisions, pray for the journey ahead or give thanks for their survival.&nbsp;At about this time wandering monks carved the first caves into the long cliff stretching almost 2 kilometers in length along the Daquan River.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Over the next millennium more than 1000 caves of varying sizes were dug. Around five hundred of these were decorated as cave temples, carved from the gravel conglomerate of the escarpment.

Euthymides had a clear sense of achievement and was indeed proud of his work, boastfully challenging his friend and rival&mdash;Euphronios. He would see Euphronios often, as well as other painters in the Kerameikos&mdash;the potter&rsquo;s quarter in Athens. They would be curious to see one another&rsquo;s new work, sometimes with appreciation, sometimes with a bit of jealousy. In the evenings they often had a good time together at a symposium&nbsp;(a kind of ancient Greek male drinking party). They would drink wine mixed with water, become garrulous, loud and&mdash;if drinking went on for too long&mdash;they might even start singing and even dancing. Perhaps what is depicted on this amphora is a scene similar to those Euthymides witnessed at one of these long parties.&nbsp;Euphronios indeed was a master potter and painter, and Euthymides knew that and had a full appreciation for his work. He thought however, that his figures seemed much more lively, caught in a split of a moment, in a dancing movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beginnings of red-figure painting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Euthymides worked mainly between 515 and 500 B.C.E., in a time when artists were exploring the possibilities of red-figure technique, invented in Athens around 530 B.C.E. Both Euthymides and Euphronios belonged to a kind of camaraderie of artists, often dubbed the &ldquo;Pioneer Group&quot; by art historians&mdash;referring to their innovative efforts in the new technique. In the red-figure technique, an artist sketches figures on the&nbsp;red clay of a freshly fashioned vessel, then covers all the background with a slip (a liquid clay), which&nbsp;turns black after final firing. Details, like elements of anatomy, folds of drapery, etc. &nbsp;can be freely added with a thin brush; the slip can be darker, sometimes more diluted, brownish, adding even more variety. In the&nbsp;black-figure technique which was used previously, an artist had to fill the figures with slip, and then incise the details with a sharp burin, which was much more difficult to handle. At the time of the&nbsp;&ldquo;Pioneers,&rdquo;&nbsp; there is a general trend in Greek art to observe the reality and represent human body more realistically, leaving the more stiff archaic models behind.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Euthymides had a clear sense of achievement and was indeed proud of his work, boastfully challenging his friend and rival&mdash;Euphronios. He would see Euphronios often, as well as other painters in the Kerameikos&mdash;the potter&rsquo;s quarter in Athens. They would be curious to see one another&rsquo;s new work, sometimes with appreciation, sometimes with a bit of jealousy. In the evenings they often had a good time together at a symposium&nbsp;(a kind of ancient Greek male drinking party). They would drink wine mixed with water, become garrulous, loud and&mdash;if drinking went on for too long&mdash;they might even start singing and even dancing. Perhaps what is depicts on this amphora&nbsp;is a scene similar to those Euthymides&nbsp;witnessed at one of these long parties? Euphronios indeed was a master potter and painter, and Euthymides knew that and had a full appreciation for his work. He thought however, that his figures seemed much more lively, caught in a split of a moment, in a dancing movement.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beginnings of red-figure painting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Euthymides worked mainly between 515 and 500 B.C.E., in a time when artists were exploring the possibilities of red-figure technique, invented in Athens around 530 B.C.E. Both Euthymides and Euphronios belonged to a kind of camaraderie of artists, often dubbed the &ldquo;Pioneer Group&quot; by art historians&mdash;referring to their innovative efforts in the new technique. In the red-figure technique, an artist sketches figures on the&nbsp;red clay of a freshly fashioned vessel, then covers all the background with a slip (a liquid clay), which&nbsp;turns black after final firing. Details, like elements of anatomy, folds of drapery, etc. &nbsp;can be freely added with a thin brush; the slip can be darker, sometimes more diluted, brownish, adding even more variety. In the&nbsp;black-figure technique which was used previously, an artist had to fill the figures with slip, and then incise the details with a sharp burin, which was much more difficult to handle. At the time of the&nbsp;&ldquo;Pioneers,&rdquo;&nbsp; there is a general trend in Greek art to observe the reality and represent human body more realistically, leaving the more stiff archaic models behind.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Dada, or the nonsense of the everyday</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before arriving in Paris, May Ray was associated with the New York Dada group, which included the artist Marcel Duchamp. As a loosely-affiliated group of like-minded artists, they were particularly interested in using humor and antagonism to question the definition of a work of art. Re-defining art was prevalent in Duchamp&#39;s Readymades, such as his <em>Bicycle Wheel</em>, a sculpture made by conjoining a bicycle wheel and a stool, two utilitarian objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Surrealist object&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Marcel Duchamp, Bicycle Wheel, 1951 (third version, after lost original of 1913), metal wheel mounted on painted wood stool, 129.5 x 63.5 x 41.9 cm (The Museum of Modern Art), © 2014 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / ADAGP, Paris / Estate of Marcel Duchamp\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/373c056eec2607b9f674c37180553dafb4b40744.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Marcel Duchamp, <em>Bicycle Wheel</em>, 1951 (third version, after lost original of 1913), metal wheel mounted on painted wood stool, 129.5 x 63.5 x 41.9 cm (The Museum of Modern Art)</span></span>Although made in the spirit of Dada, Man Ray&#39;s <em>The Gift</em> prefigured by several years a key artistic practice that would develop within the Surrealist movement: the &ldquo;Surrealist object,&rdquo; a type of three-dimensional art work that included found objects, modified objects, and sculpted objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Surrealist object&mdash;one of many literary and visual practices in the movement&mdash;became prominent beginning in 1936, after its association with a series of extravagant international expositions organized in London and Paris. Surrealism had been first publicly announced in 1924, with the publication of Andr&eacute; Breton&#39;s first &quot;Manifesto of Surrealism.&quot; Stridently activist, Surrealists sought to release society from cultural constraints and the need to conform to social norms, which they felt curtailed people&#39;s desires to live as they wished.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Function/Dysfunction</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of the many types of Surrealist objects that were produced, two important features are present in Man Ray&#39;s <em>The Gift</em>. First, an everyday object has been changed so that its original function is denied. Indeed, the artist&#39;s relatively simple addition of tacks transforms a useful device into a destructive one.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Second, Man Ray&#39;s alteration gives a common object a symbolic function. The flatiron, associated with social expectations of propriety and middle-class values, becomes a subversive attack on social expectations. Even if Man Ray&#39;s tack-lined iron is no longer used for pressing clothes, the object resonates with ruinous, violent possibilities.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Denial and destruction</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While denial and destruction are qualities are not intrinsic to all Surrealist art, there are striking examples, like <em>The Gift</em>, that show Surrealists working with banal objects to question the viewer&#39;s expectations, and force us to re-evaluate the function of those objects in our lives.</p>\n"

It also makes the umbrella rather useless for anyone seeking shelter from rain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Another object by Man Ray&mdash;a metronome with a photograph of a woman&#39;s open eye clipped to it&mdash;adds an ominous sense of relentless observation to an ordinary musician&#39;s timing instrument. Man Ray&#39;s title of the piece, <em>Object to Be Destroyed</em>, seems mysterious at first.

"<p>Whether stolen or smashed, <em>Object to Be Destroyed</em> no longer existed. This compelled Man Ray to remake the sculpture, but he pointedly changed the title to <em>Indestructible Object</em>.</p>\n"

"<h3>Vajrayana Buddhism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Vajrayana Buddhism, which is the form of Buddhism practiced in Tibet, provides a great variety of special practices, meditations and rituals to accomplish the goals of cultivating compassion and the ultimate liberation of all living beings. Vajrayana is based on the esoteric doctrines of Buddha Shakyamuni given to selected disciples. It uses yogic techniques of meditation, mantra, and ritual to bring about psychological and physiological transformations. Initiations and empowerments are needed to understand and engage in these techniques, and to use the sacred implements such as the vajra and ghanta (bell), sacred images (such as those in the museum collection), hand and body gestures (mudra), and sacred power words (mantra).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tibetan Buddhism comprises four lineages. All trace themselves back to Buddha Shakyamuni in an unbroken lineage of enlightened masters and disciples that extends down to the present day. They are dis- tinguished much more by lineage than by any major difference in doctrine or practice. The four lineages are Gelukpa, Sakyapa, Nyingmapa and Kagyupa.</p>\n"

"<h3>Sex, Booze and 18th-Century Britain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you ever needed proof that the sex, booze and a rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll lifestyle was not a twentieth century invention, you need look no further than the satirical prints of William Hogarth. He held up a moralising mirror to eighteenth-century Britain; the harlots, the womanisers&mdash;even the clergy could not escape. Hogarth&rsquo;s prints play out the sins of eighteenth-century London in a kind of visual theatre that was entirely new and novel in their day.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4eefc3da580ebbc11899b6a2775d4c819854f9c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Harlot&#39;s Progress, plate 1</em>, 1732, etching with engraving on paper,&nbsp;31.4 x 38 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first example of these prints, which Hogarth himself termed &lsquo;modern moral subjects&rsquo;, was <em>A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress</em>. In this series, we meet the fresh faced Moll Hackabout as she arrives for the first time in London. Moll is soon preyed upon by a brothel keeper and she descends into prostitution. The tale ends with her premature death from a sexually transmitted disease, aged just twenty-three. Despite its dark subject matter <em>A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress</em> was a huge success. These prints reference characters types who were well known to their contemporary London audience. For example Moll&rsquo;s madam was the real-life Elizabeth Needham, keeper of an exclusive London brothel and her first patron, the renowned love-rat and convicted rapist, Colonel Francis Charteris.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress&nbsp;</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These sly nods to the bad guys of the day not only made the prints hugely relevant and enjoyable to their target audience but it also made them incredibly popular. <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> (1735) was Hogarth&rsquo;s second series and proved to be just as well loved. The main character is Tom Rakewell&mdash;a rake being a old fashioned term for a man of loose morals or a womaniser. Tom&rsquo;s name is intentionally general and in a modern equivalent, he might be called &lsquo;Mr. Immoral.&rsquo; Tom is not unique, he could be any number of people in eighteenth-century Britain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The series opens with a chaotic scene: Tom&rsquo;s father, who was a rich merchant, has died and Tom has returned from Oxford University to collect and spend his late father&rsquo;s wealth. He also wastes no time in rejecting his pregnant fiance, Sarah Young, by attempting to pay her off. Hogarth laces all his prints with clues to help us decode the scene. Here we can see Sarah sobbing into a hankie whilst holding her engagement ring in her hand. Her mother stands behind her angrily clutching the love letters Tom once wrote to her daughter and he holds out a handful of coins in an attempt to get rid of them. Sarah pops up throughout these prints representing a more wholesome life that he could have had.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/926ec21957ded9b4cc6541dbe73bd770018ce6c9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 2, &quot;Surrounded by Artists and Professors,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper, 35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>A Fashionable Life</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the next scene (<em>&quot;Surrounded by Artists and Professors,&quot; </em>above) Tom has already moved from his cosy, if slightly shabby family home into his new bachelor pad surrounded by a dance master, a music teacher, a poet, a tailor, a landscape gardener, a body guard and a jockey all offering their services to help Tom complete his fashionable lifestyle. He is dressed in his nightclothes indicating that he has just woken: those who wish to exploit his new found wealth are wasting no time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom&rsquo;s fashionable life also comes with fashionable vices and soon we see him in the Rose Tavern with a group of prostitutes (see <em>&quot;The Tavern Scene,&quot;</em> below). He sits on the lap of one who caresses him with one hand whilst robbing him of his watch with the other. Portraits of Roman Emperors hang on the wall behind them but the only one that has not been defaced is Nero&rsquo;s. This is perhaps hard for a modern audience to identify but there would have been a significant number of Hogarth&rsquo;s classically educated audience who got the gag: Nero was a corrupt womaniser who fiercely persecuted Christians. To the very classically aware Georgians (George II was then King) the message was clear, Christian morals are not to be found here.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8120f8ffd43a44e44f532775d38b87c90c2c184b.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 3, &quot;The Tavern Scene,&quot;</em>&nbsp;1735, engraving on paper,&nbsp;35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Decadant Decline&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom&rsquo;s decadent lifestyle does not last for long and by the third scene his sedan chair is intercepted by bailiffs as he is en route to the Queen&rsquo;s birthday party. It is at this point that our heroine Sarah Young comes to the rescue. She is now working as a milliner and kindly pays Tom&rsquo;s bail. Although Sarah has saved Tom from the bailiffs, she cannot save him from himself. By the next scene he is marrying a wealthy old hag. The old woman&rsquo;s eyes lust eagerly towards the ring and Tom&rsquo;s towards her maid. In the background Sarah Young and her mother struggle to voice their objections but are held back by some of the guests.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom is wealthy again but he is no better with his money now than he was last time and soon he is on his knees in a gambling den having just squandered the lot (see <em>&quot;The Gaming House,&quot;</em> below). Excessive gambling was a real problem in the eighteenth century and whole family fortunes could be lost in one evening. Later in the century, George III&rsquo;s son, who later became George IV, had to ask Parliament for money to help him pay off his gambling debts. It was given to him but it was not long before he needed even more.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9fe82bc65faa12dca1390cbcb089947aad332913.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 6, &quot;The Gaming House,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper,&nbsp;35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Debtors&#39; Prison</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like so many others in eighteenth-century Britain, Tom finds himself in debtors&rsquo;&nbsp;prison, quickly coming to the end of his tether. On the one side his wife derides him for squandering their fortune, on the other the beer-boy and the jailer harass him to settle his weekly bill. Sarah Young, who has come to visit Tom with their child, has fainted on seeing him in this hopeless situation. This must have been very personally relevant for Hogarth as his father spent much of his childhood in a debtors&#39; prison.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>My favourite part of the series is played out in the background of this scene. Tom&rsquo;s fellow inmates are trying various schemes to get enough money to buy their freedom. However, their choice of projects cleverly illustrate just how&nbsp;impossible it was to get out of debt in Georgian Britain. One man is attempting to turn lead into gold while the other is working on solving the national debt crisis. Even Tom has written a play, though&nbsp;we can clearly see a rejection letter for it lying on the table.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/25bdb5f05075c3fef3386848453a638ebaa3ab0f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 8, &quot;The Madhouse,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper,&nbsp;35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Bedlam</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The stresses of the previous scene have proven to be more than Tom can bear and in the final scene he is found languishing in bedlam&mdash;London&rsquo;s notorious mental hospital (see <em>&quot;The Madhouse,&quot;</em> above). The mark on his chest suggests that he has stabbed himself in a failed suicide attempt. Fashionable young women, the likes of which Tom would have socialised with just a short while ago, observe the scene in amusement. All that he has left is the company and care of the faithful Sarah Young.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why so popular?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One answer is that it appealed to the contemporary concern about people from the middle classes who tried to live like aristocrats. This was a popular issue at this time as the merchant trade was creating social mobility on a scale never seen before. However if we scratch the surface of <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> we can see that a number of different types of people implicated. For example, Tom was on his way to the Queen&rsquo;s birthday party when he was stopped by bailiffs and therefore his lifestyle is actually being encouraged and supported by aristocrats. In <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em>, everyone from the Queen to the priest that performs his marriage of convenience, to common prostitutes, &nbsp;are part of the problem.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But it is not just Hogarth&rsquo;s &lsquo;take no prisoners&rsquo; approach to social commentary that made him so popular. Printed satire was actually already very common place and central London was full of bookshops and print sellers that displayed this kind of work. What Hogarth did do that was so completely novel was to tell a story through pictures, <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> is like a story board for a play. In fact, Hogarth&rsquo;s series were adapted into plays and pantomimes during his lifetime. His visual drama offered his audience a new way to enjoy satire. It is for this reason that to find comparisons and inspirations we should be looking at authors such as Hogarth&rsquo;s friend and fellow moraliser, Henry Fielding or Jonathan Swift&mdash;author of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, rather than contemporary artists. The title <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress </em>was referencing John Bunyan&rsquo;s <em>The Pilgrims Progress</em>. We can be quite sure that most people would have gotten this reference as it is thought that, at this time, this was the most read book in Britain after the Bible. Hogarth successfully borrows from popular culture in order to express complicated ideas through an enjoyable and totally accessible story. Of course Hogarth wasn&rsquo;t the first to do this, but he did it so well, he is celebrated to this day.</p>\n"

"<h3>Sex, Booze and 18th-Century Britain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you ever needed proof that the sex, booze and a rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll lifestyle was not a twentieth century invention, you need look no further than the satirical prints of William Hogarth. He held up a moralising mirror to eighteenth-century Britain; the harlots, the womanisers&mdash;even the clergy could not escape. Hogarth&rsquo;s prints play out the sins of eighteenth-century London in a kind of visual theatre that was entirely new and novel in their day.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4eefc3da580ebbc11899b6a2775d4c819854f9c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Harlot&#39;s Progress, plate 1</em>, 1732, etching with engraving on paper,&nbsp;31.4 x 38 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first example of these prints, which Hogarth himself termed &lsquo;modern moral subjects&rsquo;, was <em>A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress</em>. In this series, we meet the fresh faced Moll Hackabout as she arrives for the first time in London. Moll is soon preyed upon by a brothel keeper and she descends into prostitution. The tale ends with her premature death from a sexually transmitted disease, aged just twenty-three. Despite its dark subject matter A Harlot&rsquo;s Progress was a huge success. These prints reference characters types who were well known to their contemporary London audience. For example Moll&rsquo;s madam was the real-life Elizabeth Needham, keeper of an exclusive London brothel and her first patron, the renowned love-rat and convicted rapist, Colonel Francis Charteris.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress&nbsp;</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These sly nods to the bad guys of the day not only made the prints hugely relevant and enjoyable to their target audience but it also made them incredibly popular. <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> (1735) was Hogarth&rsquo;s second series and proved to be just as well loved. The main character is Tom Rakewell&mdash;a rake being a old fashioned term for a man of loose morals or a womaniser. Tom&rsquo;s name is intentionally general and in a modern equivalent, he might be called &lsquo;Mr. Immoral.&rsquo; Tom is not unique, he could be any number of people in eighteenth-century Britain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The series opens with a chaotic scene: Tom&rsquo;s father, who was a rich merchant, has died and Tom has returned from Oxford University to collect and spend his late father&rsquo;s wealth. He also wastes no time in rejecting his pregnant fiance, Sarah Young, by attempting to pay her off. Hogarth laces all his prints with clues to help us decode the scene. Here we can see Sarah sobbing into a hankie whilst holding her engagement ring in her hand. Her mother stands behind her angrily clutching the love letters Tom once wrote to her daughter and he holds out a handful of coins in an attempt to get rid of them. Sarah pops up throughout these prints representing a more wholesome life that he could have had.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/926ec21957ded9b4cc6541dbe73bd770018ce6c9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 2, &quot;Surrounded by Artists and Professors,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper, 35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>A Fashionable Life</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the next scene (<em>&quot;Surrounded by Artists and Professors,&quot; </em>above) Tom has already moved from his cosy, if slightly shabby family home into his new bachelor pad surrounded by a dance master, a music teacher, a poet, a tailor, a landscape gardener, a body guard and a jockey all offering their services to help Tom complete his fashionable lifestyle. He is dressed in his nightclothes indicating that he has just woken: those who wish to exploit his new found wealth are wasting no time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom&rsquo;s fashionable life also comes with fashionable vices and soon we see him in the Rose Tavern with a group of prostitutes (see <em>&quot;The Tavern Scene,&quot;</em> below). He sits on the lap of one who caresses him with one hand whilst robbing him of his watch with the other. Portraits of Roman Emperors hang on the wall behind them but the only one that has not been defaced is Nero&rsquo;s. This is perhaps hard for a modern audience to identify but there would have been a significant number of Hogarth&rsquo;s classically educated audience who got the gag: Nero was a corrupt womaniser who fiercely persecuted Christians. To the very classically aware Georgians (George II was then King) the message was clear, Christian morals are not to be found here.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8120f8ffd43a44e44f532775d38b87c90c2c184b.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 3, &quot;The Tavern Scene,&quot;</em>&nbsp;1735, engraving on paper,&nbsp;35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Decadant Decline&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom&rsquo;s decadent lifestyle does not last for long and by the third scene his sedan chair is intercepted by bailiffs as he is en route to the Queen&rsquo;s birthday party. It is at this point that our heroine Sarah Young comes to the rescue. She is now working as a milliner and kindly pays Tom&rsquo;s bail. Although Sarah has saved Tom from the bailiffs, she cannot save him from himself. By the next scene he is marrying a wealthy old hag. The old woman&rsquo;s eyes lust eagerly towards the ring and Tom&rsquo;s towards her maid. In the background Sarah Young and her mother struggle to voice their objections but are held back by some of the guests.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tom is wealthy again but he is no better with his money now than he was last time and soon he is on his knees in a gambling den having just squandered the lot (see <em>&quot;The Gaming House,&quot;</em> below). Excessive gambling was a real problem in the eighteenth century and whole family fortunes could be lost in one evening. Later in the century, George III&rsquo;s son, who later became George IV, had to ask Parliament for money to help him pay off his gambling debts. It was given to him but it was not long before he needed even more.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9fe82bc65faa12dca1390cbcb089947aad332913.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 6, &quot;The Gaming House,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper,&nbsp;35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Debtor&rsquo;s Prison</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like so many others in eighteenth-century Britain, Tom finds himself in debtor&rsquo;s prison, quickly coming to the end of his tether. On the one side his wife derides him for squandering their fortune, on the other the beer-boy and the jailer harass him to settle his weekly bill. Sarah Young, who has come to visit Tom with their child, has fainted on seeing him in this hopeless situation. This must have been very personally relevant for Hogarth as his father spent much of his childhood in a debtor&rsquo;s prison.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>My favourite part of the series is played out in the background of this scene. Tom&rsquo;s fellow inmates are trying various schemes to get enough money to buy their freedom. However, their choice of projects cleverly illustrate just how just how impossible it was to get out of debt in Georgian Britain. One man is attempting to turn lead into gold while the other is working on solving the national debt crisis. Even Tom has written a play, thought we can clearly see a rejection letter for it lying on the table.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/25bdb5f05075c3fef3386848453a638ebaa3ab0f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">William Hogarth, <em>A Rake&#39;s Progress, plate 8, &quot;The Madhouse,&quot;</em> 1735, engraving on paper,&nbsp;35.5 x 31 cm</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Bedlam</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The stresses of the previous scene have proven to be more than Tom can bear and in the final scene he is found languishing in bedlam&mdash;London&rsquo;s notorious mental hospital (see <em>&quot;The Madhouse,&quot;</em> above). The mark on his chest suggests that he has stabbed himself in a failed suicide attempt. Fashionable young women, the likes of which Tom would have socialised with just a short while ago, observe the scene in amusement. All that he has left is the company and care of the faithful Sarah Young.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why so popular?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One answer is that it appealed to the contemporary concern about people from the middle classes who tried to live like aristocrats. This was a popular issue at this time as the merchant trade was creating social mobility on a scale never seen before. However if we scratch the surface of <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> we can see that a number of different types of people implicated. For example, Tom was on his way to the Queen&rsquo;s birthday party when he was stopped by bailiffs and therefore his lifestyle is actually being encouraged and supported by aristocrats. In <em>A Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em>, everyone from the Queen to the priest that performs his marriage of convenience, to common prostitutes, &nbsp;are part of the problem.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But it is not just Hogarth&rsquo;s &lsquo;take no prisoners&rsquo; approach to social commentary that made him so popular. Printed satire was actually already very common place and central London was full of bookshops and print sellers that displayed this kind of work. What Hogarth did do that was so completely novel was to tell a story through pictures, <em>A&nbsp;Rake&rsquo;s Progress</em> is like a story board for a play.

We can be quite sure that most people would have gotten this reference as it is thought that, at this time, this was the most read book in Britain after the Bible. Hogarth successfully borrows from popular culture in order to express complicated ideas through an enjoyable and totally accessible story. Of course Hogarth wasn&rsquo;t the first to do this, but he did it so well, he is celebrated to this day.</p>\n"

"<h3>The royal graves of Ur</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Close to temple buildings at the center of the city of Ur, sat&nbsp;a rubbish dump built up over centuries. Unable to use the area for building, the people of Ur started to bury their dead there. The cemetery was used between about 2600-2000 B.C.E. and hundreds of burials were made in pits. Many of these contained very rich materials.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In one area of the cemetery a group of sixteen graves was dated to the mid-third millennium. These large, shaft graves were distinct from the surrounding burials and consisted of a tomb, made of stone, rubble and bricks, built at the bottom of a pit. The layout of the tombs varied, some occupied the entire floor of the pit and had multiple chambers. The most complete tomb discovered belonged to a lady identified as Pu-abi from the name carved on a cylinder seal found with the burial.<br />\n"

In the Eagle mask shown above from&nbsp;the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, you can see the wooden frame and netting that held the mask on the dancer&rsquo;s head. When the cords are pulled, the eagle&rsquo;s face and beak split down the center, and the bottom of the beak opens&nbsp;downwards, giving the impression of a bird spreading its wings (see image below).

"<p>Transformation masks, like those belonging to the Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw (pronounced Kwak-wak-ah-wak, a Pacific Northwest Coast indigenous people) and illustrated here, are&nbsp;worn during a potlatch,&nbsp;a ceremony where the host displayed his status, in part by giving away gifts to those in attendance. These masks&nbsp;were only one part of a costume that also included a cloak made of red cedar bark. During a potlatch, Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw dancers perform wearing the mask&nbsp;and costume. The masks conveyed&nbsp;social position (only those with a certain status could wear them)&nbsp;and also helped to portray a family&rsquo;s genealogy by displaying&nbsp;(family) crest&nbsp;symbols.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masks are not the same across the First Nations of the Northwest Coastal areas; here we focus solely on Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw transformation masks.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw (&ldquo;Kwak&rsquo;wala speaking tribes&rdquo;) are generally called Kwakiutl by non-Native peoples. They are one of many indigenous groups that live on the western coast of British Columbia, Canada. The mythology and cosmology of different Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw Nations (such as the Kwagu&rsquo;ł (Kwakiutl) or &lsquo;Namgis) is extremely diverse, although&nbsp;there are commonalities. For instance, many groups relate that deceased ancestors roamed the world, transforming themselves in the process (this might entail removing their animal skins or masks to reveal their human selves within).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw bands are arranged into four clans (Killer Whale, Eagle, Raven, and Wolf clans). The clans are divided into <em>numayn</em> (or <em>&lsquo;na&rsquo;mina</em>), which can be loosely translated as &ldquo;group of fellows of the same kind&rdquo; (essentially groups that shared a common ancestor). <em>Numayns</em> were responsible for safe-guarding crest&nbsp;symbols and for conveying their specific rights&mdash;which might include access to natural resources (like salmon fishing areas) and rights to sacred names and dances that related to a <em>numayn&rsquo;s</em> ancestor or the group&rsquo;s origins. The <em>numayn</em> were ranked, and typically only one person could fill a spot at any given moment in time. Each rank entailed specific rights, including ceremonial privileges&mdash;like the right to wear a mask such as the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s Thunderbird transformation mask. Animal transformation masks contained crests for a given <em>numayn</em>. Ancestral entities and supernatural forces temporarily embody dancers wearing these masks and other ceremonial regalia.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Many myths relate moments of transformation often involving trickster supernaturals (a trickster is a god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphic animal who exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behavior). Raven, for instance, is known as a consummate trickster&mdash;he often changes into other creatures, and helps&nbsp;humans by providing them with a variety of useful&nbsp;things such as&nbsp;the sun, moon, fire, and salmon.&nbsp;Thunderbird (<em>Kwankwanxwalige&rsquo;</em>), who was a mythical ancestor of the Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw, also figures prominently in mythology. He is believed to cause thunder when he beats his wings, and&nbsp;lightning comes from his eyes. He lives in the celestial realm, and he can remove his bird skin to assume human form.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The masks illustrated here display a variety of brightly colored surfaces filled with complex forms. These&nbsp;masks use elements of the formline style, a term coined&nbsp;in 1965 to describe the characteristics of Northwest Coast visual culture. The Brooklyn Museum mask provides a clear example of what constitutes the formline style. For instance, The Brooklyn Museum mask (when open) displays a color palette of mostly red, blue-green, and black, which is consistent with other formline objects like a Tlingit Raven Screen (a house partition screen) attributed to Kadyisdu.axch&rsquo; (detail below). The masks, whether opened or closed, are bilaterally symmetrical. Typical of the formline style is the use of an undulating, calligraphic line. Also, note how the pupils of the eyes on the exterior of the Brooklyn Museum mask&nbsp;are ovoid shapes, similar to the figures and forms found on the interior surfaces of many masks. This ovoid shape, along with s- and u-forms, are common&nbsp;features of the formline style. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The American Museum of Natural History and Brooklyn Museum masks are carved of red cedar wood, an important and common material used for many Northwest Coast objects and buildings. Masks take months, sometimes years, to create. Because they are made of wood and other organic materials that quickly decay, most masks date to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (even though we know that the practice extends much farther into the past). In fact, the artistic style of many transformation masks it thought to have emerged over a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>With the introduction and enforcement of Christianity and as a result of colonization in the nineteenth century, masking practices changed among peoples of the Northwest Coast. Prior to contact with Russians, Europeans, and Euro-Americans, masks like the Brooklyn Museums&rsquo;s Thunderbird Transformation Mask, were not carved using metal tools. After iron tools were introduced along with other materials and equipment, masks demonstrate different carving techniques. Earlier masks used natural (plant and mineral based) pigments, post-contact,&nbsp;brighter and more durable synthetic colors were introduced. The open mask from the American Museum of Natural History, for example, displays bright red, yellow, and blue.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ceremonies and potlatches&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masks passed between family members of a specific clan (they could be inherited or gifted). They were just&nbsp;one sign of a person&rsquo;s status and rank, which were important to demonstrate within Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw society&mdash;especially during a potlatch. Franz Boas, an anthropologist who worked in this area between 1885 and 1930, noted that &ldquo;The acquisition of a high position and the maintenance of its dignity require correct marriages and wealth&mdash;wealth accumulated by industry and by loaning out property at interest&mdash;dissipated at the proper time, albeit with the understanding that each recipient of a gift has to return it with interest at a time when he is dissipating his wealth. This is the general principle underlying the potlatch&hellip;.&rdquo;[1]&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Potlatches were banned in 1885 until the 1950s because they were considered immoral&nbsp;by Christian missionaries who believed cannibalism occurred&nbsp;(for its part, the Canadian Government thought potlatches&nbsp;hindered&nbsp;economic development&nbsp;because people ceased&nbsp;work during these ritual celebrations). With the prohibition of potlatches, many masks were confiscated. Those that weren&rsquo;t destroyed often made their way into museums or private collections. When the ban against potlatches was removed by the Canadian government, many First Nations have attempted to regain possession of the masks and other objects that had been taken from them. Potlatches are still practiced today among Northwest Coast peoples.</span></p>\n"

"<p>Imagine a man&nbsp;standing before a large fire wearing&nbsp;the&nbsp;heavy eagle mask shown above&nbsp;and a long cedar bark costume on his body. He&nbsp;begins to dance, the firelight flickers&nbsp;and the feathers rustle&nbsp;as he&nbsp;moves about the room in front of hundreds of people. Now, imagine him pulling&nbsp;the string that opens the mask, he is transformed&nbsp;into something else entirely&mdash;what a powerful and dramatic moment!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Northwest Coast transformation masks&nbsp;manifest transformation, usually an animal changing into a mythical being or one animal becoming another. Masks are&nbsp;worn by dancers during&nbsp;ceremonies, they pull&nbsp;strings to open and move the mask&mdash;in effect, animating it. In the Eagle mask shown above from&nbsp;the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, you can see the wooden frame and netting that held the mask on the dancer&rsquo;s head. When the cords are pulled, the eagle&rsquo;s face and beak split down the center, and the bottom of the beak opens&nbsp;downwards, giving the impression of a bird spreading its wings (see image below). Transformed, the mask reveals the face of an ancestor.&nbsp;</p>\n"

When the ban against potlatches was removed by the Canadian government, many First Nations have attempted to regain possession of the masks and other objects that had been taken from them. Potlatches are still practiced today among Northwest Coast peoples.</span></p>\n"

"<h3><span>After <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em></span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the end of 1821 the leading Romantic painter in France, Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, returned from a year long stay in England where crowds had flocked to see his masterpiece <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em> displayed in the Egyptian Hall in Pall Mall, London. Despite the success of the exhibition, the French government still refused to buy the painting and his own prodigious spending meant that he was strapped for cash and in no position to embark on another ambitious and expensive large scale project like The Raft. His health too was soon to suffer. On his return to France, a riding accident led to complications, causing a tumor to develop on the spine that proved fatal. He died, aged 32, in January 1824.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f20d063f697a43fb0b0d729114775d848e3583f3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>A Woman Addicted to Gambling</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 77 x 64 cm (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of his last years were his portraits of the insane. There were ten of them originally. Only five have survived: <em>A Woman Addicted to Gambling</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Child Snatcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Kleptomaniac</em>; and&nbsp;<em>A Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Command</em>. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>No information is available for those that have been lost. According to the artist&rsquo;s first biographer, Charles Cl&eacute;ment, G&eacute;ricault painted them after returning from England for &Eacute;tienne-Jean Georget (1795-1828), the chief physician of the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, the women&rsquo;s asylum in Paris. The paintings were certainly in Georget&rsquo;s possession when he died.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Three Theories for the Commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How the two men met is not known for sure. Possibly Georget treated G&eacute;ricault as a patient, or perhaps they met in the Beaujon Hospital, from whose morgue G&eacute;ricault had taken home dissected limbs to serve as studies for his figures in The Raft. What is more debated though, is Georget&rsquo;s role in the production of the paintings. There are three main theories. The first two link the portraits to the psychological toll taken out of G&eacute;ricault whilst producing his great masterpiece and the nervous breakdown he is believed to have suffered in the autumn following its completion in 1819. The first theory runs that Georget helped him to recover from this episode and that the portraits were produced for and given to the doctor as a gesture of thanks; the second puts forward that Georget, as the artist&rsquo;s physician, encouraged G&eacute;ricault to paint them as an early form of art therapy; and the third is that G&eacute;ricault painted them for Georget after his return from England to assist his studies in mental illness.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is this last that is generally held to be the most likely. Stylistically, they belong to the period after his stay in England, two years after his breakdown. Also, the unified nature of the series, in terms of their scale, composition and color scheme suggest a clearly defined commission, while the medical concept of &ldquo;monomania&rdquo; shapes the whole design.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Early Modern Psychiatry</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A key figure in early modern psychiatry in France was Jean-Etienne-Dominique Esquirol (1772-1840), whose main area of interest was &ldquo;monomania,&rdquo; a term no longer in clinical use, which described a particular fixation leading sufferers to exhibit delusional behavior, imagining themselves to be a king, for example. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/528d22d27c06d93d134d282dab4f4582ce5b0d86.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault,<em> Portait of a Child Snatcher,</em> 1822, oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm (Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield, Massachusetts)</span></span>Esquirol, who shared a house with his friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Georget, was a great believer in the now largely discredited science of physiognomy, holding that physical appearances could be used to diagnose mental disorders. With this in mind, he had over 200 drawings made of his patients, a group of which, executed by Georges-Francoise Gabriel, were exhibited at the Salon of 1814. As an exhibitor himself that year, it seems highly likely that G&eacute;ricault would have seen them there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Georget&rsquo;s work developed on Esquirol&rsquo;s. &nbsp;An Enlightenment figure, Esquirol rejected moral or theological explanations for mental illness, seeing insanity, neither as the workings of the devil nor as the outcome of moral decrepitude, but as an organic affliction, one that, like any other disease, can be identified by observable physical symptoms. In his book <em>On Madness</em>, published in 1820, following Esquirol, Georget turns to physiognomy to support this theory:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>In general the idiot&rsquo;s face is stupid, without meaning; the face of the manic patient is as agitated as his spirit, often distorted and cramped; the moron&rsquo;s facial characteristics are dejected and without expression; the facial characteristics of the melancholic are pinched, marked by pain or extreme agitation; the monomaniacal king has a proud, inflated expression; the religious fanatic is mild, he exhorts by casting his eyes at the heavens or fixing them on the earth; the anxious patient pleads, glancing sideways, etc.</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The clumsy language here&mdash;&ldquo;the idiot&rsquo;s face is stupid&rdquo;&mdash;seems a world away from G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s extraordinarily sensitive paintings, a point that begs the question whether G&eacute;ricault was doing more than simply following the good doctor&rsquo;s orders in producing the series, but instead making his own independent enquiries.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6c61cfc6bf1185ca13f02e4bf676e234b74a5317.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>Portait of a Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy (The Hyena)</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 72 x 58 cm (Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, Lyons)</span></span>G&eacute;ricault had many reasons to be interested in psychiatry, starting with his own family: his grandfather and one of his uncles had died insane. His experiences while painting <em>The Raft </em>must also have left their mark. The Medusa&rsquo;s surgeon, J.B. Henry Savigny, at the time G&eacute;ricault interviewed him, was writing an account of the psychological impact the experience had had on his fellow passengers and, of course, there was G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s own mental breakdown in 1819. It seems only natural then that he would be drawn to this new and exciting area of scientific study.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Alternatively, some critics argue that G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s work is a propaganda exercise for Georget, designed to demonstrate the importance of psychiatrists in detecting signs of mental illness. In their very subtleties they show just how difficult this can be, requiring a trained eye such as Georget&rsquo;s to come to the correct diagnosis. According to Albert Boime, the paintings were also used to demonstrate the curative effects of psychiatric treatment. If the five missing paintings were ever found, he argues, they would depict the same characters&mdash;but after treatment&mdash;showing their improved state, much like &lsquo;before and after&rsquo; photographs in modern day advertising.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This, of course, is impossible to prove or disprove. What is more challenging is Boime&rsquo;s general criticisms of early psychiatry which, he argues, by classifying, containing and observing people was effective only in silencing the voices of the mentally ill, rendering them invisible and therefore subject to abuse. The fact that the sitters of the paintings are given no names, but are defined only by their illnesses would seem to confirm this view and, for that reason, many modern viewers of the paintings do feel disconcerted when looking at them.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>The Portraits</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>​The five surviving portraits are bust length and in front view, without hands.&nbsp;The canvases vary in dimensions but the heads are all close to life-size.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3e5237809c7828b9f81856d8e776a734e087f8a4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault, <em>Portrait of a Kleptomaniac</em>, 1822, oil on canvas, 61 x 50 cm (Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent)</span></span>The viewpoint is at eye level for the three men but from above for the women, indicating that the paintings were executed in different places.&nbsp;It seems likely that the women were painted in the women&rsquo;s hospital Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, while the men were selected from among the inmates of Charenton and Bicȇtre. &nbsp;None of the sitters is named; they are identified by their malady. None look directly at the viewer, contributing to an uneasy sense of distractedness in their gazes that can be read as stillness, as though they are lost in their own thoughts, or as disconnectedness from the process in which they are involved. These are not patrons and have had no say in how they are depicted.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each is shown in three-quarter profile, some to the left, some to the right. The pose is typical of formal, honorific portraits, effecting a restrained composition that does not make it apparent that they are confined in asylums.

The medallion has no shine to it and the string that it hangs from looks makeshift and worn.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The paintings were executed with great speed, entirely from life and probably in one sitting. &nbsp;Critics often remark on the painterly quality of the work, the extraordinary fluency of brushwork, in contrast with G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s early more sculptural style, suggesting that the erratic brushwork is used to mirror the disordered thoughts of the patients. In places it is applied in almost translucent layers, while in others it is thicker creating highly expressive contrasts in textures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Romantic Scientists</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What perhaps strikes one most about the portraits is the extraordinary empathy we are made to feel for these poor souls, who might not strike us immediately as insane, but who certainly exhibit outward signs of inward suffering.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/29254bf217f00cad67131eeb7e9f56b97a82a7be.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">John Constable, Cloud Study, 1822, oil on paper laid on board, 47.6 x 57.5 cm (Tate Britain)&nbsp;</span></span>In bringing the sensitivity of a great artist to assist scientific enquiry, G&eacute;ricault was not alone among Romantic painters. John Constable&rsquo;s cloud studies, for example, were exactly contemporary with the portraits and provide an interesting parallel. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Both artists capture brilliantly the fleeting moment, the shifting movements in Constable&rsquo;s cumulus, stratus, cirrus and nimbus, in G&eacute;ricault the complex play of emotions on the faces of the insane.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Not since the Renaissance has art illustrated so beautifully the concerns of the scientific domain; in G&eacute;ricault&rsquo;s case teaching those early psychiatrists, we might be tempted to think, to look on their patients with a more human gaze.</p>\n"

"<p>Imagine you pack up your belongings in a sack, tie on your cloak, and start off on a months-long journey though treacherous mountains, unpredictable weather and unknown lands. For the medieval pilgrim, life was a spiritual journey. Why did people in the Middle Ages take pilgrimages? There are many reasons, but visiting a holy site meant being closer to God. And if you were closer to God in this life, you would also be closer to God in the next.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Located in Conques, the Church of Saint-Foy (Saint Faith) is an important pilgrimage church on the route to Santiago de Compostela in Northern Spain. It is also an abbey, meaning that the church was part of a monastery where monks lived, prayed and worked. Only small parts of the monastery have survived but the church remains largely intact. Although smaller churches stood on the site from the seventh century, the Church of Saint-Foy was begun in the eleventh century and completed in the mid-twelfth century. As a Romanesque church, it has a barrel-vaulted nave lined with arches on the interior.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>It is known as a pilgrimage church&nbsp;because many of the large churches long the route to Santiago de Compostela took a similar shape. The main feature of these churches was the cruciform plan. Not only did this plan take the symbolic form of the cross but it also helped control the crowds of pilgrims. In most cases, pilgrims could enter the western portal and then circulate around the church towards the apse at the eastern end. The apse usually contained smaller chapels, known as radiating chapels, where pilgrims could visit saint&rsquo;s shrines, especially the sanctuary of Saint Foy. They could then circulate around the ambulatory and out the transept, or crossing. This design helped to regulate the flow of traffic throughout the church although the intention and effective use of this design has been debated.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Pilgrims arriving in Conques had one thing on their mind: the reliquary of Saint Foy. This reliquary, or container holding the remains of a saint or holy person, was one of the most famous in all of Europe. So famous that it was originally located in a monastery in Agen but the monks at Conques plotted to steal it in order to attract more wealth and visitors. The reliquary at Conques held the remains of Saint Foy, a young Christian convert living in Roman-occupied France during the second century. At the age of twelve, she was condemned to die for her refusal to sacrifice to pagan gods, she is therefore revered&nbsp;as a martyr, as&nbsp;someone who dies for their faith. Saint Foy was a very popular saint in Southern France&nbsp;and her relic&nbsp;was extremely important to&nbsp;the church;&nbsp;bringing pilgrams and wealth to the small, isolated town of Conques.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the date of the reliquary is unknown, Bernard of Angers first spoke it about in 1010. At first, Bernard was frightened that the statue was too beautiful stating, &quot;Brother, what do you think of this idol? Would Jupiter or Mars consider himself unworthy of such a statue?&quot; He was concerned about idolatry&mdash;that pilgrims would begin to worship the jewel-encrusted reliquary rather than what that reliquary contained and represented, the holy figure of Saint Foy. Indeed, the gold and gem encrusted statue would been&nbsp;quite a sight for the pilgrims.&nbsp;Over time, travelers paid homage to Saint Foy by donating&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33 1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: Holly Hayes (CC BY-NC 2.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7598d1c8c3349dc7e3715d46fe699a481d8c44f6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33-1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sacred_destinations/2649842024/in/photostream/\">Holly Hayes </a>(CC BY-NC 2.0)</span></span>gemstones for the reliquary so that her dress is&nbsp;covered with agates, amethysts, crystals, carnelians, emeralds, garnets, hematite, jade, onyx, opals, pearls, rubies, sapphires, topazes, antique cameos and intaglios. Her face, which stares boldly at the viewer, is thought to have originally been the head of a Roman statue of a child. The reuse of older materials in new forms of art is known as spolia. Using spolia was not only practical but it made the object more important by associating it with the past riches of the Roman Empire.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Church of Saint Foy at Conques provides an excellent example of Romanesque art and architecture. Although the monastery no longer survives, the church and treasury stand as a reminder of&nbsp;the rituals of medieval faith, especially for pilgrims. Even today, people make the long trek to Conques to pay respect to Saint Foy. Every October, a great celebration and procession is held for Saint Foy, continuing a medieval tradition into present day devotion.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Pilgrims arriving in Conques had one thing on their mind: the reliquary of Saint Foy. This reliquary, or container holding the remains of a saint or holy person, was one of the most famous in all of Europe. So famous that it was originally located in a monastery in Agen but the monks at Conques plotted to steal it in order to attract more wealth and visitors. The reliquary at Conques held the remains of Saint Foy, a young Christian convert living in Roman-occupied France during the second century. At the age of twelve, she was condemned to die for her refusal to sacrifice to pagan gods, she is therefore revered&nbsp;as a martyr, as&nbsp;someone who dies for their faith. Saint Foy was a very popular saint in Southern France&nbsp;and her relic&nbsp;was extremely important to&nbsp;the church;&nbsp;bringing pilgrams and wealth to the small, isolated town of Conques.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the date of the reliquary is unknown, Bernard of Angers first spoke it about in 1010. At first, Bernard was frightened that the statue was too beautiful stating, &quot;Brother, what do you think of this idol? Would Jupiter or Mars consider himself unworthy of such a statue?&quot; He was concerned about idolatry&mdash;that pilgrims would begin to worship the jewel-encrusted reliquary rather than what that reliquary contained and represented, the holy figure of Saint Foy. Indeed, the gold and gem encrusted statue would been&nbsp;quite a sight for the pilgrims.&nbsp;Over time, travelers paid homage to Saint Foy by donating&nbsp;<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33 1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: Holly Hayes (CC BY-NC 2.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7598d1c8c3349dc7e3715d46fe699a481d8c44f6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Head (detail), Reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy (Saint Faith), late 10th to early 11th century with later additions, gold, silver gilt, jewels, and cameos over a wooden core, 33-1/2 inches (Treasury, Sainte-Foy, Conques), photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sacred_destinations/2649842024/in/photostream/\">Holly Hayes </a>(CC BY-NC 2.0)</span></span>gemstones for the reliquary so that her dress is&nbsp;covered with agates, amethysts, crystals, carnelians, emeralds, garnets, hematite, jade, onyx, opals, pearls, rubies, sapphires, topazes, antique cameos and intaglios. Her face, which stares boldly at the viewer, is thought to have originally been the head of a Roman statue of a child. The reuse of older materials in new forms of art is known as spolia. Using spolia was not only practical but it made the object more important by associating it with the past riches of the Roman Empire.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Church of Saint Foy at Conques provides an excellent example of Romanesque art and architecture. Although the monastery no longer survives, the church and treasury stand as a reminder of&nbsp;the rituals of medieval faith, especially for pilgrims. Even today, people make the long trek to Conques to pay respect to Saint Foy. Every October, a great celebration and procession is held for Saint Foy, continuing a medieval tradition into present day devotion.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>When shots rang out in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, Europe began hurtling towards one of the deadliest conflicts the world has ever seen. Gavrilo Princip&rsquo;s assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, brought long-brewing political tension to a head. By August 4, 1914, the Central Powers (Germany, Bulgaria, Austro-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Entente or Allied Powers (France, Britain, Russia, Italy, and later the United States), were officially engaged in the First World War.</p>\n"

However, like wars throughout history, it inspired a tremendous amount of creative output from artists and writers, civilians and combatants, men and women. Though we may read about dates and numbers when we study historic conflicts, the lived reality of a war becomes much more vivid when we look at the diverse creative expressions it inspires. The varied perspectives represented in the First World War art show us that there was not one single uniform war experience for Britons, whether on the battlefield or at home. In fact, we could say that British artists and writers witnessed and experienced different wars even though only one conflict is recorded in history.

"<p>Propaganda posters often urged men to enlist in the British Army by appealing to ideals of masculinity, heroism, pride, and loyalty. These widely circulated posters relied on a viewer&rsquo;s positive response to imagery of healthy, stalwart soldiers or emblems of the British nation. A propaganda poster asks its viewer to identify with what is depicted, which usually concerns political, gender, and/or social identity.

"<h3>Carrying poetry to war</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>First World War literature also presents a range of perspectives. Rupert Brooke&rsquo;s patriotic &lsquo;1914&rsquo; sonnet sequence became hugely popular in the early years of the war. At the outset of the war, many Britons were touched by the heroic sentiments of the poems, in particular, &ldquo;The Soldier.&rdquo; This poem&rsquo;s combatant speaker assures the reader that his death in battle will mean that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some corner of a foreign field/That is for ever England.&rdquo; Brooke&rsquo;s poems pictured military service and death as purifying and noble. At the start of the war, when such nationalistic feeling was strong, many British soldiers departed for training with a copy of Brooke&rsquo;s poems tucked into their kits. However, after years of devastating losses and with no clear resolution to the seemingly endless fighting, poets depicting the hard reality of the soldier&rsquo;s experience gained more recognition. Wilfred Owen&rsquo;s gloomy 1917 &ldquo;Anthem for Doomed Youth&rdquo; pictures the war&rsquo;s fallen &ldquo;d[ying] as cattle,&rdquo; for example. Siegfried Sassoon&rsquo;s 1918 piece, &ldquo;Counter-Attack,&rdquo; offers us the gruesome vision of a battlefield &ldquo;place rotten with dead&rdquo; where corpses &ldquo;face downward, in the sucking mud,/Wallow&hellip;&rdquo; Sassoon&rsquo;s shocking verbal image recalls the horrible tableau of Nevinson&rsquo;s dead soldiers lying facedown in the mud.</p>\n"

"<p>During the years leading up to the war, many modernists began to turn their attention to their media; writers and authors broke free of traditional parameters of form and imagery and brought the very materials of their crafts to the forefront.

Eliot&rsquo;s poem, &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; Mark Gertler&rsquo;s <em>Merry-Go-Round </em>(above), or Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s <em>Mrs. Dalloway&nbsp;</em>sought to shock, alienate, or provoke audiences and to thereby explore new sensory and intellectual effects in art and literature.</p>\n"

"<p>While the modernist movement had begun prior to the war, the conflict&rsquo;s vast scale, brutality, and costs fascinated many artists and writers.

"\n"
"<p>Women artists and writers played a significant role in documenting civilian and service experiences. Vera Brittain, who volunteered as a nurse, recorded her impressions of work and loss in her memoir, <em>Testament of Youth</em>, one of the war&rsquo;s most recognized autobiographical works.

To recognize individual sacrifices, the British government issued memorial bronze plaques and paper scrolls to the family of each serviceperson who died as a result of the war. And, on November 11, 1920, a solemn ceremony dedicated two of Britain&rsquo;s most famous public war monuments, Edward Lutyens&rsquo;s <em>Whitehall Cenotaph</em> and the<em> Unknown Soldier</em>, buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>\n"

We know that the central figure is an Oba because of his distinctive coral beaded regalia. Also, attendants hold shields above his head, either to protect him from attack or possibly from the hot, tropical sun. This was a privilege only afforded to an Oba.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figures around him range in size, not because of their actual height or distance from the Oba, but rather due to their level of importance within the court. This convention of sizing human figures based on status is known as &ldquo;hieratic scale&rdquo; and is found in artwork from cultures around the world and across time. The Oba would have travelled with a large cohort of attendants, warriors, servants, diplomats, chieftains, and priests. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The plaque originally hung alongside many others on posts throughout the palace of the Oba. The order of their placement on these posts would have told the history of the royal lineage of Benin&rsquo;s Obas, who traced their dynasty all the way back to Oranmiyan, whose son was the first Oba of Benin. However, the sequence of plaques is lost to us since they were long held in storage when found by westerners in the 19th century. You may notice that the Oba rides sidesaddle on horseback, which would seem to indicate a connection to Oba Esigie (who ruled c. 1504-1550), the first Oba to travel by horse. However, without knowing the original order of the plaques, we will never know for certain whether this was Esigie, or a later Oba who emulated his brash new mode of travel.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Artists working in brass were organized under Esigie. Today, artists working in brass in Benin are part of a brass workers guild, and it was likely that previous generations would have also worked collectively. These artists created plaques and other sculptures using what is known as the &ldquo;lost wax casting technique,&rdquo; in which, first, a more malleable wax version of the final brass work is made. It is then covered in clay and fired to harden the clay, removing the wax, which melts away in the process (hence the term, &ldquo;lost wax&rdquo;). Hot, molten liquid brass is then poured into the clay mold. As the brass cools, it hardens, and the clay is removed, revealing the finished plaque.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>&nbsp;What would you consider today&rsquo;s most coveted status symbols? A Mercedes or a Ferrari, a diamond Rolex or a designer handbag? A European villa? In Rachel Ruysch&rsquo;s day it was a simple tulip. Looking at her floral still life paintings can reveal an entire hidden world&mdash;of wealth, status, even the economics of the world&rsquo;s first financial crises.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Growing Up: Art + Science</h3>\n"
"\n"

Her father, Frederik Ruysch, was an eminent scientist and professor of anatomy and botany. He possessed a well-known collection of rare natural history specimens, which Rachel helped catalogue and record. He encouraged her artistic talents, careful observation of the natural world and scientifically accurate renderings of plants and flowers.&nbsp;<span>At age fifteen, Ruysch began an apprenticeship with famous still life painter Willem van Aelst. By eighteen, she was already producing her first still life paintings and starting to establish her long and successful career.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Working Mother</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At twenty nine, Rusch married portrait painter Juriaen Pool, with whom she had ten children. Despite her enormous domestic responsibilities, she was remarkably prolific, producing more than 250 paintings over seven decades. Her works were in great demand, and she achieved widespread fame and international recognition. Considered one of the most successful artists of her day, contemporary Dutch writers called her &ldquo;Holland&rsquo;s art prodigy&rdquo; and &ldquo;our subtle art heroine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Consumer Society</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1648, the Netherlands became independent from Spain, ushering in a period of great economic prosperity. Flourishing international trade and a thriving capitalistic economy resulted in a newly affluent middle class. Wealthy merchants created a new kind of patronage and art market. Without a powerful monarchy or the Catholic Church to commission artworks (the Dutch were Protestants), artists produced directly for buyers. Like today, buyers purchased art either from professional dealers or from the artist in their studios. Subjects like big historical, mythological or religious paintings were no longer desired; buyers wanted portraits, still lifes, landscapes and genre paintings (scenes of everyday life) to decorate their homes. Proud of their newly independent country and trade wealth, they desired artworks that would reflect their success. In a competitive open market, artists began to specialize. Rachel Ruysch became known as one of the greatest flower painters of her time.</p>\n"

"<h3>&ldquo;Tulip Mania&rdquo;&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Coveted for their intense and unusually varied colors, tulips were introduced into the Netherlands from Turkey in the late 16th century. The Dutch fell madly in love with them. Because it takes so long for a tulip to be grown from seed, demand far outpaced supply. The rarest and most valuable tulips were the variegated or &ldquo;flamed&rdquo; tulips, those with feathers of contrasting color on their petals. This exotic coloration was actually caused by a virus that infected the tulip, shortening its life span and making it even more sought after and valuable. The stage was set for a buying craze.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The word tulip mania is often used today to refer to certain types of economic crises. It describes a financial bubble caused by large numbers of people speculating on unproved commodities or companies. Tulip bulbs were so avidly desired in 17th century Netherlands that a &ldquo;futures market&rdquo; was born. &nbsp;Buyers bought bulbs still in the ground, speculating that they would be worth more in the future and could then be sold for a large profit. Prices rose steadily and irrationally. At the peak of tulip speculation in 1636, some bulbs sold for more than a skilled craftsman earned in ten years. A nursery catalog of the time notes that at the height of the madness, a rare &ldquo;Semper Augustus&rdquo; tulip sold for 5,200 guiders, more than the price of a fine house, a ship or twelve acres of land.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In February, 1637, investors suddenly decided that tulip bulbs were grossly overpriced, and began to sell. Within days, panic ensued. With more sellers than buyers, demand for tulips evaporated. Prices plummeted, tulip bulbs lost 90% of their earlier value, and the market crashed. The world had just experienced its first financial bubble. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<p>A successful Dutch still life painting was highly valued for its degree of skillful realism. <em>Flowers Still Life</em> depicts a profusion of scientifically accurate floral details. Each petal, stem, and leaf is minutely and precisely rendered. Textures are remarkably realistic, from the delicate paper thin poppy petals to the crinkly, brittle leaves. Looking closer still, we see that Ruysch has also meticulously depicted tiny insects: a caterpillar crawls on a stem, a bee gathers pollen from the center of a poppy, a white butterfly alights on a marigold.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><em>Flower&nbsp;Still Life</em> depicts a lush variety of different flowers, from popular common European blooms to rare overseas species. Ruysch combines a complex and intricate arrangement of poppies, snapdragons, roses, carnations, hollyhocks, marigolds, morning glories and a single red and white flamed tulip. Flowers lavishly spill out of the vase, filling the entire picture space. Some are in full bloom, others droop and wilt, as leaves and curving stems entwine throughout.&nbsp;While many of her contemporary flower painters used more symmetrical and formal compositions, Ruysch was known for these lively and informal looking arrangements. The flowers are asymmetrically arranged, leading the eye diagonally from the lower left drooping marigold to the upper right red poppy. Our eye is first attracted to the lightest flowers in the center, then to the brightly colored surrounding flowers, and finally out to the small darker flowers at the edges of the bouquet. Complementary colors create harmony, as warm yellows and rose balance cool blues and greens. Light alternates with shadow, enlivening the flowers as they stand out dramatically against the darker background.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;Vanitas&rdquo;: Hidden Meanings?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some scholars believe there is another way to view Ruysch&rsquo;s flower paintings. One common interpretation is to understand them in light of <em>vanitas</em>, a moral message common at the time. Taken from a passage in the Christian bible, it was a reminder that beauty fades and all living things must die. While still life paintings celebrated the beauty and luxury of fine food or voluptuous flowers, <em>vanitas</em> was a warning about the fleeting nature of these material things and the shortness of life. In <em>Flowers Still Life</em>, some flowers wilt and die while insects have eaten holes in the leaves. Wealthy Dutch consumers were being reminded to not become too attached to their material possessions and worldly pleasures; eternal salvation came only through devotion to God.</p>\n"

"<p>&nbsp;What would you consider today&rsquo;s most coveted status symbols? A Mercedes or a Ferrari, a diamond Rolex or a designer handbag? A European villa? In Rachel Ruysch&rsquo;s day it was a simple tulip. Looking at her floral still life paintings can reveal an entire hidden world&mdash;of wealth, status, even the economics of the world&rsquo;s first financial crises.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Growing Up: Art + Science</h3>\n"
"\n"

Her father, Frederik Ruysch, was an eminent scientist and professor of anatomy and botany. He possessed a well-known collection of rare natural history specimens, which Rachel helped catalogue and record. He encouraged her artistic talents, careful observation of the natural world and scientifically accurate renderings of plants and flowers.&nbsp;<span>At age fifteen, Ruysch began an apprenticeship with famous still life painter Willem van Aelst. By eighteen, she was already producing her first still life paintings and starting to establish her long and successful career.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Working Mother</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At twenty nine, Rusch married portrait painter Juriaen Pool, with whom she had ten children. Despite her enormous domestic responsibilities, she was remarkably prolific, producing more than 250 paintings over seven decades. Her works were in great demand, and she achieved widespread fame and international recognition. Considered one of the most successful artists of her day, contemporary Dutch writers called her &ldquo;Holland&rsquo;s art prodigy&rdquo; and &ldquo;our subtle art heroine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Consumer Society</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1648, the Netherlands became independent from Spain, ushering in a period of great economic prosperity. Flourishing international trade and a thriving capitalistic economy resulted in a newly affluent middle class. Wealthy merchants created a new kind of patronage and art market. Without a powerful monarchy or the Catholic Church to commission artworks (the Dutch were Protestants), artists produced directly for buyers. Like today, buyers purchased art either from professional dealers or from the artist in their studios. Subjects like big historical, mythological or religious paintings were no longer desired; buyers wanted portraits, still lifes, landscapes and genre paintings (scenes of everyday life) to decorate their homes. Proud of their newly independent country and trade wealth, they desired artworks that would reflect their success. In a competitive open market, artists began to specialize. Rachel Ruysch became known as one of the greatest flower painters of her time.</p>\n"

"<p><u>Background</u></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the summer of 2012 and then in the winter of 2013, I traveled to Lima, Peru to train administrators and teachers on the use and implementation of Khan Academy in math classrooms. &nbsp;I learned of this opportunity through the Khan Academy team and accepted the invitation from Innova Schools in Peru. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Innova Schools is an ambitious educational private project in Latin America, planning to become the largest school network in the region by 2018. Currently operating 11 schools in Lima, Peru, the company will have at least 70 world-class schools throughout Peru by 2016. Their vision is to provide affordable high-quality education to Peruvian children, and my role was to help them innovate their math program with Khan Academy.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Innova Schools believe in the Blended Learning model, and they have structured the curriculum, instruction, and experiences of the students to uphold this model. &nbsp;Blended learning is a formal education program in which a student learns at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some element of student control over time, place, path, and/or pace.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To achieve blended learning in the subject of Math, Innova Schools adopted Khan Academy as the online source of content instruction. &nbsp;Innova Schools identify this time of independent learning as Solo-Learning, and twice a week, the students&rsquo; solo-learning activity is using Khan Academy to learn and practice the math curriculum. &nbsp;Innova Schools&rsquo; administrators worked tirelessly alongside a publishing company and teachers to align Khan Academy videos and exercises to the content standards/objectives for each grade. &nbsp;Each day&rsquo;s math lesson is planned out for every grade, and the selected Khan Academy videos and exercises are communicated to students as goals for their weekly Solo-Learning time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>First Trip to Peru: July 2012</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During my first visit to Peru, my main focus and goal was to introduce Khan Academy to Innova School administrators, to a select group of teachers, and then to meet the first cohort of students who&rsquo;d be piloting Khan Academy. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I began showing the Innova Schools administrators how using Khan Academy supports their Blended Learning model. &nbsp;Then, I gave them a tour of Khan Academy and explained all the resources available through Khan Academy for student and teacher support. &nbsp;I helped them navigate the dashboard and showed them the numerous layers of data available for teachers to use for student-centered learning. &nbsp;My presentation was videotaped so that it could be used again with different audiences. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I was then introduced to two math teachers who were chosen to be the first to pilot Khan Academy in their classes. &nbsp;Like I was at the very beginning, these teachers knew the potential of Khan Academy, but they were unsure how to use it in a practical way in the classroom. &nbsp;Each teacher had spent time watching videos, working on exercises, and touring the dashboard, but they needed a plan, a structure, and a system of how to make it work in the classroom. &nbsp;With these teachers, I began by empathizing with their fears and confusion. &nbsp;Once we knew that we were all on the same page, I shared the teacher-guide I had created to walk the teachers through the steps for implementation. &nbsp;A helpful coach at Innova Schools helped me translate the guide into Spanish! &nbsp;I shared my system of unit packets, unit lands, folders, journals, pre-tests, post-tests, Swiss Cheese, the Help board, peer tutoring, active listening lessons, and a step by step example of a day&rsquo;s math instruction using Khan Academy. &nbsp;The teachers took notes, asked many questions, practiced on their own, and as time passed, their faces became calm and assured as everything began to make sense. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>I also shared many project ideas and ways to teach problem solving and critical thinking skills. &nbsp;Like I was in the very beginning, they were also concerned about ways to incorporate and develop more conceptual understanding in their students. &nbsp;The days of Solo-Learning without Khan Academy are devoted to project-based learning and problem solving skills. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I was also fortunate enough to meet the actual students who&rsquo;d be piloting Khan Academy. &nbsp;They had heard about it and simply knew it to be something very good. &nbsp;My job was to get them pumped up; I let them know that they were amongst the first in their country to embark on a new way of learning. &nbsp;This energized them, but the real energy came when they found out they&rsquo;d have their own computer laptops! &nbsp;The cheers were deafening and the smiles were contagious. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After these workshops, these teachers went to their classrooms and began the Khan Academy implementation process in their math classes. &nbsp;Like me, they hadn&rsquo;t grasped everything 100% before they started; they just started. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>Second Trip to Peru: &nbsp;February 2013</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During my second trip to Peru, I had Khan Academy workshops for the next group of teachers, school principals, and math coaches. &nbsp;During this trip, I not only visited Innova Schools in Lima, but traveled to Innova Schools in surrounding towns several hours away. &nbsp;I met principals, coaches, and teachers, and together, we learned about blended learning and Khan Academy. &nbsp;They were jazzed up knowing that they were at the forefront of education innovation, and they were ready to take a risk and try something new. &nbsp;Like me, they also knew that teaching had become entirely too teacher-centered, and they also struggled knowing that they weren&rsquo;t reaching every students&rsquo; needs. &nbsp;They were ready for a change. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>Afterthoughts</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In these two trips to Peru, I was encouraged and strengthened by the common language and unique experiences that all teachers share. &nbsp;Their faces and expressions were familiar to me; and though the language barrier separated us from verbal communication, I know that all of us knew that we were all in this together. &nbsp;We shared a purpose and mission, and we knew that we were there to help one another toward the common goal of excellence in education. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I&rsquo;m warmed at the thought of these Innova teachers using Khan Academy in their classrooms and then being able to teach other teachers how to use Khan Academy as well. &nbsp;And so, the motivation and inspiration to use Khan Academy in the blended learning model of math instruction reaches more and more teachers and therefore more and more students in Peru and all around the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>I was then introduced to two math teachers who were chosen to be the first to pilot Khan Academy in their classes. &nbsp;Like I was at the very beginning, these teachers knew the potential of Khan Academy, but they were unsure how to use it in a practical way in the classroom. &nbsp;Each teacher had spent time watching videos, working on exercises, and touring the dashboard, but they needed a plan, a structure, and a system of how to make it work in the classroom. &nbsp;With these teachers, I began by empathizing with their fears and confusion. &nbsp;Once we knew that we were all on the same page, I shared the teacher-guide I had created to walk the teachers through the steps for implementation. &nbsp;A helpful coach at Innova Schools helped me translate the guide into Spanish! &nbsp;I shared my system of unit packets, unit lands, folders, journals, pre-tests, post-tests, Swiss Cheese, the Help board, peer tutoring, active listening lessons, and a step by step example of a day&rsquo;s math instruction using Khan Academy. &nbsp;The teachers took notes, asked many questions, practiced on their own, and as time passed, their faces became calm and assured as everything began to make sense. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>I also shared many project ideas and ways to teach problem solving and critical thinking skills. &nbsp;Like I was in the very beginning, they were also concerned about ways to incorporate and develop more conceptual understanding in their students. &nbsp;The days of Solo-Learning without Khan Academy are devoted to project-based learning and problem solving skills. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I was also fortunate enough to meet the actual students who&rsquo;d be piloting Khan Academy. &nbsp;They had heard about it and simply knew it to be something very good. &nbsp;My job was to get them pumped up; I let them know that they were amongst the first in their country to embark on a new way of learning. &nbsp;This energized them, but the real energy came when they found out they&rsquo;d have their own computer laptops! &nbsp;The cheers were deafening and the smiles were contagious. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After these workshops, these teachers went to their classrooms and began the Khan Academy implementation process in their math classes. &nbsp;Like me, they hadn&rsquo;t grasped everything 100% before they started; they just started. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>Second Trip to Peru: &nbsp;February 2013</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During my second trip to Peru, I had Khan Academy workshops for the next group of teachers, school principals, and math coaches. &nbsp;During this trip, I not only visited Innova Schools in Lima, but traveled to Innova Schools in surrounding towns several hours away. &nbsp;I met principals, coaches, and teachers, and together, we learned about blended learning and Khan Academy. &nbsp;They were jazzed up knowing that they were at the forefront of education innovation, and they were ready to take a risk and try something new. &nbsp;Like me, they also knew that teaching had become entirely too teacher-centered, and they also struggled knowing that they weren&rsquo;t reaching every students&rsquo; needs. &nbsp;They were ready for a change. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><u>Afterthoughts</u></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In these two trips to Peru, I was encouraged and strengthened by the common language and unique experiences that all teachers share. &nbsp;Their faces and expressions were familiar to me; and though the language barrier separated us from verbal communication, I know that all of us knew that we were all in this together. &nbsp;We shared a purpose and mission, and we knew that we were there to help one another toward the common goal of excellence in education. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I&rsquo;m warmed at the thought of these Innova teachers using Khan Academy in their classrooms and then being able to teach other teachers how to use Khan Academy as well. &nbsp;And so, the motivation and inspiration to use Khan Academy in the blended learning model of math instruction reaches more and more teachers and therefore more and more students in Peru and all around the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>New Technologies</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although on the face of it, the Museum might seem to be a very conservative building, the manner in which it was constructed was anything but. Smirke, for instance, was one of the first architects to make extensive use of concrete, laying it as a base for the cast iron frame that underpins the entire structure, a frame that was then filled with London stock brick and covered in a facing of Portland stone,<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/401d6350ef493bfcfe137085b78cd8180cb05ff4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Weston Hall, 1845-47, The British Museum (London)</span></span> brought all the way from Dorset.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the design of the interior, too, which was overseen by Smirke&rsquo;s brother, Sydney from 1845 onwards, British materials were used throughout, the floor of the entrance hall&mdash;the Weston Hall&mdash;being paved with York stone, the staircase balustrade and ornamental vases carved from Huddlestone stone and the sides of the Grand Staircase lined with red Aberdeen granite. While, the fact that these materials were all sourced from the British Isles reinforced the nationalist message, the vivid colours of the stones themselves created a luminous interior that was further adorned with colorful designs based on those found on classical buildings, which by the nineteenth century were known to be polychromatic. The original stonework has all survived to this day, while the 1847 painting and gilding was restored in 2000. The electric lamps in the hall are also replicas of the original, installed in 1879, making the Museum one of the first public buildings in London to be electrically lit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Reading Room</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the 1850s, with the collection continuing to expand, the site needed a yet larger library, the idea this time being to construct a round room in the central courtyard. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d99be86f90777578a8b4d8c434a8ff6678b08036.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Reading Room, 1854-7, The British Museum (London)</span></span>Designed by Sydney Smirke, the Reading Room was built between 1854-1857. Given the size of it, 42.6m in diameter, the speed of construction, even assisted by modern building techniques, was astounding. Using cast iron, concrete and glass, it was a masterpiece of nineteenth-century technology, inspired as much by Paxton&rsquo;s ferrovitreous Crystal Palace as by the Pantheon in Rome; the airy and graceful internal dome disguising the complex fretwork of cast iron that supported it from without. Even the bookshelves were state-of-the-art, built of iron to carry the weight of the books and making up a staggering three miles of cases and twenty-five miles of shelving.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Recent Times</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This was not the end of the story, though. In 1997, the books were relocated yet again to the newly built British Library on Euston Road and the old Reading Room transformed into an exhibition space, a move that provided the catalyst to revitalise the old courtyard. In 2000, Foster and Partner&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II Great Court was opened and the two buildings, the Museum and the Reading Room, were now connected with a huge glazed canopy spanning the two acres of the courtyard. And the story still continues, for even more recently yet more changes have been made, with the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centres, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners, due to open in 2014.</span><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beedf6420cb14db2fb3f8591a7084c3644f5c0ce.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Foster and Partners, Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, 1997</span></span>That the site is a constantly evolving one is only to be expected, given the ever-changing nature of the collection itself. An astonishing compendium of 260 years of human discoveries, the British Museum is indeed a house filled with many mansions, the outside of which, in the last analysis, however brilliant and varied in its construction it may be, will never come close to matching the glories within.</p>\n"

While, the fact that these materials were all sourced from the British Isles reinforced the nationalist message, the vivid colours of the stones themselves created a luminous interior that was further adorned with colorful designs based on those found on classical buildings, which by the nineteenth century were known to be polychromatic. The original stonework has all survived to this day, while the 1847 painting and gilding was restored in 2000. The electric lamps in the hall are also replicas of the original, installed in 1879, making the Museum one of the first public buildings in London to be electrically lit.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Reading Room</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the 1850s, with the collection continuing to expand, the site needed a yet larger library, the idea this time being to construct a round room in the central courtyard. <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d99be86f90777578a8b4d8c434a8ff6678b08036.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sydney Smirke, The Reading Room, 1854-7, The British Museum (London)</span></span>Designed by Sydney Smirke, the Reading Room was built between 1854-1857. Given the size of it, 42.6m in diameter, the speed of construction, even assisted by modern building techniques, was astounding. Using cast iron, concrete and glass, it was a masterpiece of nineteenth-century technology, inspired as much by Paxton&rsquo;s ferrovitreous Crystal Palace as by the Pantheon in Rome; the airy and graceful internal dome disguising the complex fretwork of cast iron that supported it from without. Even the bookshelves were state-of-the-art, built of iron to carry the weight of the books and making up a staggering three miles of cases and twenty-five miles of shelving.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Recent Times</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This was not the end of the story, though. In 1997, the books were relocated yet again to the newly built British Library on Euston Road and the old Reading Room transformed into an exhibition space, a move that provided the catalyst to revitalise the old courtyard. In 2000, Foster and Partner&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II Great Court was opened and the two buildings, the Museum and the Reading Room, were now connected with a huge glazed canopy spanning the two acres of the courtyard. And the story still continues, for even more recently yet more changes have been made, with the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centres, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners, due to open in 2014.</span><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beedf6420cb14db2fb3f8591a7084c3644f5c0ce.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Foster and Partners, Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, 1997</span></span>That the site is a constantly evolving one is only to be expected, given the ever-changing nature of the collection itself. An astonishing compendium of 260 years of human discoveries, the British Museum is indeed a house filled with many mansions, the outside of which, in the last analysis, however brilliant and varied in its construction it may be, will never come close to matching the glories within.</p>\n"

Painted largely out of doors at the &quot;Lover&rsquo;s Seat&quot; (a scenic outlook) above Covehurst Bay near Hastings on the south coast of England, the scene captures a tranquil spot inhabited only by a flock of sheep.

"\n"
"<p>Hunt captures the beauty of an English summer day. The brightness of the sunlight is interrupted only by the shadows of the clouds they move across the landscape. The sea glitters in the distance on the far left. The cliffs are pushed up to the top of the picture frame, leaving little room for the sky.

"\n"
"<h3>Pre-Raphaelite Truth to Nature</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>True to the ideals of Pre-Raphaelitism, Hunt painted every flower, bramble and blade of grass with extreme attention to detail. The texture gives the impression that you could reach out feel the uneven clumps of wool on the sheep, and Hunt even pays attention to the red marking, used to differentiate ownership, on each member of the flock. Hunt, who had introduced the Pre-Raphaelites to the ideas of John Ruskin, was perhaps the most faithful follower of Ruskin&rsquo;s advice to &ldquo;go to Nature in all singleness of heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n"
"&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Political and Moral Content</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Also following in the tradition of Ruskin is the fact that the painting carries a moral content. The title <em>Our English Coasts</em> related to the fact that at the time of the unguarded state of the many miles of English coastline was a serious topic of discussion at the time. The European revolutions of 1848 had made Britons nervous, and it was as yet unclear what the relationship was to be with France&rsquo;s new ruler Napoleon III.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Hunt and the Pre-Raphaelites</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Hunt was born in London in 1827 and became a student at the Royal Academy School in 1844, where he met Millais. He also became a close friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti when the two bonded over a mutual regard for the work of the poet Keats.

In contrast, the word &quot;subjective&quot; is directly linked to personal experience.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Here is an example. Imagine a minor accident between a taxi and a city bus. A patrolman comes along to reconstruct the event. Does he only ask the cab driver what took place or does he also ask the passenger in the back of the cab and the bus driver and the riders on the bus? The cop&#39;s goal is the reconstruct what &quot;actually&quot; happened. But if we take a post-Cartesian position we might ask whether there really was a single actual (objective) event or whether there were actually multiple (subjective) truths, each the result of each witness&#39;s perspective. Let&#39;s take a more directly applicable example. Look about the room that you are currently in. It probably has six sides: four walls, a floor, and a ceiling. When an architect drew a diagram of your room, he/she would have conceptually stepped outside of the space so that it could be understood in total.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>C&eacute;zanne and subjective experience</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c6bbe0aa69f82c857d35b654e616761c40de3e7b.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Paul C&eacute;zanne, detail&nbsp;<em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, c. 1894 oil on canvas, 70.6 x 57.3 cm&nbsp;(Courtauld Gallery, London)</span></span>But is this objective view a false one? Now in the built room, you cannot see its totality in a single moment. We can only see bits and pieces of the room at any one time and must rely upon memory to understand the room as a whole. Your more subjective experience has historically been considered less important than the architect&#39;s objective conception even though you experience directly and the architect knows the room only theoretically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Regarding the traditional heirarchical relationship between objective and subjective, C&eacute;zanne seems to ask, &quot;which is more true?&quot; and his conclusion mirrors an important development of modernism. In <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, it is the subjective view that constructs the space. C&eacute;zanne has placed a plaster cast (copy) of an ancient Roman sculpture of a cupid (the son of Venus) on a tabletop so that it dominates the composition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2326b6bd3dc46788fc6bd71294e72298f86314bd.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Paul C&eacute;zanne, detail <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, c. 1894 oil on canvas, 70.6 x 57.3 cm&nbsp;(Courtauld Gallery, London)</span></span>To an artist of the 19th century such classical sculpture would refer to the great humanist triumph of the Greeks and Romans and the birth of naturalism. In fact, one of the most prominant features of such sculpture would be its contraposto (you remember this: axial shifts responding to weight borne by one leg). Actually, C&eacute;zanne&#39;s li&#39;l god-ling is also twisting at the waist, creating a subtle spiral torsion. Again, the space is odd, the floor especially, seems to rise up too steeply with the stacked canvases forming its uneven perimeter. Have you noticed that the canvases that line the floor, shape the space of the room and that this &quot;shaping&quot; is related to the twisting of the cupid? Let do this point by point. The right foot of the sculpture points roughly towards us and aligns, more or less, with the receeding orthoganol of the table. The figure&#39;s hips have turned. They are aligned with the plane of the canvas at the extreme left that is partly hidden behind the blue tablecloth. The Cupid&#39;s shoulders are turned even further and align with the canvas that rests behind the godling&#39;s torso.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This is clearly not the objective space of the architect. C&eacute;zanne has clearly sought to match the perception of space to the movement of the the body. But isn&#39;t that what we really experience? When you walk into a room, do you see the room as an objective whole? No. We can only see a fragment at a time. But as we&#39;ve already established, we don&#39;t actually see in fragements we see continuously and space is shaped by our continuous movement through it. Try it. Focus on any straight line in the room you are now in. Lean forward, and as you might expect, the angles of the room shift. In <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, we see C&eacute;zanne&#39;s attempt to render true human vision, vision that is subjective, continuous, and informed by memory.<br />\n"

When an architect drew a diagram of your room, he/she would have conceptually stepped outside of the space so that it could be understood in total.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>C&eacute;zanne and subjective experience</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c6bbe0aa69f82c857d35b654e616761c40de3e7b.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Paul C&eacute;zanne, detail&nbsp;<em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, c. 1894 oil on canvas, 70.6 x 57.3 cm&nbsp;(Courtauld Gallery, London)</span></span>But is this objective view a false one? Now in the built room, you cannot see its totality in a single moment. We can only see bits and pieces of the room at any one time and must rely upon memory to understand the room as a whole. Your more subjective experience has historically been considered less important than the architect&#39;s objective conception even though you experience directly and the architect knows the room only theoretically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Regarding the traditional heirarchical relationship between objective and subjective, C&eacute;zanne seems to ask, &quot;which is more true?&quot; and his conclusion mirrors an important development of modernism. In <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, it is the subjective view that constructs the space. C&eacute;zanne has placed a plaster cast (copy) of an ancient Roman sculpture of a cupid (the son of Venus) on a tabletop so that it dominates the composition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2326b6bd3dc46788fc6bd71294e72298f86314bd.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Paul C&eacute;zanne, detail <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, c. 1894 oil on canvas, 70.6 x 57.3 cm&nbsp;(Courtauld Gallery, London)</span></span>To an artist of the 19th century such classical sculpture would refer to the great humanist triumph of the Greeks and Romans and the birth of naturalism. In fact, one of the most prominant features of such sculpture would be its contraposto (you remember this: axial shifts responding to weight borne by one leg). Actually, C&eacute;zanne&#39;s li&#39;l god-ling is also twisting at the waist, creating a subtle spiral torsion. Again, the space is odd, the floor especially, seems to rise up too steeply with the stacked canvases forming its uneven perimeter. Have you noticed that the canvases that line the floor, shape the space of the room and that this &quot;shaping&quot; is related to the twisting of the cupid? Let do this point by point. The right foot of the sculpture points roughly towards us and aligns, more or less, with the receeding orthoganol of the table. The figure&#39;s hips have turned. They are aligned with the plane of the canvas at the extreme left that is partly hidden behind the blue tablecloth. The Cupid&#39;s shoulders are turned even further and align with the canvas that rests behind the godling&#39;s torso.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This is clearly not the objective space of the architect. C&eacute;zanne has clearly sought to match the perception of space to the movement of the the body. But isn&#39;t that what we really experience? When you walk into a room, do you see the room as an objective whole? Não. We can only see a fragment at a time. But as we&#39;ve already established, we don&#39;t actually see in fragements we see continuously and space is shaped by our continuous movement through it. Try it. Focus on any straight line in the room you are now in. Lean forward, and as you might expect, the angles of the room shift. In <em>Still Life with Plaster Cupid</em>, we see C&eacute;zanne&#39;s attempt to render true human vision, vision that is subjective, continuous, and informed by memory.<br />\n"

How much has the world changed since when you were a kid? There was no internet, and no personal computers. Your parents didn&rsquo;t own a minivan or SUV&mdash;those didn&rsquo;t exist yet. Commercial airplanes were brand new. The world was still recovering from World War II, and if you lived in the United States you likely lived in mortal fear of a nuclear attack from the USSR. Life in 2013 may resemble life in 1950 in some ways, but there&rsquo;s no question the world is a different place, a more advanced, stranger place.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Industrial Revolution Changed Everything</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>That was the point of view of British artist Joseph Mallord William Turner (commonly known by his initials J.M.W.) in 1839. J.M.W. Turner was born in 1775, less than a month after the start of the American Revolutionary War. He grew up in a United Kingdom whose empire stretched across the globe under the watchful eye of its navy, and whose military prowess was encouraged by a booming economy driven by the Industrial Revolution.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Industrial Revolution, between roughly 1760 and 1830, brought great positive change to Great Britain. Steam power heralded a machine age filled with factories and mechanical processes. Innovations in textile machinery increased industrial output thousands of times, iron became cheap and strong enough to become an everyday building material, and gas lamps meant people could be active at all hours of the day and night. Populations increased, consumer goods became more affordable, and the middle class exploded. There was a palpable understanding that the world was changing forever.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, not all things improved. Even though the average income grew during the industrial age, standards of living plummeted for most, as did conditions in urban housing and in the new factories. Child labor was not only legal, it was expected. Despite its economic successes, the Industrial Revolution was not without serious problems.</p>\n"

Stanfield may have depicted the Temeraire, illuminated in the foreground and flying the British flag.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ambiguity was on Turner&rsquo;s mind when he began work on his painting, whose full title is&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up</em>,<em> 1838</em>. He was familiar with the namesake ship, HMS Temeraire, as were all Britons of the day. Temeraire was the hero of the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where Napoleon&#39;s forces were defeated, and which secured British naval dominance for the next century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the late 1830s, however, Temeraire was no longer relevant. After retiring from service in 1812 she was converted into a hulk, a ship that can float but not actually sail. She spent time as a prison ship, housing ship, and storage depot before she was finally decommissioned in 1838 and sent up the River Thames to a shipyard in London to be broken into scrap materials. That trip on the Thames was witnessed by Turner, who used it as inspiration for his famous painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Clash of Technology</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For many Britons, Temeraire was a powerful reminder of their nation&rsquo;s long history of military success and a living connection to the heroes of the Napoleonic Wars. Its disassembly signaled the end of an historical era. Turner celebrates Temeraire&rsquo;s heroic past, and he also depicts a technological change which had already begun to affect modern-day life in a more profound way than any battle.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rather than placing Temeraire in the middle of his canvas, Turner paints the warship near the left edge of the canvas. He uses shades of white, grey, and brown for the boat, making it look almost like a ghost ship. The mighty warship is being pulled along by a tiny black tugboat, whose steam engine is more than strong enough to control its larger counterpart. Turner transforms the scene into an allegory about how the new steam power of the Industrial Revolution quickly replaced history and tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Believe it or not, tugboats were so new that there wasn&rsquo;t even a word for what the little ship was doing to Temeraire. According to the&nbsp;Oxford English Dictionary, Turner&rsquo;s title for his painting is the first ever recorded use of the word &ldquo;tugged&rdquo; to describe a steamship pulling another boat.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to the inventive title, Turner included in the exhibition catalog the following lines of text, which he modified from a poem by Thomas Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ye Mariners of England&rdquo;:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The flag which braved the battle and the breeze<br />\n"
"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No long owns her</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This was literally true: Temeraire flies a white flag instead of the British flag, indicating it has been sold by the military to a private company. Furthermore, the poem acknowledges that the ship now has a different function. Temeraire used to be a warship, but no more.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Creative Adaptation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In 1838 Temeraire was towed approximately 55 miles from its coastal dock to a London shipyard, and untold numbers of Britons would have witnessed the ship&rsquo;s final journey. However, the Temeraire they saw only lightly resembled the mighty warship depicted by Turner. In reality her masts had already been removed, as had all other ornamentation and everything else of value on the ship&rsquo;s exterior and interior. Only her barren shell was tugged to London.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Strong contrast is also visible in the way Turner applied paint to the various portions of his canvas. Temeraire is highly detailed.

"\n"
"<h3>The Artist as a Warship</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Turner thought <em>The Fighting Temeraire</em> was one of his more important works. He never sold it, instead keeping it in his studio along with many of his other canvases. When he died in 1851 he bequeathed it and the rest of the paintings he owned to the nation. It<em>&nbsp;</em>quickly became seen as an image of Britain&rsquo;s relationship to industrialization. Steam power has proved itself to be much stronger and more efficient than old technology, but that efficiency came with the cost of centuries of proud tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beyond its national importance,<em>&nbsp;The Fighting Temeraire</em>&nbsp;is also a personal reflection by the artist on his own career. Turner was 64 when he painted it. He&rsquo;d been exhibiting at the Royal Academy of Arts since he was 15, and became a member at age 24, later taking a position as Professor of Painting. However, the year before he painted&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire</em>&nbsp;Turner resigned his professorship, and largely lived in secrecy and seclusion.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although Turner remained one of the most famous artists in England until his death, by the late 1830s he may have thought he was being superseded by younger artists working in drastically different styles. He may have become nostalgic for the country he grew up in, compared to the one in which he then lived.&nbsp;<em>Rain, Steam, and Speed&nbsp;- The Great Western Railway</em>&nbsp;would reflect a similar interest in the changing British landscape several years later, focusing on the dynamic nature of technology.&nbsp;<em>The Fighting Temeraire</em>&nbsp;presents a mournful vision of what technology had replaced, for better or for worse.</p>\n"

"<h3>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture?&quot;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture? The style is a mixture of Moorish, Tartar, Gothic, and Chinese and all in stone and iron. It is a whim which has already cost &pound;700,000, and it is still not ﬁt to live in.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^1</code>&nbsp;Such was the verdict of the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich on the eclectic, exotic and sensuous Royal Pavilion at Brighton.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While not all the contemporary reactions to the Pavilion were critical,&nbsp;John Evans, for example, admired it for both its &quot;beauty&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;grandeur,&quot;​<code class=\"latex\">^2</code>​&nbsp;it was a building which provoked a predominantly critical response in Regency England (in political terms the period from 1811 to 1820 when George, Prince of Wales&mdash;future George IV&mdash;ruled in place of his ailing father George III; and in cultural terms up until the death of George IV in 1830).&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;New Brighton Guide</em>&nbsp;called it a&nbsp;&quot;masterpiece of bad taste&quot;&nbsp;while the&nbsp;Comtesse de Boigne declared it a&nbsp;&quot;mad-house.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^3</code>&nbsp;And when Queen Victoria first visited the Royal Pavilion in 1837, she noted,&nbsp;&quot;The Pavilion is a strange, odd, Chinese looking place, both outside and inside. Most of the rooms are low, and I can see a morsel of the sea, from one of my sitting room windows.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^4</code></p>\n"

"<h3>The patron: the Prince Regent</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ostensible aesthetic randomness of the Pavilion is best comprehended as the material expression of the profligate and rebellious life of its extraordinary benefactor, the Prince Regent, the future George IV, undoubtedly the greatest royal patron of the arts since King Charles I. A man of easy wit and charm, as well as political indolence and questionable morals, the Prince was the touchstone of style for the fashion-conscious Georgian elite of the day. He first visited the seaside resort of Brighton in 1783 to benefit from its reputedly medicinal waters. Captivated by the picturesque promise of the area, the Prince purchased a &quot;superior farmhouse&quot;&nbsp;in 1786 and engaged the royal architect Henry Holland to convert this modest building into a Neo-classical &quot;marine pavilion&quot;&nbsp;fit for a royal personage at play. Under the influence of the Prince Regent, William Porden, Nash&rsquo;s assistant, added a large stables and riding school in the Indian-style which would be the decorative prototype for the &quot;Oriental&quot;&nbsp;incarnation of the Royal Pavilion by its&nbsp;principal architect, John Nash.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The architect: John Nash</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>John Nash was the perfect professional partner for the Pavilion&rsquo;s colorful patron. Subsequently criticised for an overly fashionable&nbsp;and reckless approach to architectural practice, and a resultant lack of purity in the finished product, Nash had planned Regent&rsquo;s Street and Regent&rsquo;s Park in London as a celebration of the rise of the new consumer classes.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Nash&rsquo;s vision for Brighton was informed by the Prince&rsquo;s aesthetic sensibilities and colorful personality and the architect&rsquo;s own experiences of the Picturesque (the beauty inherent in unspoilt nature, as first outlined by the artist William Gilpin), as well as the aquatints of &quot;hindoo&quot;&nbsp;architecture which appeared in the six-volume <em>Oriental Scenery</em> by the landscape painters Thomas and William Daniell at the end of the 18th century. The result was the so-called &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style, comprised of an assortment of architectural and design forms and motifs taken from Britain&rsquo;s colonial experience of the &quot;Orient.&quot;<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Without denying the central agency of both the bold-thinking Nash and fashion-conscious Prince Regent in the design of the Royal Pavilion, the range and variety of architectural styles should be viewed within the context of a&nbsp;wider cultural tradition just then emerging. This exotic mad-house was a response to the early&nbsp;British Empire and its&nbsp;East India Company (a trading company established in 1600 with a&nbsp;fleet of ships and an army&nbsp;200,000 strong)&nbsp;that facillitated the rule of&nbsp;the Indian sub-continent for some two-hundred years and&nbsp;which&nbsp;shaped the British Empire.&nbsp;Here was trade from the East, a rich complex of cultural interchange, and a fascination for the &quot;Orient&quot;&nbsp;in its widest, and loosest, colonial meaning. As the architectural historian Ian Sutton has written, in the nineteenth-century, &quot;Both&nbsp;[architects] and their patrons were assailed by new temptations which they found difficult to resist.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^5</code></p>\n"

"<p>Both buildings pre-date the Pavilion. Moreover, juxtaposing a culturally alien interior to the exterior was not a new idea, and was in some sense&nbsp;a colonial interpretation of the cultures of the lands of Empire. Henry Holland&#39;s French Neo-classical Carlton House,&nbsp;1783&ndash;96&nbsp;in London, for example, boasted a fine Chinese drawing room.

"<p>What does mark Brighton Pavilion out from the above examples, however, is its fundamental expression of Regency England Romanticism derived from the world of letters. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&rsquo;s opium-fuelled poem &quot;Kubla Khan,&quot; a classic of Romantic literature, published in 1816, famously speaks of the &quot;stately pleasure-dome&quot;&nbsp;of the Mongol ruler. One of the confidants of the Prince Regent was William Beckford, notorious hedonist and author of <em>Vathek: An Arabian Tale</em> (1786), whose earlier story of the outrageous ninth Caliph of Abassides was inspired by both<em> The Arabian Knights</em> and Horace Walpole&rsquo;s <em>The Castle of Oltranto</em> (1764), the latter being the novel that ushered in the Gothic genre in English literature. Indeed, the only true architectural pre-cursor to the Pavilion in this Romantic Gothic tradition is probably Walpole&rsquo;s own <em>Strawberry Hill</em> (see image below), an early example of Gothic Revival architecture, which applies &quot;Gothick&quot;&nbsp;forms and motifs in a similarly imaginative way as the Pavilion.<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Architecturally, the &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior owes much to C.P. Cockerell&rsquo;s Sezincote; however, there is in reality a significant difference which speaks of the changing fashions and the further development of exotic eclecticism in this period. Sezincote is hybridic: it retains a Neo-classical facade (the windows and bays), whilst sporting a turquoise onion-shaped Mughul dome and minarets, typical of Islamic architecture of the Indian sub-continent, such as the Taj Mahal, and features a Hindu-inspired garden, including a temple.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Pavilion&#39;s exterior, on the other hand, is more uniformly Mugul-flavored, albeit shot through with a generic sense of the &quot;Orient&quot;: namely&nbsp;the arabesque profusion of ten domes and ten minarets, supported by a cast iron frame, and the vertical thrust of the building, giving it a sense of lightness and airiness, an almost dream-like temporary tent-like quality, in opposition to the permanent horizontal-axised stout square-blockedness of Sezincote.<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Chinese&quot;&nbsp;interior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As for the interior of the Pavilion, while England&rsquo;s curiosity for Chinese culture pre-dates that of its interest in Indian civilization by almost a century, the former&rsquo;s application to the inside of Nash&rsquo;s building is complex, for we have in fact the Neo-classical, Chinese and Gothic at work together. The Entrance Hall (see image below), for instance, is symmetrically arranged, as per the Neo-classical; while the Long Gallery (see image above) contains a multitude of generic Chinese/Asian features (&quot;Chinoiserie&quot;), including the hexagonal lanterns, the silk tassels and the motif of bamboo and birds on the wallpaper, the work of interior decorator Frederick Crace.</p>\n"

"<h3>Making sense of a &lsquo;mad-house&rsquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Royal Pavilion at Brighton in all its apparent kaleidoscopic silliness, brashness, vitality, phantasamagoric contradictions and oppositions, references, and tries&mdash;though not always succeeds&mdash;to respond to the tastes of a new fashionable elite at home and to make sense (or not) of a new world of empire abroad. Indeed, in all its range and variety, as well as in its playful eccentricities, it is quite possibly the ultimate architectural manifestation of early nineteenth-century eclecticism, as well as being the material personification of a powerful Regency personality and his private architect. The history of architecture in Britain is all the richer as a result.</p>\n"

"<h3>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture?&quot;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;How can one describe such a piece of architecture? The style is a mixture of Moorish, Tartar, Gothic, and Chinese and all in stone and iron. It is a whim which has already cost &pound;700,000, and it is still not ﬁt to live in.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^1</code>&nbsp;Such was the verdict of the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich on the eclectic, exotic and sensuous Royal Pavilion at Brighton.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While not all the contemporary reactions to the Pavilion were critical,&nbsp;John Evans, for example, admired it for both its &quot;beauty&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;grandeur,&quot;​<code class=\"latex\">^2</code>​&nbsp;it was a building which provoked a predominantly critical response in Regency England (in political terms the period from 1811 to 1820 when George, Prince of Wales&mdash;future George IV&mdash;ruled in place of his ailing father George III; and in cultural terms up until the death of George IV in 1830).&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;New Brighton Guide</em>&nbsp;called it a&nbsp;&quot;masterpiece of bad taste&quot;&nbsp;while the&nbsp;Comtesse de Boigne declared it a&nbsp;&quot;mad-house.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^3</code>&nbsp;And when Queen Victoria first visited the Royal Pavilion in 1837, she noted,&nbsp;&quot;The Pavilion is a strange, odd, Chinese looking place, both outside and inside. Most of the rooms are low, and I can see a morsel of the sea, from one of my sitting room windows.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^4</code></p>\n"

"<h3>The patron: the Prince Regent</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ostensible aesthetic randomness of the Pavilion is best comprehended as the material expression of the profligate and rebellious life of its extraordinary benefactor, the Prince Regent, the future George IV, undoubtedly the greatest royal patron of the arts since King Charles I. A man of easy wit and charm, as well as political indolence and questionable morals, the Prince was the touchstone of style for the fashion-conscious Georgian elite of the day. He first visited the seaside resort of Brighton in 1783 to benefit from its reputedly medicinal waters. Captivated by the picturesque promise of the area, the Prince purchased a &quot;superior farmhouse&quot;&nbsp;in 1786 and engaged the royal architect Henry Holland to convert this modest building into a Neo-classical &quot;marine pavilion&quot;&nbsp;fit for a royal personage at play. Under the influence of the Prince Regent, William Porden, Nash&rsquo;s assistant, added a large stables and riding school in the Indian-style which would be the decorative prototype for the &quot;Oriental&quot;&nbsp;incarnation of the Royal Pavilion by its&nbsp;principal architect, John Nash.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The architect: John Nash</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>John Nash was the perfect professional partner for the Pavilion&rsquo;s colorful patron. Subsequently criticised for an overly fashionable&nbsp;and reckless approach to architectural practice, and a resultant lack of purity in the finished product, Nash had planned Regent&rsquo;s Street and Regent&rsquo;s Park in London as a celebration of the rise of the new consumer classes.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"John Nash, PLAN, presented to the House of Commons, of a STREET proposed from CHARING CROSS to PORTLAND PLACE, leading to the Crown Estate in Marylebone Park,&quot; 1813.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e3376e78c0e5bf572ed3ef63b1be7953d16c1af5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"> John Nash, PLAN, presented to the House of Commons, of a STREET proposed from CHARING CROSS to PORTLAND PLACE, leading to the Crown Estate in Marylebone Park,&quot; 1813.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nash&rsquo;s vision for Brighton was informed by the Prince&rsquo;s aesthetic sensibilities and colorful personality and the architect&rsquo;s own experiences of the Picturesque (the beauty inherent in unspoilt nature, as first outlined by the artist William Gilpin), as well as the aquatints of &quot;hindoo&quot;&nbsp;architecture which appeared in the six-volume <em>Oriental Scenery</em> by the landscape painters Thomas and William Daniell at the end of the 18th century. The result was the so-called &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style, comprised of an assortment of architectural and design forms and motifs taken from Britain&rsquo;s colonial experience of the &quot;Orient.&quot;<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Eastern&quot;&nbsp;style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Without denying the central agency of both the bold-thinking Nash and fashion-conscious Prince Regent in the design of the Royal Pavilion, the range and variety of architectural styles should be viewed within the context of a&nbsp;wider cultural tradition just then emerging. This exotic mad-house was a response to the early&nbsp;British Empire and its&nbsp;East India Company (a trading company established in 1600 with a&nbsp;fleet of ships and an army&nbsp;200,000 strong)&nbsp;that facillitated the rule of&nbsp;the Indian sub-continent for some two-hundred years and&nbsp;which&nbsp;shaped the British Empire.&nbsp;Here was trade from the East, a rich complex of cultural interchange, and a fascination for the &quot;Orient&quot;&nbsp;in its widest, and loosest, colonial meaning. As the architectural historian Ian Sutton has written, in the nineteenth-century, &quot;Both&nbsp;[architects] and their patrons were assailed by new temptations which they found difficult to resist.&quot;<code class=\"latex\">^5</code></p>\n"

"<p>Both buildings pre-date the Pavilion. Moreover, juxtaposing a culturally alien interior to the exterior was not a new idea, and was in some sense&nbsp;a colonial interpretation of the cultures of the lands of Empire. Henry Holland&#39;s French Neo-classical Carlton House,&nbsp;1783&ndash;96&nbsp;in London, for example, boasted a fine Chinese drawing room. As such, Brighton Pavilion could be seen as the culmination of years of experimentation, rather than a one-off, stand-alone enterprise.<br />\n"

"<h3>The &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Architecturally, the &quot;Indian&quot;&nbsp;exterior owes much to C.P. Cockerell&rsquo;s Sezincote; however, there is in reality a significant difference which speaks of the changing fashions and the further development of exotic eclecticism in this period. Sezincote is hybridic: it retains a Neo-classical facade (the windows and bays), whilst sporting a turquoise onion-shaped Mughul dome and minarets, typical of Islamic architecture of the Indian sub-continent, such as the Taj Mahal, and features a Hindu-inspired garden, including a temple.</p>\n"

"&copy; British Library Board</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Pavilion&#39;s exterior, on the other hand, is more uniformly Mugul-flavored, albeit shot through with a generic sense of the &quot;Orient&quot;: namely&nbsp;the arabesque profusion of ten domes and ten minarets, supported by a cast iron frame, and the vertical thrust of the building, giving it a sense of lightness and airiness, an almost dream-like temporary tent-like quality, in opposition to the permanent horizontal-axised stout square-blockedness of Sezincote.<br />\n"

"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/68aac594703305fd99946e992dd51de0573b92ce.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">John Nash, &quot;Chinese Gallery As It Was [Long Gallery],&quot; Plate XV in <em>Illustrations of Her Majesty&#39;s Palace at Brighton</em>, &nbsp;J.

"\n"
"<h3>The &quot;Chinese&quot;&nbsp;interior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As for the interior of the Pavilion, while England&rsquo;s curiosity for Chinese culture pre-dates that of its interest in Indian civilization by almost a century, the former&rsquo;s application to the inside of Nash&rsquo;s building is complex, for we have in fact the Neo-classical, Chinese and Gothic at work together. The Entrance Hall (see image below), for instance, is symmetrically arranged, as per the Neo-classical; while the Long Gallery (see image above) contains a multitude of generic Chinese/Asian features (&quot;Chinoiserie&quot;), including the hexagonal lanterns, the silk tassels and the motif of bamboo and birds on the wallpaper, the work of interior decorator Frederick Crace.</p>\n"

"<h3>Making sense of a &lsquo;mad-house&rsquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Royal Pavilion at Brighton in all its apparent kaleidoscopic silliness, brashness, vitality, phantasamagoric contradictions and oppositions, references, and tries&mdash;though not always succeeds&mdash;to respond to the tastes of a new fashionable elite at home and to make sense (or not) of a new world of empire abroad. Indeed, in all its range and variety, as well as in its playful eccentricities, it is quite possibly the ultimate architectural manifestation of early nineteenth-century eclecticism, as well as being the material personification of a powerful Regency personality and his private architect. The history of architecture in Britain is all the richer as a result.</p>\n"

"<p>A key idea of the Age of Enlightenment&mdash;that empirical observation grounded in science and reason could best advance society&mdash;is expressed by the faces of the individuals in Joseph Wright of Derby&rsquo;s <em>A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Age of Enlightenment</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wright&rsquo;s painting encapsulates in one moment the Enlightenment, a philosophical shift in the eighteenth century away from traditional religious models of the universe and toward an empirical, scientific approach. It is important to note the term given this new way of thinking. &ldquo;Enlightenment&rdquo; indicates an active process, undertaken by an individual by group.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The age of Enlightenment is most closely associated with scientists and inventors, but writers and artists also played major roles. They helped spread enlightenment concepts via the written word and printed image, and inspired others to think rationally about the world in which they lived. The provincial English painter Joseph Wright of Derby became the unofficial artist of the Enlightenment, depicting scientists and philosophers in ways previously reserved for Biblical heroes and Greek gods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Joseph Wright of Derby</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Joseph Wright of Derby was born in the town of Derby in central England, and save for short stints in Liverpool and London, lived in that city his entire life. He was known even during his lifetime as Joseph Wright of Derby, to distinguish him from another artist of the same name. Even though Wright of Derby was the more talented of the two, he was stuck with the geographical identifier on his name.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other than Thomas Gainsborough, who spent much of his career in the high-society resort town of Bath, Wright was the most prominent English painter of the eighteenth century to spend the majority of his career outside of London. Operating without the constraints of the mainstream London art world, Wright was free to explore a general interest in science with his friends, a group that included Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles) and other members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, an informal learned society which met to discuss scientific topics of the day.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wright was known for his deft depiction of the contrasts between light and dark, also known as chiaroscuro, and his unflinching portrayal of the true personalities of his subjects. This trait caused his downfall when he attempted to work as a portraitist&mdash;few wanted a portrait, warts and all.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Intensity of Scientific Discovery</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 1760s Wright began to explore the traditional boundaries of various genres of painting. According to the French academies of art, the highest genre of painting was history painting, which depicted Biblical or classical subjects to demonstrate a moral lesson. This high regard for history panting was adopted by the British&mdash;Benjamin West&rsquo;s <em>The Death of General Wolfe</em> is a prominent example.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Wright took this noble, aggrandizing method of portraying events and applied it to a composition showing a contemporary subject in <em>A Philosopher Lecturing at the Orrery</em>. Rather than a moral of leadership or heroism, this painting&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral&rdquo; is the pursuit of scientific knowledge. With its collection of non-idealized men, women, boys, and girls informally arranged in a small physical space around a central organizing point, Wright&rsquo;s painting mimics the compositional structure of a conversation piece (an informal group portrait) like Zoffany&#39;s <em>Gore Family</em> (above), but with the dramatic lighting and scale expected from a major religious scene.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In effect, <em>A Philosopher Lecturing at the Orrery </em>does depict a moment of religious epiphany. Much like the central figure in Caravaggio&rsquo;s<em> Calling of Saint Matthew </em>(below), the figures listening to the philosopher&rsquo;s lecture in Wright&rsquo;s painting are experiencing conversion...to science.</p>\n"

Most of these earlier works were Christian subjects, and the light sources were often simple candles. Wright flips the script with his scientific subject matter. The gas lamp which acts as the sun pulls double duty in the painting. It illuminates the scene, allowing the viewer to clearly see the figures within, and it symbolizes the active enlightenment in which those figures are participating.</span></p>\n"

But why would an artist depict meat at all, let alone in such an unsavory way and in combination with a religious scene?&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The way of the flesh and the way of the spirit</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Dutch painter Pieter Aertsen, who worked for many years in Antwerp, was later renowned for his life-size market scenes with exuberant still life elements. Many scholars have commented on the bold originality of Aertsen&rsquo;s compositions, and rightly so. In the sixteenth century, religious or mythological scenes usually occupied pride of place in works of art, while everyday objects were considered mere accessories. In this and other&nbsp;roughly contemporary works like <em>Christ in the House of Mary and Martha</em>&nbsp;(below), Aertsen has deliberately reversed this formula. He gave all the attention to the accessories, which seem to spill out of the picture and into the viewer&rsquo;s own space.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Christ with Mary and Martha, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ccc4b4ff34ac21f9c91e6a330370a3d1f5382ac0.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>Christ in the House of&nbsp;Mary and Martha</em>, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen certainly seems to have been the first to foreground meat in a prestigious, costly oil painting on a monumental size. However, he may also have been inspired to upend traditional hierarchies of subject matter (giving most of the attention to the still-life elements) by the painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden&#39;s <em>Ecce homo </em>scene<em>&nbsp;</em>(<em>Ecce homo</em>&nbsp;means &quot;behold the man&quot; and refers to&nbsp;Pontius Pilate presenting&nbsp;the beaten Christ crowned with&nbsp;thorns before his crucifixion). Leyden, in <em>Christ Presented the People</em> (below),&nbsp;shows a great market square with a crowd in the foreground, while Christ himself has been relegated to the background.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Lucas van Leyden, Christ Presented to the People, c. 1510, copperplate engraving, 28.8 x 45.2 cm (The British Museum)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7642ddf09bd1a450b93c9edebf0e569e11ee9cd8.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Lucas van Leyden, <em>Christ Presented to the People,</em> c. 1510, copperplate engraving, 28.8 x 45.2 cm (The British Museum)</span></span><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Crossed herring (detail), Pieter Aertsen, A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b352bceece09f8bfc4234e556d9bc96717e3f106.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Crossed herring (detail), Pieter Aertsen, <em>A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms</em>, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)</span></span>This&nbsp;may be a comment on the arduous nature of spirituality: those who truly seek enlightenment must look hard, and turn their attention away from the things of this world. And indeed, in Aertsen&rsquo;s picture, the crossed herring on a pewter plate just above the ox&rsquo;s head&mdash;fish was associated with Lent, a period when the faithful abstained from meat&mdash;seem to point in the direction of the holy scene in the background, beyond the meat.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other scholars have suggested that Aertsen&rsquo;s inversion of traditional hierarchies was inspired by sources from classical antiquity&mdash;though perhaps equally moralizing. The Roman satirist Juvenal, for example, chastised the lovers of lavish meals in his eleventh satire, lambasting their fondness for &ldquo;stinking meat shops&rdquo; instead of plain, wholesome food. Closer to Aertsen&rsquo;s own time, the philosopher Desiderius Erasmus&nbsp;used irony to make a point: undesirable behavior is heaped with praise&nbsp;to throw its negative aspects into sharp relief, while the reader is treated to a good laugh. Erasmus does this to great effect in <em>In Praise of Folly </em>(1511), a book that Aertsen and his contemporaries may very well have read.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The art of rendering well</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Market Woman with Vegetable Stall, 1567, oil on wood (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/649343f96e60dd9c50082933c54d82dbec68fb5f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, Market <em>Woman with Vegetable Stall</em>, 1567, oil on wood (Gem&auml;ldegalerie, Berlin)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen&rsquo;s bold move can also be seen in light of his artistic context. Antwerp in the mid-sixteenth century was one of the greatest centers of mercantile trade at the time: populous, prosperous, and booming.&nbsp;It was the second largest city in northern Europe&mdash;smaller than Paris but bigger than London&mdash;and arguably also the wealthiest. Merchants came from <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Jan Brueghel the Elder, Flowers in a Wooden Vessel, 1568, oil on wood, 98 x 73 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb2a49dd484a23c0a9a95993eea605e50e079233.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Jan Brueghel the Elder, <em>Flowers in a Wooden Vessel</em>, 1568, oil on wood, 98 x 73 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span>around the world to deal in spices, staple goods, finance, and especially luxury goods like glass, fine textiles, precious furnishings, and works of art. The number of artists attracted to this concentration of wealth was considerable, and this in turn encouraged specialization, a situation that may also have encouraged Aertsen to flaunt his skill in painting lifelike elements such as fruit, vegetables, cheese, and meat in the market scenes for which he is now famous (see the image above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like so many other specialties we take for granted today: landscapes, flower pieces, scenes from everyday life, etc. market scenes were just beginning to emerge as subjects in their own right, independent of paintings that depicted mythological or religious scenes&mdash;which, by the way, Aertsen also painted in considerable numbers (see below), though not all of them survived the waves of iconoclasm (the destruction of images) that swept across northern Europe in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, The Adoration of the Magi, c. 1560, oil on panel, 167.5 x 180 cm (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bf25ca6e7e653517b09194e1e1de3df6f4a5256c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>The Adoration of the Magi</em>, c. 1560, oil on panel, 167.5 x 180 cm (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)</span></span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>But for those familiar with Antwerp&rsquo;s tangled local politics, there are some highly specific messages embedded in this composition that would have been legible only to them.

"<p>The Butchers&rsquo; Guild in Antwerp was a very powerful institution that enjoyed the support of Emperor Charles V himself.

Anyone who wanted to buy meat in Antwerp had to buy it from the <em>Vleeshuis</em>, or &ldquo;Meat Hall,&rdquo; an imposing building near the banks of the River Scheldt that was rivaled as a landmark only by the Church of Our Lady (now the cathedral of Antwerp), truly a sign of the guild&rsquo;s power. Nevertheless, the butchers&rsquo; influence was coming under increasing attack in 1551: butchers from outside the city had banded together to fight what they perceived as an unfair trade monopoly.

But why would an artist depict meat at all, let alone in such an unsavory way and in combination with a religious scene?&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The way of the flesh and the way of the spirit</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Dutch painter Pieter Aertsen, who worked for many years in Antwerp, was later renowned for his life-size market scenes with exuberant still life elements. Many scholars have commented on the bold originality of Aertsen&rsquo;s compositions, and rightly so. In the sixteenth century, religious or mythological scenes usually occupied pride of place in works of art, while everyday objects were considered mere accessories. In this and other&nbsp;roughly contemporary works like <em>Christ in the House of Mary and Martha</em>&nbsp;(below), Aertsen has deliberately reversed this formula. He gave all the attention to the accessories, which seem to spill out of the picture and into the viewer&rsquo;s own space.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Christ with Mary and Martha, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ccc4b4ff34ac21f9c91e6a330370a3d1f5382ac0.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>Christ in the House of&nbsp;Mary and Martha</em>, 1552, 101.5 x 60 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen certainly seems to have been the first to foreground meat in a prestigious, costly oil painting on a monumental size. However, he may also have been inspired to upend traditional hierarchies of subject matter (giving most of the attention to the still-life elements) by the painter and printmaker Lucas van Leyden&#39;s <em>Ecce homo </em>scene<em>&nbsp;</em>(<em>Ecce homo</em>&nbsp;means &quot;behold the man&quot; and refers to&nbsp;Pontius Pilate presenting&nbsp;the beaten Christ crowned with&nbsp;thorns before his crucifixion). Leyden, in <em>Christ Presented the People</em> (below),&nbsp;shows a great market square with a crowd in the foreground, while Christ himself has been relegated to the background.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Lucas van Leyden, Christ Presented to the People, c. 1510, copperplate engraving, 28.8 x 45.2 cm (The British Museum)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7642ddf09bd1a450b93c9edebf0e569e11ee9cd8.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Lucas van Leyden, <em>Christ Presented to the People,</em> c. 1510, copperplate engraving, 28.8 x 45.2 cm (The British Museum)</span></span><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Crossed herring (detail), Pieter Aertsen, A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b352bceece09f8bfc4234e556d9bc96717e3f106.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Crossed herring (detail), Pieter Aertsen, <em>A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms</em>, 1551, oil on panel 45 1/2 x 66 1/2 inches / 115.6 x 168.9 cm (North Carolina Museum of Art)</span></span>This&nbsp;may be a comment on the arduous nature of spirituality: those who truly seek enlightenment must look hard, and turn their attention away from the things of this world. And indeed, in Aertsen&rsquo;s picture, the crossed herring on a pewter plate just above the ox&rsquo;s head&mdash;fish was associated with Lent, a period when the faithful abstained from meat&mdash;seem to point in the direction of the holy scene in the background, beyond the meat.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other scholars have suggested that Aertsen&rsquo;s inversion of traditional hierarchies was inspired by sources from classical antiquity&mdash;though perhaps equally moralizing. The Roman satirist Juvenal, for example, chastised the lovers of lavish meals in his eleventh satire, lambasting their fondness for &ldquo;stinking meat shops&rdquo; instead of plain, wholesome food. Closer to Aertsen&rsquo;s own time, the philosopher Desiderius Erasmus&nbsp;used irony to make a point: undesirable behavior is heaped with praise&nbsp;to throw its negative aspects into sharp relief, while the reader is treated to a good laugh. Erasmus does this to great effect in <em>In Praise of Folly </em>(1511), a book that Aertsen and his contemporaries may very well have read.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The art of rendering well</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, Market Woman with Vegetable Stall, 1567, oil on wood (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/649343f96e60dd9c50082933c54d82dbec68fb5f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, Market <em>Woman with Vegetable Stall</em>, 1567, oil on wood (Gem&auml;ldegalerie, Berlin)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Aertsen&rsquo;s bold move can also be seen in light of his artistic context. Antwerp in the mid-sixteenth century was one of the greatest centers of mercantile trade at the time: populous, prosperous, and booming.&nbsp;It was the second largest city in northern Europe&mdash;smaller than Paris but bigger than London&mdash;and arguably also the wealthiest. Merchants came from <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Jan Brueghel the Elder, Flowers in a Wooden Vessel, 1568, oil on wood, 98 x 73 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb2a49dd484a23c0a9a95993eea605e50e079233.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Jan Brueghel the Elder, <em>Flowers in a Wooden Vessel</em>, 1568, oil on wood, 98 x 73 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)</span></span>around the world to deal in spices, staple goods, finance, and especially luxury goods like glass, fine textiles, precious furnishings, and works of art. The number of artists attracted to this concentration of wealth was considerable, and this in turn encouraged specialization, a situation that may also have encouraged Aertsen to flaunt his skill in painting lifelike elements such as fruit, vegetables, cheese, and meat in the market scenes for which he is now famous (see the image above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like so many other specialties we take for granted today: landscapes, flower pieces, scenes from everyday life, etc. market scenes were just beginning to emerge as subjects in their own right, independent of paintings that depicted mythological or religious scenes&mdash;which, by the way, Aertsen also painted in considerable numbers (see below), though not all of them survived the waves of iconoclasm (the destruction of images) that swept across northern Europe in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Pieter Aertsen, The Adoration of the Magi, c. 1560, oil on panel, 167.5 x 180 cm (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bf25ca6e7e653517b09194e1e1de3df6f4a5256c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Pieter Aertsen, <em>The Adoration of the Magi</em>, c. 1560, oil on panel, 167.5 x 180 cm (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)</span></span></p>\n"

"<p>But for those familiar with Antwerp&rsquo;s tangled local politics, there are some highly specific messages embedded in this composition that would have been legible only to them.

"<p>However, this match is about politics as well as love. Behind Henry stands the personification of France, wearing a blue silk garment embroidered with gold fleur-de-lys (the coat of arms of the French monarchy) and an elaborate plumed helmet encircled by a gold crown. She gently touches Henry&rsquo;s shoulder and whispers in his ear, assuring him that a match with the Medici princess is indeed good for the kingdom. France urges Henry to turn away from the field of battle, the aftermath of which is visible in the burning town in the background, and attend to hearth and home, for domestic matters are no less important to the survival of the monarchy than military exploits. Henry obliges; his helmet and shield&mdash;now the playthings of two tender cherubs&mdash;lie at his feet. &nbsp;</p>\n"

In both scale and subject matter, this cycle is unprecedented. Not only is it unique in its dedication to the major life events of a queen, but it also includes events that were both quite recent and quite humiliating. After Henry was assassinated in 1610, Marie&mdash;acting as regent for their young son, Louis XIII&mdash;ruled the kingdom of France for seven years. The position suited her; but many French nobles begrudged her power. Divisions in the court, including tensions with her own son, led to Marie&rsquo;s exile from the Paris in 1617. The commission of the biographical cycle marked her reconciliation with Louis and her return to the capital city in 1620. It vindicated her reign as the queen of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"

This, at least, is the message she wished to convey and she worked closely with her advisors and Rubens to ensure her story was told as she saw fit. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <em>Presentation of the Portrait</em> forms part of this agenda; it is an idealized portrayal of the conclusion in April of 1600 of marriage negotiations that were two years in the making. The painting presents Henry&rsquo;s bethrothal to Marie de Medici as a union ordained by the gods, counseled by France, and inspired by Marie&rsquo;s beauty and virtues. In reality, the merits of the union were extolled not by a soft-haired, fleshy Cupid but by the alliance&rsquo;s French and Italian proponents, one of whom reported that the portrait presented by the Florentine negotiators &ldquo;pleased His Majesty exceedingly.&rdquo; Henry, for his part, was distracted from the negotiations by his new mistress, whom he had promised to marry. Nevertheless, he recognized the political and financial necessity of the Medici marriage. When his advisor announced the finalization of the marriage contract, Henry exclaimed: &quot;By God, let it be; there is nothing to be done about it, because for the good of my kingdom and my peoples, you say that I must be married, so I simply must be.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Cupid and King Henry discussing the portrait of Marie de Medici (detail), Peter Paul Rubens, The Presentation of the Portrait of Marie de’ Medici, c. 1622-1625, oil on canvas, 394 x 295 cm (Musée du Louvre)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13309b24d7b87bf2b9c8b32cf7be57d65a03e1c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Cupid and King Henry discussing the portrait of Marie de Medici (detail), Peter Paul Rubens,<em> The Presentation of the Portrait of Marie de&rsquo; Medici</em>, c. 1622-1625, oil on canvas, 394 x 295 cm (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre)</span></span>For Henry, a Protestant who had converted to Catholicism upon ascending to the throne in 1593, a Catholic wife would assuage any concerns about his loyalty to the Catholic Church in France. Additionally, Marie&rsquo;s hefty dowry eased Henry&rsquo;s large debt to the Medici, major financial backers of his military activities. And, perhaps most importantly, Henry was nearing the age of 50 and had yet to father an heir, putting France&rsquo;s future stability in danger. A fruitful union with Marie was key to this stability. In this matter, the 27-year old Marie did not disappoint, giving birth to a son one year after the wedding, and five additional children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Rubens asserts Marie&rsquo;s successful role as wife and mother by establishing a dominant vertical axis through the center of the composition from Juno, with her exposed, full breasts, through Marie&rsquo;s portrait to the chubby cherub directly below. Of all of the figures in the painting, Marie and the cherub are the only ones who look out at the viewer, pointedly reaffirming the centrality of Marie de&rsquo; Medici and of her royal progeny to the future of France. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The theme of peace, which runs throughout the cycle, was indeed furthered not only in France but in Europe by the marriage alliances brokered by Marie for her children: Louis XIII married a daughter of the Spanish king, her daughter Elisabeth married the heir to the Spanish throne (the future King Philip IV), and her daughter Henrietta married Charles I of England.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Marie&rsquo;s truce with her son Louis however was short lived and she died in exile in 1631. Despite the challenges of her life as she struggled to regain the power and influence she once had, Marie de&rsquo; Medici lived to hear herself proclaimed mother of three sovereigns, certainly an impressive legacy for the orphaned daughter of the Grandduke of Tuscany. &nbsp;</p>\n"

The message is clear: even the king of the gods can be subdued by love. Following Jupiter&rsquo;s lead, Henry must also turn his attention to marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>However, this match is about politics as well as love. Behind Henry stands the personification of France, wearing a blue silk garment embroidered with gold fleur-de-lys (the coat of arms of the French monarchy) and an elaborate plumed helmet encircled by a gold crown. She gently touches Henry&rsquo;s shoulder and whispers in his ear, assuring him that a match with the Medici princess is indeed good for the kingdom. France urges Henry to turn away from the field of battle, the aftermath of which is visible in the burning town in the background, and attend to hearth and home, for domestic matters are no less important to the survival of the monarchy than military exploits. Henry obliges; his helmet and shield&mdash;now the playthings of two tender cherubs&mdash;lie at his feet. &nbsp;</p>\n"

In both scale and subject matter, this cycle is unprecedented. Not only is it unique in its dedication to the major life events of a queen, but it also includes events that were both quite recent and quite humiliating. After Henry was assassinated in 1610, Marie&mdash;acting as regent for their young son, Louis XIII&mdash;ruled the kingdom of France for seven years. The position suited her; but many French nobles begrudged her power. Divisions in the court, including tensions with her own son, led to Marie&rsquo;s exile from the Paris in 1617. The commission of the biographical cycle marked her reconciliation with Louis and her return to the capital city in 1620. It vindicated her reign as the queen of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"

This, at least, is the message she wished to convey and she worked closely with her advisors and Rubens to ensure her story was told as she saw fit. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The <em>Presentation of the Portrait</em> forms part of this agenda; it is an idealized portrayal of the conclusion in April of 1600 of marriage negotiations that were two years in the making. The painting presents Henry&rsquo;s bethrothal to Marie de Medici as a union ordained by the gods, counseled by France, and inspired by Marie&rsquo;s beauty and virtues. In reality, the merits of the union were extolled not by a soft-haired, fleshy Cupid but by the alliance&rsquo;s French and Italian proponents, one of whom reported that the portrait presented by the Florentine negotiators &ldquo;pleased His Majesty exceedingly.&rdquo; Henry, for his part, was distracted from the negotiations by his new mistress, whom he had promised to marry. Nevertheless, he recognized the political and financial necessity of the Medici marriage. When his advisor announced the finalization of the marriage contract, Henry exclaimed: &quot;By God, let it be; there is nothing to be done about it, because for the good of my kingdom and my peoples, you say that I must be married, so I simply must be.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n"

Additionally, Marie&rsquo;s hefty dowry eased Henry&rsquo;s large debt to the Medici, major financial backers of his military activities. And, perhaps most importantly, Henry was nearing the age of 50 and had yet to father an heir, putting France&rsquo;s future stability in danger. A fruitful union with Marie was key to this stability. In this matter, the 27-year old Marie did not disappoint, giving birth to a son one year after the wedding, and five additional children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Rubens asserts Marie&rsquo;s successful role as wife and mother by establishing a dominant vertical axis through the center of the composition from Juno, with her exposed, full breasts, through Marie&rsquo;s portrait to the chubby cherub directly below. Of all of the figures in the painting, Marie and the cherub are the only ones who look out at the viewer, pointedly reaffirming the centrality of Marie de&rsquo; Medici and of her royal progeny to the future of France. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The theme of peace, which runs throughout the cycle, was indeed furthered not only in France but in Europe by the marriage alliances brokered by Marie for her children: Louis XIII married a daughter of the Spanish king, her daughter Elisabeth married the heir to the Spanish throne (the future King Philip IV), and her daughter Henrietta married Charles I of England.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Despite the challenges of her life as she struggled to regain the power and influence she once had, Marie de&rsquo; Medici lived to hear herself proclaimed mother of three sovereigns, certainly an impressive legacy for the orphaned daughter of the Grandduke of Tuscany. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The Roman triumph</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Roman triumph was an ancient martial tradition&mdash;a parade so riotous that its symbolic culmination involved catapulting the victorious general (<em>triumphator</em>) to quasi-divine status for a single, heady day. The Romans&nbsp;marked his status by staining his face red using the mineral pigment cinnabar (Jupiter&#39;s&nbsp;countenance was said to have the same ruddy hue). &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Romans traced the traditions of the triumph back to their own beginnings. Rome&rsquo;s legendary founder, Romulus, was the first to celebrate the rite when he defeated and killed Acron, the king of Caenina.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Victory in Judea</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the summer of 71 C.E. the Roman emperor Vespasian and Titus, his eldest son, had quelled a dangerous revolt in the Roman province of Judea<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and returned to Rome to celebrate this major accomplishment.&nbsp;Not only that, but the Flavian dynasty&nbsp;(Vespasian and his two sons Titus and Domitian)&nbsp;had succeeded in winning the throne during the year 69 C.E.&mdash;a time of bloody civil turmoil known as the &ldquo;Year of the Four Emperors.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>A great deal was at stake for Vespasian and Titus, both relative political newcomers from a family line (Flavius)&nbsp;that was not particularly illustrious. The honor of the triumph was accorded to them jointly, and the spectacle (as described by Flavius Josephus in his text known as <em>The Jewish War</em>)<em>&nbsp;</em>rivaled anything that Rome had ever seen before: spoils, prisoners, pictorial narratives in abundance. All this was meant to awe the spectators and to transport the viewers to the battlefields of the war in the east. But the ritual of the triumph, its parade&mdash;even the semi-divine status accorded the <em>triumphator</em>&mdash;was ephemeral. For this reason, the later construction of permanent monuments (like the Arch of Titus)&nbsp;served to make an impact on the urban landscape (and the collective memory of city dwellers) that lasted far longer than the events of the day itself.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The tradition of&nbsp;triumphal monuments connects the Flavians to the traditions of the Roman Republic. Early monuments included columns&mdash;for instance the rostrate column (<em>columna rostrata) </em>of Caius Duilius (c. 260 B.C.E.)&mdash;and the early triumphal arch prototype known as the fornix Fabianus erected in the Forum Romanum by Q. Fabius Allobrogicus in 121 B.C.E. The emperor Augustus continued the use of the triumphal arch, even though he restructured the institution of the triumph itself. Since the Flavians were relative newcomers to the Roman power structure, they needed as much legitimization as they could find, and thus participating in the time-honored traditions of the triumph and its stock monuments made a good deal of sense.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Arch of Titus is located in Summa Sacra Via, the highest point of the Sacra Via, Rome&#39;s &quot;Sacred Way&quot; that served as its main processional street. Furthemore, the Arch of Titus&nbsp;&nbsp; commands a key point along the triumphal route (<em>via Triumphalis</em>)&mdash;one that visually&nbsp;links the valley of the Flavian amphitheater (known to us as the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/early-empire/v/colosseum-amphitheatrum-flavium-c-70-80-c-e-rome\">Colosseum</a>) to the valley of the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/beginners-guide-rome/a/forum-romanum-the-roman-forum\">Forum Romanum</a> and the Capitoline Hill beyond. Many triumphal parades had passed along this route for many centuries, thus the choice to place a permanent triumphal monument astride the route was not accidental but, rather, deliberately evocative of the fact that the triumph as a ritual both created and reinforced collective memory for&nbsp;Romans. This arch, built as an honorific monument, honored Titus posthumously and was a project executed by his younger brother and imperial successor, Domitian (emperor,&nbsp;81-96 C.E.). Another arch dedicated to Titus, triumphal in its nature, was located in the valley of the Circus Maximus&mdash;but this arch only survives in the form of scattered sculptural fragments and a Medieval transcription of its dedicatory inscription.&nbsp;Recent archaeological excavations (2015) in the Circus Maximus have revealed previously unknown remains of this &quot;lost&quot; arch, including elements of its foundations.</p>\n"

"<h3>The attic inscription</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Attic inscription, Arch of Titus, after 81 C.E., Rome (photo: Dr. Steven Fine, used by permission)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/11d451d68c17a53d77b32d5f381725b723a52f5e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Attic inscription, Arch of Titus, after 81 C.E., Rome (photo: Dr. Steven Fine, used by permission)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The surviving ancient attic inscription (above) records the dedication of the monument to Titus. Given that Titus is identified as having been deified (<em>divus</em>), we learn that the monument&rsquo;s completion can only have occurred after Titus&rsquo; death in September of 81 C.E.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text of the attic inscription reads:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>SENATVS<br />\n"
"POPVLVSQVE&middot;ROMANVS<br />\n"
"DIVO&middot;TITO&middot;DIVI&middot;VESPASIANI&middot;F(ILIO)<br />\n"
"VESPASIANO&middot;AVGVSTO (CIL 6.945)</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>The Senate and the Roman people (dedicate this) to the deified Titus Vespasian Augustus, son of the deified Vespasian</em></p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The inscription makes the dedication a public one&mdash;undertaken on the part of the Senate and the Roman People (<em>Senatus Populusque Romanus</em>), and reminds viewers of Titus&rsquo; link to his likewise deified father, Vespasian, who had died in 79 C.E. This dedication is an example of shrewd power politics on the part of the Emperor&nbsp;Domitian&mdash;he had been too young to take part in the military glory enjoyed by his father and brother. Perhaps he sought to bask in the&nbsp;generally favorable public opinion they enjoyed&nbsp;as he himself made the transition to power.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Two panel reliefs flank the single passageway of the arch, and a third adorns the vault (the vault relief is above). The subject matter of the flanking reliefs draws upon the 71 C.E. triumph of Vespasian and Titus, depicting key triumphal episodes following the fall of Jerusalem. In one scene (below)&nbsp;&nbsp;Romans carry spoils from the Temple in Jerusalem, including a Menorah, sacred trumpets and the showbread table. Recent studies have shown these items were painted with yellow ochre.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Since the triumphal parade would have passed through the very spot on which the arch was constructed, these images serve as powerful evocations of collective memories shared and held by the Roman people. The depiction in the reliefs echoes the riotous parade described by Flavius Josephus. The program of Flavian architecture largely transformed the physical landscape of Rome; this program was replete with visual cues and reminders of Flavian success, all of which stemmed from and centered around the great triumph at the culmination of the Jewish War.</p>\n"

"<p>During the eleventh century the arch was incorporated into a fortress built by the Frangipani family in Rome, resulting in damage to the panel reliefs that is still visible today. In 1821, during the pontificate of Pope Pius VII, Giuseppe Valadier undertook a major restoration of the surviving structure. In order to identify those portions that had been restored, Valadier employed travertine as opposed to the original marble. The western side of the attic received a new inscription at the time of this restoration. Canaletto&rsquo;s famous painting of the arch grants a view of the monument&rsquo;s condition prior to Valadier&rsquo;s restoration.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Roman triumph</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Roman triumph was an ancient martial tradition&mdash;a parade so riotous that its symbolic culmination involved catapulting the victorious general (<em>triumphator</em>) to quasi-divine status for a single, heady day. The Romans&nbsp;marked his status by staining his face red using the mineral pigment cinnabar (Jupiter&#39;s&nbsp;countenance was said to have the same ruddy hue). &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Romans traced the traditions of the triumph back to their own beginnings. Rome&rsquo;s legendary founder, Romulus, was the first to celebrate the rite when he defeated and killed Acron, the king of Caenina.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Victory in Judea</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the summer of 71 C.E. the Roman emperor Vespasian and Titus, his eldest son, had quelled a dangerous revolt in the Roman province of Judea<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and returned to Rome to celebrate this major accomplishment.&nbsp;Not only that, but the Flavian dynasty&nbsp;(Vespasian and his two sons Titus and Domitian)&nbsp;had succeeded in winning the throne during the year 69 C.E.&mdash;a time of bloody civil turmoil known as the &ldquo;Year of the Four Emperors.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>A great deal was at stake for Vespasian and Titus, both relative political newcomers from a family line (Flavius)&nbsp;that was not particularly illustrious. The honor of the triumph was accorded to them jointly, and the spectacle (as described by Flavius Josephus in his text known as <em>The Jewish War</em>)<em>&nbsp;</em>rivaled anything that Rome had ever seen before: spoils, prisoners, pictorial narratives in abundance. All this was meant to awe the spectators and to transport the viewers to the battlefields of the war in the east. But the ritual of the triumph, its parade&mdash;even the semi-divine status accorded the <em>triumphator</em>&mdash;was ephemeral. For this reason, the later construction of permanent monuments (like the Arch of Titus)&nbsp;served to make an impact on the urban landscape (and the collective memory of city dwellers) that lasted far longer than the events of the day itself.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The tradition of&nbsp;triumphal monuments connects the Flavians to the traditions of the Roman Republic. Early monuments included columns&mdash;for instance the rostrate column (<em>columna rostrata) </em>of Caius Duilius (c. 260 B.C.E.)&mdash;and the early triumphal arch prototype known as the fornix Fabianus erected in the Forum Romanum by Q. Fabius Allobrogicus in 121 B.C.E. The emperor Augustus continued the use of the triumphal arch, even though he restructured the institution of the triumph itself. Since the Flavians were relative newcomers to the Roman power structure, they needed as much legitimization as they could find, and thus participating in the time-honored traditions of the triumph and its stock monuments made a good deal of sense.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"View across the Roman Forum (Forum Romanum) to the Arch of Titus (photo: Steven Zucker, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6a8e37c1f62b8c14451625d9d87a9f2c014fb17c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">View across the Roman Forum (Forum Romanum) to the Arch of Titus (photo: Steven Zucker, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Arch of Titus is located in Summa Sacra Via, the highest point of the Sacra Via, Rome&#39;s &quot;Sacred Way&quot; that served as its main processional street. Furthemore, the Arch of Titus&nbsp;&nbsp; commands a key point along the triumphal route (<em>via Triumphalis</em>)&mdash;one that visually&nbsp;links the valley of the Flavian amphitheater (known to us as the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/early-empire/v/colosseum-amphitheatrum-flavium-c-70-80-c-e-rome\">Colosseum</a>) to the valley of the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/beginners-guide-rome/a/forum-romanum-the-roman-forum\">Forum Romanum</a> and the Capitoline Hill beyond. Many triumphal parades had passed along this route for many centuries, thus the choice to place a permanent triumphal monument astride the route was not accidental but, rather, deliberately evocative of the fact that the triumph as a ritual both created and reinforced collective memory for&nbsp;Romans. This arch, built as an honorific monument, honored Titus posthumously and was a project executed by his younger brother and imperial successor, Domitian (emperor,&nbsp;81-96 C.E.). Another arch dedicated to Titus, triumphal in its nature, was located in the valley of the Circus Maximus&mdash;but this arch only survives in the form of scattered sculptural fragments and a Medieval transcription of its dedicatory inscription.&nbsp;Recent archaeological excavations (2015) in the Circus Maximus have revealed previously unknown remains of this &quot;lost&quot; arch, including elements of its foundations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The attic inscription</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Attic inscription, Arch of Titus, after 81 C.E., Rome (photo: Dr. Steven Fine, used by permission)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/11d451d68c17a53d77b32d5f381725b723a52f5e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Attic inscription, Arch of Titus, after 81 C.E., Rome (photo: Dr. Steven Fine, used by permission)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The surviving ancient attic inscription (above) records the dedication of the monument to Titus. Given that Titus is identified as having been deified (<em>divus</em>), we learn that the monument&rsquo;s completion can only have occurred after Titus&rsquo; death in September of 81 C.E.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text of the attic inscription reads:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>SENATVS<br />\n"
"POPVLVSQVE&middot;ROMANVS<br />\n"
"DIVO&middot;TITO&middot;DIVI&middot;VESPASIANI&middot;F(ILIO)<br />\n"
"VESPASIANO&middot;AVGVSTO (CIL 6.945)</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>The Senate and the Roman people (dedicate this) to the deified Titus Vespasian Augustus, son of the deified Vespasian</em></p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The inscription makes the dedication a public one&mdash;undertaken on the part of the Senate and the Roman People (<em>Senatus Populusque Romanus</em>), and reminds viewers of Titus&rsquo; link to his likewise deified father, Vespasian, who had died in 79 C.E. This dedication is an example of shrewd power politics on the part of the Emperor&nbsp;Domitian&mdash;he had been too young to take part in the military glory enjoyed by his father and brother. Perhaps he sought to bask in the&nbsp;generally favorable public opinion they enjoyed&nbsp;as he himself made the transition to power.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Relief sculpture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"View of the vault of the arch’s passageway, with a relief of the apotheosis of Titus \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8fed944e71ed588408fdca13c0e40a998d5641d1.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">View of the vault of the arch&rsquo;s passageway, with a relief of the apotheosis of Titus (photo: Dr. Steven Fine, used by permission)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two panel reliefs flank the single passageway of the arch, and a third adorns the vault (the vault relief is above). The subject matter of the flanking reliefs draws upon the 71 C.E. triumph of Vespasian and Titus, depicting key triumphal episodes following the fall of Jerusalem. In one scene (below)&nbsp;&nbsp;Romans carry spoils from the Temple in Jerusalem, including a Menorah, sacred trumpets and the showbread table. Recent studies have shown these items were painted with yellow ochre.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The triumph panel opposite depicts Titus in a triumphal four-horse chariot (<em>quadriga</em>) followed closely by the goddess of Victory (<em>Victoria</em>), preceded by official attendants known as lictors, and accompanied by symbolic representations (<em>genii</em>) of the Senate, the Roman people, and Virtus (manly virtue) (below).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Since the triumphal parade would have passed through the very spot on which the arch was constructed, these images serve as powerful evocations of collective memories shared and held by the Roman people. The depiction in the reliefs echoes the riotous parade described by Flavius Josephus. The program of Flavian architecture largely transformed the physical landscape of Rome; this program was replete with visual cues and reminders of Flavian success, all of which stemmed from and centered around the great triumph at the culmination of the Jewish War.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>During the eleventh century the arch was incorporated into a fortress built by the Frangipani family in Rome, resulting in damage to the panel reliefs that is still visible today. In 1821, during the pontificate of Pope Pius VII, Giuseppe Valadier undertook a major restoration of the surviving structure. In order to identify those portions that had been restored, Valadier employed travertine as opposed to the original marble. The western side of the attic received a new inscription at the time of this restoration. Canaletto&rsquo;s famous painting of the arch grants a view of the monument&rsquo;s condition prior to Valadier&rsquo;s restoration.</p>\n"

"<p>The Arch of Titus has long provided a source of artistic inspiration. Leon Battista Alberti was inspired by its form as he designed the facade of the basilica of Sant&rsquo;Andrea in Mantua, Italy, after 1472. The Arch of Titus has inspired many modern commemorative arches, notably the Arc de Triomphe in Paris (1806), Stanford White&rsquo;s Arch in Washington Square Park in New York City (1892), the United States National Memorial Arch in Valley Forge National Historical Park designed by Paul Philippe Cret (1917), and Edward Lutyens&rsquo; India Gate in New Delhi (1921).</p>\n"

However, following the Spanish Conquest (c. 1534) they quickly appropriated European painting conventions. For example, the images of Sapa Inkas (the sovereign Inka emperors) in Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala&rsquo;s famed illustrated chronicle <em>El primer nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</em> (<em>The First New Chronicle and Good Government</em>, c. 1615) are among the earliest examples of European-style portraiture executed by an indigenous artist.&nbsp;</p>\n"

He is, though,&nbsp;included in the Brooklyn series&mdash;with an inscription that reads &ldquo;bastard tyrant Atahualpa.&rdquo; The increased scale of his figure in the roundel deviates from the conventions of the other thirteen portraits, such as those of Huayna Capac or Huascar.*</p>\n"

"<p>Atahualpa was the last Sapa Inka before the Spanish Conquest began around 1534. As the inscription on the Brooklyn portrait makes explicit, he was the illegitimate son of Sapa Inka Huayna Capac who&nbsp;died of smallpox in 1528.&nbsp;Although Atahualpa ultimately prevailed in&nbsp;a battle with his elder brother Huascar (born of a different mother) for control of the Inka empire&mdash;the timing of the victory was unfortunate. &nbsp;While the civil war raged, the Spanish conquistador Franciso Pizarro, who had landed in present-day Ecuador on his third expedition to the Americas, made his way southward along the western coast of the continent, pillaging and murdering as he traveled. In November of 1523, Atahualpa was celebrating his victory in the city of Cajamarca awaiting the arrival of his prisoner, his brother&nbsp;Huascar. &nbsp;He had learned of Pizarro&rsquo;s expedition party but believed a retinue of less than two hundred men posed little threat. On November 16 Atahualpa, sumptuously attired, rode into the plaza of Cajamarca atop a luxurious litter (a platform for passengers&nbsp;carried by people)&nbsp;accompanied by high ranking Inka nobles and several thousand guards. &nbsp;He was met by the Dominican friar Vicente de Valverde and an interpreter. &nbsp;After a tense exchange in which Atahualpa threw to the ground a book of Catholic prayers offered to him by Valverde, the friar called out to the Spaniards who had hidden themselves, their mounts and artillery in the buildings surrounding the plaza. Pizarro signaled his men to charge, and in the ambush that followed several thousand Andeans were massacred and Atahualpa was taken prisoner. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In captivity, Atahualpa quickly discovered the Spaniards&rsquo; lust for silver and gold. He offered Pizarro an impressive ransom in exchange for his freedom, promising to fill a room approximately 6.2m x 4.8m to half its height (2.5 meters) with gold objects and the same room twice over with silver objects. For the next eight months, gold and silver streamed into Cajamarca from across the empire. Beginning in June the Spaniards began melting down the cache of treasure and divvying up the spoils. After the ransom had been melted and dispersed&mdash;and in response to mounting pressure among the expedition party&mdash;Pizarro had Atahualpa executed on July 26, 1533, by garroting (a method of execution by which a tightened metal collar results in strangulation). &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Who owned this series?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the colonial period if you visited the home of a powerful <em>cacique</em> (an Indian chieftain or nobleman) you might see royal portraits depicting the succession of Inka kings displayed. Portraits of royal Inka&nbsp;genealogies were especially important in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries&mdash;these aristocratic genealogies were employed by the Inka elite to assert their privileged social status and claim political power in the viceroyalty. &nbsp;Following the Tupac Amaru II rebellion (1780-81), Inkaist imagery (like depictions of the Sapa Inkas)&nbsp;was banned by Spanish colonial authorities who feared that depictions of aristocratic Inka forbearers as well as contemporary Inka nobility would incite subsequent uprisings. Genealogical Inka portraits, such as the Brooklyn series, would have been seen as subversive in this moment. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"In the Pre-Hispanic period (the period before Spanish colonization)&nbsp;the Inka did not have a tradition of portrait painting comparable to that of Europeans (the Inka&nbsp;Empire was on the west coast of South America, and included&nbsp;parts of present day Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia). However, following the Spanish Conquest (c. 1534) they quickly appropriated European painting conventions. For example, the images of Sapa Inkas (the sovereign Inka emperors) in Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala&rsquo;s famed illustrated chronicle <em>El primer nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</em> (<em>The First New Chronicle and Good Government</em>, c. 1615) are among the earliest examples of European-style portraiture executed by an indigenous artist.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The history is&nbsp;divided into eight decades, each of which is introduced by a unique, engraved title page. The title page (left) introducing the fifth decade was the model for the Brooklyn series of Inka rulers.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In both the engraving and the painted series, the figures&rsquo; postures and regalia as well as the strategies of representation correspond closely. The Inka kings are shown as half-length figures set in decorative roundels on which are inscribed their names and positions in the line of royal succession. Notably absent from the Herrera engraving is the image of Atahualpa. He is, though,&nbsp;included in the Brooklyn series&mdash;with an inscription that reads &ldquo;bastard tyrant Atahualpa.&rdquo; The increased scale of his figure in the roundel deviates from the conventions of the other thirteen portraits, such as those of Huayna Capac or Huascar.*</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f846dc883757764b7254c734baea2240c0e01272.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Right: <em>Huayna Capac, Twelfth Inka</em>, c. mid-18th century, oil on canvas, 23 1/2 x 21 11/16 inches (Brooklyn Museum of Art); left: <em>Huascar, Thirteenth Inka</em>, c. mid-18th century, oil on canvas, 23 1/2 x 21 11/16 inches (Brooklyn Museum of Art)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Atahualpa was the last Sapa Inka before the Spanish Conquest began around 1534. As the inscription on the Brooklyn portrait makes explicit, he was the illegitimate son of Sapa Inka Huayna Capac who&nbsp;died of smallpox in 1528.&nbsp;Although Atahualpa ultimately prevailed in&nbsp;a battle with his elder brother Huascar (born of a different mother) for control of the Inka empire&mdash;the timing of the victory was unfortunate. &nbsp;While the civil war raged, the Spanish conquistador Franciso Pizarro, who had landed in present-day Ecuador on his third expedition to the Americas, made his way southward along the western coast of the continent, pillaging and murdering as he traveled. In November of 1523, Atahualpa was celebrating his victory in the city of Cajamarca awaiting the arrival of his prisoner, his brother&nbsp;Huascar. &nbsp;He had learned of Pizarro&rsquo;s expedition party but believed a retinue of less than two hundred men posed little threat. On November 16 Atahualpa, sumptuously attired, rode into the plaza of Cajamarca atop a luxurious litter (a platform for passengers&nbsp;carried by people)&nbsp;accompanied by high ranking Inka nobles and several thousand guards. &nbsp;He was met by the Dominican friar Vicente de Valverde and an interpreter. &nbsp;After a tense exchange in which Atahualpa threw to the ground a book of Catholic prayers offered to him by Valverde, the friar called out to the Spaniards who had hidden themselves, their mounts and artillery in the buildings surrounding the plaza. Pizarro signaled his men to charge, and in the ambush that followed several thousand Andeans were massacred and Atahualpa was taken prisoner. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In captivity, Atahualpa quickly discovered the Spaniards&rsquo; lust for silver and gold. He offered Pizarro an impressive ransom in exchange for his freedom, promising to fill a room approximately 6.2m x 4.8m to half its height (2.5 meters) with gold objects and the same room twice over with silver objects. For the next eight months, gold and silver streamed into Cajamarca from across the empire. Beginning in June the Spaniards began melting down the cache of treasure and divvying up the spoils. After the ransom had been melted and dispersed&mdash;and in response to mounting pressure among the expedition party&mdash;Pizarro had Atahualpa executed on July 26, 1533, by garroting (a method of execution by which a tightened metal collar results in strangulation). &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Who owned this series?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the colonial period if you visited the home of a powerful <em>cacique</em> (an Indian chieftain or nobleman) you might see royal portraits depicting the succession of Inka kings displayed. Portraits of royal Inka&nbsp;genealogies were especially important in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries&mdash;these aristocratic genealogies were employed by the Inka elite to assert their privileged social status and claim political power in the viceroyalty. &nbsp;Following the Tupac Amaru II rebellion (1780-81), Inkaist imagery (like depictions of the Sapa Inkas)&nbsp;was banned by Spanish colonial authorities who feared that depictions of aristocratic Inka forbearers as well as contemporary Inka nobility would incite subsequent uprisings. Genealogical Inka portraits, such as the Brooklyn series, would have been seen as subversive in this moment. &nbsp;</p>\n"

Licensed under Fair use of copyrighted material in the context of Thomas Kuhn via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thomas_Kuhn.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Thomas_Kuhn.jpg\">Wikipedia</a></span></span><span>Thomas &nbsp;</span><span>Kuhn (1922 &ndash; 1996) was an American historian and philosopher of science who began his career in theoretical physics before switching career paths. His book, <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, which was first published in 1962, is one of the most cited academic books of all time and made Kuhn perhaps the most influential philosopher of science in the twentieth century. His work challenged the prevailing view of progress in &ldquo;normal science,&rdquo; which was that science has been a continuous increase in a set of accepted facts and theories. He argued that, instead, the history of science has been episodic, with periods of continuity interrupted by revolutionary science during which a new &ldquo;paradigm&rdquo; changes the rules and direction of scientific research. His analysis of science, which called into question its objectivity, caused a firestorm of controversy and continues to inspire reaction and debate in and beyond scientific communities.</span></p>\n"

"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>Normal science, the activity in which most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time, is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like. Much of the success of the enterprise derives from the community&rsquo;s willingness to defend that assumption, if necessary at considerable cost. Normal science, for example, often suppresses fundamental novelties<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[1]<!--[endif]--> because they are necessarily subversive<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[2]<!--[endif]--> of its basic commitments. Nevertheless, so long as those commitments retain an element of the arbitrary, the very nature of normal research ensures that novelty shall not be suppressed for very long. Sometimes a normal problem, one that ought to be solvable by known rules and procedures, resists the reiterated<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[3]<!--[endif]--> onslaught<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[4]<!--[endif]--> of the ablest members of the group within whose competence it falls.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On other occasions a piece of equipment designed and constructed for the purpose of normal research fails to perform in the anticipated manner, revealing an anomaly that cannot, despite repeated effort, be aligned with professional expectation. In these and other ways besides, normal science repeatedly goes astray. And when it does &mdash; when, that is, the profession can no longer evade<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[5]<!--[endif]--> anomalies that subvert<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[6]<!--[endif]--> the existing tradition of scientific practice &mdash; then begin the extraordinary investigations that lead the profession at last to a new set of commitments, a new basis for the practice of science. The extraordinary episodes in which that shift of professional commitments occurs are the ones known in this essay as scientific revolutions. They are the tradition-shattering complements<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[7]<!--[endif]--> to the tradition-bound activity of normal science.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The most obvious examples of scientific revolutions are those famous episodes in scientific development that have often been labeled revolutions before...the major turning points in scientific development associated with the names of Copernicus, Newton, Lavoisier, and Einstein. More clearly than most other episodes in the history of at least the physical sciences, these display what all scientific revolutions are about. Each of them necessitated the community&rsquo;s rejection of one time-honored scientific theory in favor of another incompatible with it. Each produced a consequent shift in the problems available for scientific scrutiny and in the standards by which the profession determined what should count as an admissible problem or as a legitimate problem-solution. And each transformed the scientific imagination in ways that we shall ultimately need to describe as a transformation of the world within which scientific work was done. Such changes, together with the controversies that almost always accompany them, are the defining characteristics of scientific revolutions.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>II. The Route to Normal Science</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p><span>In this essay, &lsquo;normal science&rsquo; means research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice. Today such achievements are recounted, though seldom in their original form, by science textbooks, elementary and advanced. These textbooks expound the body of accepted theory, illustrate many or all of its successful applications, and compare these applications with exemplary observations and experiments. Before such books became popular early in the nineteenth century (and until even more recently in the newly matured sciences), many of the famous classics of science fulfilled a similar function. Aristotle&rsquo;s Physica, Ptolemy&rsquo;s Almagest, Newton&rsquo;s Principia and Opticks, Franklin&rsquo;s Electricity, Lavoisier&rsquo;s Chemistry, and Lyell&rsquo;s Geology &mdash; these and many other works served for a time implicitly to define the legitimate problems and methods of a research field for succeeding generations of practitioners. They were able to do so because they shared two essential characteristics. Their achievement was sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity. Simultaneously, it was sufficiently open-ended to leave all sorts of problems for the redefined group of practitioners to resolve.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Achievements that share these two characteristics I shall henceforth refer to as &lsquo;paradigms,&rsquo; a term that relates closely to &lsquo;normal science.&rsquo; By choosing it, I mean to suggest that some accepted examples of actual scientific practice &mdash; examples which include law, theory, application, and instrumentation together &mdash; provide models from which spring particular coherent traditions of scientific research. These are the traditions which the historian describes under such rubrics as &lsquo;Ptolemaic astronomy&rsquo; (or &lsquo;Copernican&rsquo;), &lsquo;Aristotelian dynamics&rsquo; (or &lsquo;Newtonian&rsquo;),&hellip;and so on. The study of paradigms, including many that are far more specialized than those named illustratively above, is what mainly prepares the student for membership in the particular scientific community with which he will later practice. Because he there joins men who learned the bases of their field from the same concrete models, his subsequent practice will seldom evoke overt disagreement over fundamentals. Men whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice. That commitment and the apparent consensus</span><span>[8]</span><span> it produces are prerequisites for normal science, i.e., for the genesis</span><span>[9]</span><span> and continuation of a particular research tradition.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>History suggests that the road to a firm research consensus is extraordinarily arduous...</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>History also suggests, however, some reasons for the difficulties encountered on that road. In the absence of a paradigm or some candidate for paradigm, all of the facts that could possibly pertain to the development of a given science are likely to seem equally relevant. As a result, early fact-gathering is a far more nearly random activity than the one that subsequent scientific development makes familiar. Furthermore, in the absence of a reason for seeking some particular form of more recondite</span><span>[10]</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;information, early fact-gathering is usually restricted to the wealth of data that lie ready to hand&hellip;Because the&hellip;facts&hellip; could not have been casually discovered, technology has often played a vital role in the emergence of new sciences.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>&hellip;No natural history can be interpreted in the absence of at least some implicit body of intertwined theoretical and methodological belief that permits selection, evaluation, and criticism. If that body of belief is not already implicit in the collection of facts &mdash; in which case more than &ldquo;mere facts&rdquo; are at hand &mdash; it must be externally supplied&hellip;No wonder, then, that in the early stages of the development of any science different men confronting the same range of phenomena, but not usually&nbsp;</span><span>all the same particular phenomena, describe and interpret them in different ways. What is surprising, and perhaps also unique in its degree to the fields we call science, is that such initial divergences should ever largely disappear.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>&hellip;To be accepted as a paradigm, a theory must seem better than its competitors, but it need not, and in fact never does, explain all the facts with which it can be confronted...</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>&hellip;When, in the development of a natural science, an individual or group first produces a synthesis able to attract most of the next generation&rsquo;s practitioners, the older schools gradually disappear. In part their disappearance is caused by their members&rsquo; conversion to the new paradigm. But there are always some men who cling to one or another of the older views, and they are simply read out of the profession, which there- after ignores their work. The new paradigm implies a new and more rigid definition of the field. Those unwilling or unable to accommodate their work to it must proceed in isolation or attach themselves to some other group. [I]t is sometimes just its reception of a paradigm that transforms a group previously interested merely in the study of nature into a profession or, at least, a discipline&hellip;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>When the individual scientist can take a paradigm for granted, he need no longer, in his major works, attempt to build his field anew, starting from first principles and justifying the use of each concept introduced. That can be left to the writer of textbooks&hellip;</span></p>\n"

Licensed under Fair use of copyrighted material in the context of Thomas Kuhn via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thomas_Kuhn.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Thomas_Kuhn.jpg\">Wikipedia</a></span></span><span>Thomas &nbsp;</span><span>Kuhn (1922 &ndash; 1996) was an American historian and philosopher of science who began his career in theoretical physics before switching career paths. His book, <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, which was first published in 1962, is one of the most cited academic books of all time and made Kuhn perhaps the most influential philosopher of science in the twentieth century. His work challenged the prevailing view of progress in &ldquo;normal science,&rdquo; which was that science has been a continuous increase in a set of accepted facts and theories. He argued that, instead, the history of science has been episodic, with periods of continuity interrupted by revolutionary science during which a new &ldquo;paradigm&rdquo; changes the rules and direction of scientific research. His analysis of science, which called into question its objectivity, caused a firestorm of controversy and continues to inspire reaction and debate in and beyond scientific communities.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>I. A Role for History</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>Normal science, the activity in which most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time, is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like. Much of the success of the enterprise derives from the community&rsquo;s willingness to defend that assumption, if necessary at considerable cost. Normal science, for example, often suppresses fundamental novelties<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[1]<!--[endif]--> because they are necessarily subversive<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[2]<!--[endif]--> of its basic commitments. Nevertheless, so long as those commitments retain an element of the arbitrary, the very nature of normal research ensures that novelty shall not be suppressed for very long. Sometimes a normal problem, one that ought to be solvable by known rules and procedures, resists the reiterated<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[3]<!--[endif]--> onslaught<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[4]<!--[endif]--> of the ablest members of the group within whose competence it falls.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On other occasions a piece of equipment designed and constructed for the purpose of normal research fails to perform in the anticipated manner, revealing an anomaly that cannot, despite repeated effort, be aligned with professional expectation. In these and other ways besides, normal science repeatedly goes astray. And when it does &mdash; when, that is, the profession can no longer evade<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[5]<!--[endif]--> anomalies that subvert<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[6]<!--[endif]--> the existing tradition of scientific practice &mdash; then begin the extraordinary investigations that lead the profession at last to a new set of commitments, a new basis for the practice of science. The extraordinary episodes in which that shift of professional commitments occurs are the ones known in this essay as scientific revolutions. They are the tradition-shattering complements<!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[7]<!--[endif]--> to the tradition-bound activity of normal science.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The most obvious examples of scientific revolutions are those famous episodes in scientific development that have often been labeled revolutions before...the major turning points in scientific development associated with the names of Copernicus, Newton, Lavoisier, and Einstein. More clearly than most other episodes in the history of at least the physical sciences, these display what all scientific revolutions are about. Each of them necessitated the community&rsquo;s rejection of one time-honored scientific theory in favor of another incompatible with it. Each produced a consequent shift in the problems available for scientific scrutiny and in the standards by which the profession determined what should count as an admissible problem or as a legitimate problem-solution. And each transformed the scientific imagination in ways that we shall ultimately need to describe as a transformation of the world within which scientific work was done. Such changes, together with the controversies that almost always accompany them, are the defining characteristics of scientific revolutions.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>II. The Route to Normal Science</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p><span>In this essay, &lsquo;normal science&rsquo; means research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice. Today such achievements are recounted, though seldom in their original form, by science textbooks, elementary and advanced. These textbooks expound the body of accepted theory, illustrate many or all of its successful applications, and compare these applications with exemplary observations and experiments. Before such books became popular early in the nineteenth century (and until even more recently in the newly matured sciences), many of the famous classics of science fulfilled a similar function. Aristotle&rsquo;s Physica, Ptolemy&rsquo;s Almagest, Newton&rsquo;s Principia and Opticks, Franklin&rsquo;s Electricity, Lavoisier&rsquo;s Chemistry, and Lyell&rsquo;s Geology &mdash; these and many other works served for a time implicitly to define the legitimate problems and methods of a research field for succeeding generations of practitioners. They were able to do so because they shared two essential characteristics. Their achievement was sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity. Simultaneously, it was sufficiently open-ended to leave all sorts of problems for the redefined group of practitioners to resolve.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Achievements that share these two characteristics I shall henceforth refer to as &lsquo;paradigms,&rsquo; a term that relates closely to &lsquo;normal science.&rsquo; By choosing it, I mean to suggest that some accepted examples of actual scientific practice &mdash; examples which include law, theory, application, and instrumentation together &mdash; provide models from which spring particular coherent traditions of scientific research. These are the traditions which the historian describes under such rubrics as &lsquo;Ptolemaic astronomy&rsquo; (or &lsquo;Copernican&rsquo;), &lsquo;Aristotelian dynamics&rsquo; (or &lsquo;Newtonian&rsquo;),&hellip;and so on. The study of paradigms, including many that are far more specialized than those named illustratively above, is what mainly prepares the student for membership in the particular scientific community with which he will later practice. Because he there joins men who learned the bases of their field from the same concrete models, his subsequent practice will seldom evoke overt disagreement over fundamentals. Men whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice. That commitment and the apparent consensus</span><span>[8]</span><span> it produces are prerequisites for normal science, i.e., for the genesis</span><span>[9]</span><span> and continuation of a particular research tradition.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>History suggests that the road to a firm research consensus is extraordinarily arduous...</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>History also suggests, however, some reasons for the difficulties encountered on that road. In the absence of a paradigm or some candidate for paradigm, all of the facts that could possibly pertain to the development of a given science are likely to seem equally relevant. As a result, early fact-gathering is a far more nearly random activity than the one that subsequent scientific development makes familiar. Furthermore, in the absence of a reason for seeking some particular form of more recondite</span><span>[10]</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;information, early fact-gathering is usually restricted to the wealth of data that lie ready to hand&hellip;Because the&hellip;facts&hellip; could not have been casually discovered, technology has often played a vital role in the emergence of new sciences.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>&hellip;No natural history can be interpreted in the absence of at least some implicit body of intertwined theoretical and methodological belief that permits selection, evaluation, and criticism. If that body of belief is not already implicit in the collection of facts &mdash; in which case more than &ldquo;mere facts&rdquo; are at hand &mdash; it must be externally supplied&hellip;No wonder, then, that in the early stages of the development of any science different men confronting the same range of phenomena, but not usually&nbsp;</span><span>all the same particular phenomena, describe and interpret them in different ways. What is surprising, and perhaps also unique in its degree to the fields we call science, is that such initial divergences should ever largely disappear.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>&hellip;To be accepted as a paradigm, a theory must seem better than its competitors, but it need not, and in fact never does, explain all the facts with which it can be confronted...</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>&hellip;When, in the development of a natural science, an individual or group first produces a synthesis able to attract most of the next generation&rsquo;s practitioners, the older schools gradually disappear. In part their disappearance is caused by their members&rsquo; conversion to the new paradigm. But there are always some men who cling to one or another of the older views, and they are simply read out of the profession, which there- after ignores their work. The new paradigm implies a new and more rigid definition of the field. Those unwilling or unable to accommodate their work to it must proceed in isolation or attach themselves to some other group. [I]t is sometimes just its reception of a paradigm that transforms a group previously interested merely in the study of nature into a profession or, at least, a discipline&hellip;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>When the individual scientist can take a paradigm for granted, he need no longer, in his major works, attempt to build his field anew, starting from first principles and justifying the use of each concept introduced. That can be left to the writer of textbooks&hellip;</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Three translations of the same decree</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The inscriptions are three translations of the same decree, passed by a council of priests, that affirms the royal cult of the thirteen-year-old Ptolemy V on the first anniversary of his coronation. The decree is inscribed on the stone three times, in hieroglyphic (suitable for a priestly decree), demotic (the native script used for daily purposes), and Greek (the language of the administration). The importance of this to Egyptology is immense.&nbsp;In the early years of the nineteenth century, scholars were able to use the Greek inscription on this stone as the key to deciphering the others.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Opposition to the Ptolemies</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In previous years the family of the Ptolemies had lost control of certain parts of the country. It had taken their armies some time to put down opposition in the Delta, and parts of southern Upper Egypt, particularly Thebes, were not yet back under the government&#39;s control.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before the Ptolemaic era (that is before about 332 B.C.E.), decrees in hieroglyphs such as this were usually set up by the king. It shows how much things had changed from Pharaonic times that the priests, the only people who had kept the knowledge of writing hieroglyphs, were now issuing such decrees. The list of good deeds done by the king for the temples hints at the way in which the support of the priests was ensured.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The end of hieroglyphics</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Soon after the end of the fourth century C.E., when hieroglyphs had gone out of use, the knowledge of how to read and write them disappeared. In the early years of the nineteenth century, some 1400 years later, scholars were able to use the Greek inscription on this stone as the key to decipher them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The discovery</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Thomas Young, an English physicist, was the first to show that some of the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone wrote the sounds of a royal name, that of Ptolemy. The French scholar Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Champollion then realized that hieroglyphs recorded the sound of the Egyptian language and laid the foundations of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian language and culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Soldiers in Napoleon&#39;s army discovered the Rosetta Stone in 1799 while digging the foundations of an addition to a fort near the town of el-Rashid (Rosetta). On Napoleon&#39;s defeat, the stone became the property of the&nbsp;British under the terms of the Treaty of Alexandria (1801) along with other antiquities that the French had found.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Rosetta Stone has been exhibited in the British Museum since 1802, with only one break. Towards the end of the First World War, in 1917, when the Museum was concerned about heavy bombing in London, they moved it to safety along with other, portable, &#39;important&#39; objects. The Rosetta Stone spent the next two years in a station on the Postal Tube Railway&nbsp;50 feet below the ground at Holborn.</p>\n"

Part of grey and pink granodiorite stela bearing priestly decree concerning Ptolemy V in three blocks of text: Hieroglyphic (14 lines), Demotic (32 lines) and Greek (53 lines).</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Three translations of the same decree</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The inscriptions are three translations of the same decree, passed by a council of priests, that affirms the royal cult of the thirteen-year-old Ptolemy V on the first anniversary of his coronation. The decree is inscribed on the stone three times, in hieroglyphic (suitable for a priestly decree), demotic (the native script used for daily purposes), and Greek (the language of the administration). The importance of this to Egyptology is immense.&nbsp;In the early years of the nineteenth century, scholars were able to use the Greek inscription on this stone as the key to deciphering the others.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Opposition to the Ptolemies</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In previous years the family of the Ptolemies had lost control of certain parts of the country. It had taken their armies some time to put down opposition in the Delta, and parts of southern Upper Egypt, particularly Thebes, were not yet back under the government&#39;s control.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before the Ptolemaic era (that is before about 332 B.C.E.), decrees in hieroglyphs such as this were usually set up by the king. It shows how much things had changed from Pharaonic times that the priests, the only people who had kept the knowledge of writing hieroglyphs, were now issuing such decrees. The list of good deeds done by the king for the temples hints at the way in which the support of the priests was ensured.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The end of hieroglyphics</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Soon after the end of the fourth century C.E., when hieroglyphs had gone out of use, the knowledge of how to read and write them disappeared. In the early years of the nineteenth century, some 1400 years later, scholars were able to use the Greek inscription on this stone as the key to decipher them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The discovery</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Thomas Young, an English physicist, was the first to show that some of the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone wrote the sounds of a royal name, that of Ptolemy. The French scholar Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Champollion then realized that hieroglyphs recorded the sound of the Egyptian language and laid the foundations of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian language and culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Soldiers in Napoleon&#39;s army discovered the Rosetta Stone in 1799 while digging the foundations of an addition to a fort near the town of el-Rashid (Rosetta). On Napoleon&#39;s defeat, the stone became the property of the&nbsp;British under the terms of the Treaty of Alexandria (1801) along with other antiquities that the French had found.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Rosetta Stone has been exhibited in the British Museum since 1802, with only one break. Towards the end of the First World War, in 1917, when the Museum was concerned about heavy bombing in London, they moved it to safety along with other, portable, &#39;important&#39; objects. The Rosetta Stone spent the next two years in a station on the Postal Tube Railway&nbsp;50 feet below the ground at Holborn.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Translation of the demotic text</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>[Year 9, Xandikos day 4], which is equivalent to the Egyptian month, second month of Peret, day 18, of the King &quot;The Youth who has appeared as King in the place of his Father,&quot; the Lord of the Uraei &quot;Whose might is great, who has established Egypt, causing it to prosper, whose heart is beneficial before the gods...&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The vast geographic and environmental diversity of the North American continent has allowed one of the most culturally diverse regions on the planet to emerge.&nbsp;Societies across the continent have developed beautiful and complex material worlds that reflect the character and personality of their territories. Native North American peoples have responded to the universal problems of life in individual and ingenious ways, making best use of their natural resources to build strong and expressive communities. Here objects from the Museum&rsquo;s collection illustrate the ways in which separate Native American cultures have lived through a colonial period of immense social and environmental upheaval over the last three hundred years.<br />\n"

"<br />\n"
"<span>After the Archaic period came the Woodland peoples, from about 800 B.C.E., who lived in settled communities, hunting, fishing and gathering and cultivating plants. Large earthworks, such as those of the Ohio Hopewell culture (from about 100 B.C.E. to C.E.&nbsp;600), were created for religious, economic and defensive purposes.</span></p>\n"

European colonization and the expansion of the United States brought diseases and warfare that killed most of the native population. Bison, on which many depended for food, clothing, housing and tools, were hunted almost to extinction by commercial hunters. Further hardship came as many were forced to live in reservations.&nbsp;Continuing conflict culminated in the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 when United States troops massacred hundreds of Lakota after they had surrendered.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today, between two and three million people of native descent live in Canada and the United States of America. They are grouped into more than 1000 bands, tribes or nations all possessing their own oral literatures and histories; their survival and continued vibrancy a testament to the enduring strength of their traditions</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Eastern Woodlands</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The peoples of the expansive woodlands of Eastern America live in a large number of tribes, with related religious and linguistic traditions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people subsisted through hunting, fishing and limited agriculture, trading with and periodically making war on their neighbors. They were the first Native North American societies to experience the arrival of Europeans and despite regular outbreaks of disease and warfare, a significant cultural exchange took place as Europeans learned to live and travel in their New World. Native Americans quickly accessed new technologies and markets, fueling an explosion in trade that had a profound effect on all involved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Plains</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The people of the North American Plains were predominantly nomadic, living in large territories roamed by great herds of buffalo.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Early adopters of the horse, they lived in societies governed by profound military and religious traditions which produced richly decorated clothing and weaponry. The Plains peoples fought ferociously to maintain their independence as the European nations of North America spread westwards in the nineteenth century. Eventually, after decades of resistance, most Plains people were forced to live on reservations, where despite documented official efforts to eliminate them, traditional practices and languages have survived.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Southwest</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The peoples of the Southwestern United States have a long tradition of settled life that is reliant on agriculture.&nbsp;Diverse peoples with varied cultural and linguistic traditions, the people of the Southwest have long produced highly decorated pottery, jewelery and textiles. These objects form part of a cultural and technological exchange with Mexican societies to the south which remain central to a thriving market in contemporary art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Northwest coast</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The societies of the Northwest coast of North America developed in relative isolation between the Coastal Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Living in small communities on islands and in fjords, they utilized the huge cedar forests to construct the elaborate heraldic structures now known collectively as totem poles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The enthusiasm for carving stretched far beyond the poles, to encompass all areas of life on the coast and their ornate canoes could travel across hundreds of miles of ocean in search of fish, whales, trade or war. Control of the sea allowed chieftains to amass considerable wealth which they distributed to followers at elaborate feasts known as potlatches.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Masking, a performance art practiced widely on the coast, was an integral part of potlatches, where ancestral tales were performed in long houses before the tribe and their guests. Some, such as this example, were designed to transform mid-dance from one form to another, an essential part of Northwest Coast storytelling.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Arctic</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The shores of the North American continent around and to the north of the Arctic circle are inhabited by people speaking related, though distinct, Eskimo-Aleut languages: these are Aleut, Alutiiq, Yup&#39;ik and Inupiaq in Alaska; Siberian Yup&rsquo;ik, spoken by the Yuit in Alaska and Siberia; Inuktitut spoken by the Canadian Inuit; and Greenlandic spoken by the Greenland Inuit.</p>\n"

With hunting so vital to Arctic livelihood, a variety of specially adapted tools and techniques were developed specifically to catch and utilize prey both on land and by sea.</p>\n"

"<h3>Clothing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Arctic, where temperatures are below freezing for most of the year, warm clothing is of great importance. It is vital for hunters who spend many hours outside fishing or hunting seals, walrus, whales and caribou. Traditional Inuit skin clothing is well suited to this purpose because it provides excellent insulation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In winter, two layers of clothes were worn when hunting or traveling. The inner layer has the fur turned inwards towards the body, while the fur of the outer layer is turned outwards. Warm air is trapped between the two layers of clothing and the body, providing excellent insulation against the cold.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Today traditional skin clothing remains important to Inuit. Not only are certain kinds of traditional clothing still preferred over manufactured garments, but the making and use of clothing plays a significant role in keeping Inuit cultural values and knowledge alive. Clothing both sustains and expresses Inuit identity.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Amauti of this style were used by the Inuit of Labrador until their costume changed through the influence of missionaries in the eighteenth century.

"After Charlemagne&rsquo;s legacy had begun to die out, the warlike tribes in what is now Germany (then Saxony) banded together to elect a king from among their nobility.

"<h3>Wearing leather</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most medieval bindings were made out of animal skin&mdash;usually it was a calf or pig who involuntarily ended up protecting the manuscript. Leather proved an ideal material for binding books. It is stiff, which means it does an excellent job protecting the precious cargo inside, while at the same time adding to the desired &ldquo;firmness&rdquo; of the book. The material also repels water quite well. This benefit may seem odd, but it&rsquo;s not. While monks may not have been reading books in the bath tub, they did consult them in the cloister, which was often a damp environment&mdash;given that the hallways were in the open air.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>An added bonus of leather was that it accommodated blind-tooled decoration, which was applied in mesmerizing shapes and patterns. The oldest book to survive with its original binding still in place is the seventh-century St Cuthbert Gospel (which is a Gospel of John, in fact, image above). It shows just how utterly charming early-medieval leather bindings were; and how beautifully they were decorated. The manuscript in question was placed in the coffin of St Cuthbert shortly after his death in 687. It was discovered when the grave was opened in the early twelfth century. By then a cult had grown around St Cuthbert, so the book and its original binding&nbsp;were both&nbsp;well taken care of. In fact, the binding looks like it was made yesterday.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"London, British Library, Papyrus 1442 (dating 716-717)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/22578b12b6d6a9d79ab4348f00a1b24d405a13bd.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Leather binding used for a papyrus book,&nbsp;London, British Library, Papyrus 1442,&nbsp;dating 716-717</span></span>The use of leather bindings predates books made out of parchment&mdash;like the book of St Cuthbert. Before parchment became common, books were made from plants&mdash;papyrus. Such papyrus codices were extremely fragile and they needed the protective qualities of leather, which may ultimately be the origins of the tradition of using skin for bindings. Given that papyrus not used after the fifth century (with some exceptions), very few original bindings of papyrus books survive. The oldest specimens we have are those in the so-called Nag Hammadi Archive, which date back to the third and fourth centuries. As you can see from the image to the left, these covers of papyrus books were also decorated handsomely.</p>\n"

The answer is seen in the image above, which shows a book that was copied and bound in Iceland. Naturally the binder turned to creatures that were available there.&nbsp;This is how a poor seal ended up covering this <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/25300312@N08/5061772601/\">Old Icelandic book</a> with sermons, which was made around 1200. If you look carefully you can still see a significant amount of hair on the outside. As with other cases where animal hair is found on book covers, the hairs have turned green over time (or perhaps from the liquids involved in processing animal skin into leather).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But the skin used for bookbindings is not limited to animals. Under the name anthropdermic bibliopegy goes the practice of using human skin for binding books. It turns out to be a post-medieval practice, which was particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries. The <a href=\"http://erikkwakkel.tumblr.com/post/65363934535/halloween-2-bound-in-human-skin-this-beautiful\">cover seen here</a> dates from the early 17th century and the skin was taken from the priest Father Henry Garnet. He was executed in 1606 for his role in the Gunpowder Plot&mdash;the attempt to ignite 36 barrels of gunpowder under the British Parliament. The book in question actually outlines the story of the plot and the evidence of Garnet&rsquo;s guilt. The origins of the binding must have given the reader significant satisfaction.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The last word: cloth</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Not all medieval books were dressed up in leather. Less commonly used, perhaps because it is more fragile, is cloth. This material handled the frequent use of a book far less well than leather. The real-world use of a medieval book was such that the object would be pushed back and forth over a wooden desk, which did not exactly contribute to a long life. The cloth binding <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/25300312@N08/5062516396/in/set-72157625120216684/\">seen here</a>&nbsp;dates from the middle of the fifteenth century and it covers a monastic rule.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The manuscript has a particularly pretty button to close the volume up, adding&nbsp;to the charm of this beautiful bookbinding. In the age of the printed book such cloth bindings&nbsp;became more common, perhaps because&nbsp;more books were privately owned. This meant, of course, that the objects were not consulted on the hard surface of a wooden desk, but on the soft lap of the reader. As with embroidered bindings, which also increased in popularity in post-medieval times, cloth may have been regarded as a more suitable material for private reading.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Such papyrus codices were extremely fragile and they needed the protective qualities of leather, which may ultimately be the origins of the tradition of using skin for bindings. Given that papyrus not used after the fifth century (with some exceptions), very few original bindings of papyrus books survive. The oldest specimens we have are those in the so-called Nag Hammadi Archive, which date back to the third and fourth centuries (look at some images here). As you can see from the image to the left, these covers of papyrus books were also decorated handsomely.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Landsbókasafn Íslands, National and University Library of Iceland, GKS 2870 4to, Njáls saga, 1290-1310\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2d31adbd148d8d232434f8f5d13904ef16684e2c.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Seal skin binding.&nbsp;Landsb&oacute;kasafn &Iacute;slands, National and University Library of Iceland, GKS 2870 4to, Nj&aacute;ls saga, 1290-1310</span></span>What to do if you need a leather binding, but there are no cows or pigs to slaughter for this purpose? The answer is seen in the image above, which shows a book that was copied and bound in Iceland. Naturally the binder turned to creatures that were available there.&nbsp;This is how a poor seal ended up covering this <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/25300312@N08/5061772601/\">Old Icelandic book</a> with sermons, which was made around 1200. If you look carefully you can still see a significant amount of hair on the outside. As with other cases where animal hair is found on book covers, the hairs have turned green over time (or perhaps from the liquids involved in processing animal skin into leather).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But the skin used for bookbindings is not limited to animals. Under the name anthropdermic bibliopegy goes the practice of using human skin for binding books. It turns out to be a post-medieval practice, which was particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries. The <a href=\"http://erikkwakkel.tumblr.com/post/65363934535/halloween-2-bound-in-human-skin-this-beautiful\">cover seen here</a> dates from the early 17th century and the skin was taken from the priest Father Henry Garnet. He was executed in 1606 for his role in the Gunpowder Plot&mdash;the attempt to ignite 36 barrels of gunpowder under the British Parliament. The book in question actually outlines the story of the plot and the evidence of Garnet&rsquo;s guilt. The origins of the binding must have given the reader significant satisfaction.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The last word: cloth</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Not all medieval books were dressed up in leather. Less commonly used, perhaps because it is more fragile, is cloth. This material handled the frequent use of a book far less well than leather. The real-world use of a medieval book was such that the object would be pushed back and forth over a wooden desk, which did not exactly contribute to a long life. The cloth binding <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/25300312@N08/5062516396/in/set-72157625120216684/\">seen here</a>&nbsp;dates from the middle of the fifteenth century and it covers a monastic rule.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The manuscript has a particularly pretty button to close the volume up, adding&nbsp;to the charm of this beautiful bookbinding. In the age of the printed book such cloth bindings&nbsp;became more common, perhaps because&nbsp;more books were privately owned. This meant, of course, that the objects were not consulted on the hard surface of a wooden desk, but on the soft lap of the reader. As with embroidered bindings, which also increased in popularity in post-medieval times, cloth may have been regarded as a more suitable material for private reading.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>The Leiden artifact (above) shows all the characteristics of a rotating bookmark: a small parchment disk with four numbers and a tiny hole in the middle. Interestingly, it is only the second specimen identified in Dutch collections, although the one in Leiden is clearly the oldest of the two (<a href=\"http://www.mmdc.nl/static/site/search/detail.html?searchMode=advanced&amp;recordId=7370&amp;selectedRecordId=7370&amp;maximumRecords=15&amp;recordDisplayLevel=1&amp;startRecord=1&amp;showMap=1&amp;freetextsearch=bookmark&amp;shelfmark=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;author=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;title=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;startyear=Type+in+query&amp;endyear=Type+in+query&amp;alt-title=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;incipit=Type+in+query&amp;annotation_contents=Type+in+query&amp;contains=null&amp;language=null&amp;language_original=null&amp;translator=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;type=null&amp;keyword=Type+in+query&amp;person=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;medium=null&amp;script=Type+in+query&amp;scribe=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;binding=null&amp;binder=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;region=null&amp;place=Type+in+query&amp;patron=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29&amp;collection=Type+in+query...+%28autocompleted%29#r7370\">here is the other</a>). While it is hard to date the red roman numbers with precision, it appears they were put on the parchment in the fourteenth century. The striking difference with the Houghton Library specimen above is that the new find comes without its sleeve, which does not survive. It is astonishing still that the tiny disk made it to our day and age. It must have been hidden in the darkness of a manuscript for several hundreds of years until it got separated and became an orphan&mdash; sleeveless and without a home.</p>\n"

"Michelangelo returned to Florence from Rome in 1501 at the age of twenty-six, and remained there for four years. This was to be one of the most productive periods of his life, and he became a lifelong supporter of Florentine republicanism during this time.</p>\n"

"<h3>Battle of Cascina</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The republican government of Florence commissioned Michelangelo and his great Florentine rival, Leonardo da Vinci, to paint enormous battle scenes celebrating historic Florentine victories in the Palazzo Vecchio. However, these patriotic works were never realized. Michelangelo&rsquo;s only contribution was a large-scale drawing, or cartoon, intended as the central section of the planned composition called the Battle of Cascina, which no longer survives.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Battle of Cascina was a famous fourteenth-century victory over Pisa. Michelangelo&#39;s Bathers depicted the Florentine army hurriedly preparing for battle after a dip in the river. Michelangelo&rsquo;s drawing caused a sensation because of his dynamic portrayal of over life-size figures in action. Many artists flocked to study Michelangelo&rsquo;s hugely influential cartoon. They were thrilled by the way he showed nude and semi nude figures in a variety of &nbsp;unique poses, the whole scene pulsating with movement and drama.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figure is of crucial importance in the larger scene because his turning body directs attention to the bodies behind. Close inspection of the figure reveals that, despite the remarkably realistic three-dimensional rendering, his pose is unnatural. This is particularly true of the upper body, which has been twisted to impossible limits.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Summoned to Rome: the Sistine Chapel ceiling</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Michelangelo was summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II in 1505, spending the years 1508 to 1512 decorating the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican palace.&nbsp;The thirty-three year-old artist had little&nbsp;experience of fresco technique, and the ceiling painting was an extraordinary achievement.&nbsp;Michelangelo&rsquo;s design was a very ambitious one that included painting an architectural framework. He divided the ceiling (over 40m long) into nine&nbsp;compartments, filled with fresco scenes of the creation of the world and man&rsquo;s early history as told in the Bible.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Creation of Adam</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This is the only surviving study for Adam in the&nbsp;<em>Creation of Adam</em>.&nbsp;He painted the figure of Adam, on the second half of the ceiling, around 1511. Adam&nbsp;reclines on his right side, his left arm resting on his left leg stretches out to receive life from God. At the lower left is a study for his right hand.&nbsp;The figure&rsquo;s stretching motion seems&nbsp;natural but in fact relies on an impossible dislocation of the upper body. Michelangelo is blurring the boundaries between the realities of the human figure and an invented ideal form.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>According to the Bible, Adam was the first man to be created by God. Michelangelo manages to make the impossible position of Adam&#39;s upper body look convincing, because his observation of his muscular form and the play of light on it is compellingly realistic.&nbsp;Michelangelo must have made a number of further drawings of Adam before the production of the cartoon (the full-size drawing which would have been transferred onto the ceiling). The head and the hands are only in outline here so would have needed refining.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Michelangelo has exploited the qualities of the red chalk to create a warmth of tone as he drew from the live model. He concentrated on the torso and upper legs of his model whose ideal anatomy is indicated by shading, especially on the chest and stomach areas. Around the outside of the whole body he has reinforced the edge with a strong line. The figure appears to be as much like a sculpture as a painting, and Michelangelo considered himself primarily a sculptor.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>From small studies to large figures</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The drawing is a rare survivor&nbsp;from the many hundreds that Michelangelo made to prepare the ceiling. How did he transform these&nbsp;small-scale figures into their gigantic counterparts on the ceiling? The normal method of enlarging a drawing was to overlay it with a grid of squares, which allowed the design to be copied into larger squares on a cartoon. Michelangelo then transferred the figures to the wet plaster, either by cutting through the outlines on the paper with a knife, or by dusting charcoal through holes punctured in the cartoon.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Fresco</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Fresco painting is notoriously difficult, as it involves applying water-based pigments to wet plaster and has to be done very quickly. Nevertheless, Michelangelo appears to have painted the vault almost single-handed. He soon&nbsp;dismissed his assistants, an indication perhaps of his perfectionism and single-mindedness. The fresco was painted from a stepped scaffold suspended on wooden rafters. This meant that Michelangelo painted standing up&mdash;contrary to popular belief that he lay on his back.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Examination of the Sistine vault has shown that Michelangelo quickened the pace at which he painted in the second phase of his work. This change in tempo was due to a growing command of painting in fresco that allowed him to work with greater confidence. His desire to finish such a physically exhausting project, coupled with the pressure almost certainly exerted on him by his impatient patron, may also have contributed to his speed. However his preparation methods remained as meticulous as before.</p>\n"

He returned to Florence in 1501 and the next four years - during which he became a lifelong supporter of Florentine republicanism - was one of the most productive periods of his life.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>First, you should <u><strong>challenge yourself with difficult coursework</strong></u> and then <u><strong>do well in these courses</strong></u>. &nbsp;Look for opportunities to take honors, AP, or IB courses which are recognized as offering a rigorous experience to students. &nbsp;Also consider dual-enrolling at a nearby community college or college during your junior or senior year of high school, earning college credit while taking challenging courses that are not offered in your high school. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to taking challenging courses and doing well, it&rsquo;s <u><strong>important to take the right mix of classes</strong></u>. &nbsp;More selective colleges prefer high school students who take at least five core academic classes most semesters (math, english, history, science, foreign language), in addition to a few classes in the arts. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look at these subjects in more detail to prioritize potential courses:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Math</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Math is a subject that builds on itself over the years, becoming increasingly complex as you increase your skills. &nbsp;Most colleges want students to have at least 3 years of high school math, though more&nbsp;selective colleges prefer 4 years. &nbsp;Prioritize taking several of&nbsp;the following courses:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Algebra 1</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Geometry</p>\n"

"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Pre-calculus &amp;&nbsp;Calculus</p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Begin with Algebra 1 and Geometry, often considered the building blocks of higher level math and science classes. &nbsp;Wrap up with Calculus, the highest level of math offered by many high schools and often considered the gold standard of pre-college math preparation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>English /&nbsp;Language Arts</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Given the substantial reading and writing requirements of higher education, virtually all&nbsp;colleges expect you to take 4 years of English. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>History /&nbsp;Social Studies</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>History courses offer insight into the world around you, and they also improve&nbsp;your critical reading and writing abilities. &nbsp;College-bound students often take a minimum of 3 years of history courses, prioritizing&nbsp;the following:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"

"<p>Once these standard history courses&nbsp;are completed, college-bound students often choose to&nbsp;take an additional&nbsp;class&nbsp;in an area of history specific to the expertise of&nbsp;instructors in their particular high school. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Science</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Science teaches you how to analyze information and apply theories to the real world. &nbsp;Most colleges prefer that students take at least 3 years of laboratory science classes, while more selective&nbsp;colleges prefer 4 years. &nbsp;Some specific classes to prioritize:</p>\n"

"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Foreign Language</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In an increasingly globalized world, having&nbsp;some basic mastery in a language besides English is highly encouraged as part of your high school studies. &nbsp;Most colleges prefer that you take at least 2 full years of the same foreign language, though many students choose to take 3-4 years. &nbsp;It is not advisable to switch between multiple languages; instead, it&rsquo;s best to choose a language of focus your freshman year and study it deeply throughout high school.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Arts</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Though not considered core academic courses, classes in the arts broaden your high school experience and give you the opportunity to build a skillset outside of typical academics. &nbsp;Many colleges recommend one or two semesters in the arts, though students who have a particular passion for a subject often choose to pursue it throughout their 4 years in high school.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Using Khan Academy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Everyday in class, students practice missions on Khan Academy for forty minutes. &nbsp;Students move through the mission that is best suited for them, rather than one that is dependent solely on their grade level. In Amanda&rsquo;s class, there are 7th graders working in 4th grade and some 7th graders are working on Algebra - there isn&rsquo;t one level of material. Amanda also mentions that students who tend to struggle with or fear math let go of that fear because of the freedom that this individualized learning time brings.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Motivating students</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Amanda&rsquo;s students are incentivized by badges, energy points, and the instant feedback that KA provides. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to the built-in rewards, students are motivated to challenge themselves through &ldquo;Khantests,&rdquo; which are weekly contests that Amanda created. Once students reach their goal for the week - whether it is spending 120 minutes on KA per week or achieving a certain badge - they put their names in a raffle to win prizes. Amanda believes that this technique is especially useful for students who have math anxiety and a lack of confidence in school. &nbsp;Using metrics such as badges and energy points, Amanda uses a weekly leaderboard to recognize students who go above and beyond.</p>\n"

"<p>History has no natural divisions. A woman living in Florence in the 15th century did not think of herself as a woman of the Renaissance. Historians divide history into large and small units in order to make characteristics and changes clear to themselves and to students. It&rsquo;s important to remember that any historical period is a construction and a simplification. Below are some important basics to get you started.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As you read the timeline below, please keep in mind that equally momentous developments have occurred in Africa, Asia, the Americas and in the Pacific.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Prehistoric (before c.&nbsp;3000 B.C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf), c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E., Limestone, 4 1/4&quot; high (Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e55a245465c17f7e2a1e9c4da8b6531d9feaf13f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf)</em>, c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E., Limestone, 4 1/4&quot; high (Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna),&nbsp;photo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/profzucker/7279700294\">Steven Zucker</a>&nbsp;<br />\n"
"(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>The term &ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo; refers to the time before written history. In the West, writing was invented in ancient Mesopotamia just before 3000 B.C.E., so this period includes visual culture (paintings, sculpture, and architecture) made before that date. The oldest decorative forms we can recognize as art come from Africa and may date back to 100,000 B.C.E. In contrast, the oldest cave paintings known are about 40,800 years old, and although we used to think that only our species, Homo Sapiens, made art&mdash;anthropologists now speculate that Neanderthals may have made at least some of these very early images.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Neolithic revolution, one of the most profound developments in all of human history, occurs during the Prehistoric Era. This is when our ancestors learned to farm and domesticate animals, allowing them to give up their nomadic ways, and settle down to build cities and civilizations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ancient (c. 3000 B.C.E. to c. 400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This period includes the great early civilizations of the ancient Near East (think Babylonia), ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, the Etruscans, and the Romans&mdash;everything that comes after the invention of writing and before the fall of the Roman Empire. Keep in mind the disintegration of the Roman Empire took centuries, but to simplify, c. 400 will do.</p>\n"

This period is often credited with the birth of Western philosophy, mathematics, theater, science, and democracy. The Romans in turn created an empire that extended across most of Europe, and all the lands that surround the Mediterranean Sea. They were expert administrators and engineers and they saw themselves as the inheritors of the great civilizations that came before them, particularly, Greece and Egypt (which they conquered).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that although history is often presented as a series of discrete stories, in reality narratives often overlap making history both more complex and more interesting. For example, it was also during the Roman Empire that the figure we now call Jesus lived. Jesus and his apostles were Jewish men living in what is today Israel, but which was then part of the Roman Empire.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Middle Ages (c. 400 C.E. to c. 1400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first half of this thousand-year period witnessed terrible political and economic upheaval in Western Europe, as waves of invasions by migrating peoples destabilized the Roman Empire. The Roman emperor Constantine established Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) as a new capital in the East in 330 C.E. and the Western Roman Empire broke apart soon after. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the Byzantine Empire (with Constantinople as its capital), flourished.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Christianity spread across what had been the Roman Empire&mdash;even among migrating invaders (Vandals, Visigoths, etc.).&nbsp;The Christian Church, headed by the Pope, emerged as the most powerful institution in Western Europe, the Orthodox Church dominated in the East.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It was during this period that Islam, one of the three great monotheistic religions, was born. Within little more than a century of the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 C.E., Islam had become an empire that stretched from Spain across North Africa, the Middle and Near East, to India. Medieval Islam was a leader in science and technology and established some of the world&rsquo;s great centers of learning (i.e. Cordoba). Islamic culture played an important role in preserving and translating ancient Greek texts at a time when much of the knowledge created during the ancient world was lost.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Petrarch (a writer who lived in the 1300s) described the early Medieval period as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; because to him it seemed to be a period of declining human achievement, especially when he compared it to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. The &ldquo;Middle Ages&rdquo; got its name because Renaissance scholars saw it as a long barbaric period that separated them from the great civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome that they both celebrated and emulated.</p>\n"

"<p>Medieval society was organized into clearly defined strata. At the top was the king. Below were lesser nobles. These lords in turn, ruled over peasants and serfs (the vast majority of the population). Serfs were laborers who were permanently bound to work the land owned by their lord. The basic unit of this system, known as Feudalism, was the lord/vassal relationship. The vassal would provide labor (in the fields or in battle) to the lord in exchange for land and protection. Mobility between strata was very rare.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of course, the thousand years of the Middle Ages saw the creation of many great works of art and literature, but they were different from what Petrarch valued. The works of art created in the Middle Ages were largely focused on the teachings of the Church.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is important to remember that during the Middle Ages it was rare that anyone except members of the clergy (monks, priests, etc.) could read and write. Despite expectations that the world would end in the year 1,000, Western Europe became increasingly stable, and this period is sometimes referred to as the Late (or High) Middle Ages. This period saw the renewal of large scale building and the re-establishment of sizable towns. Monasteries, such as Cluny, became wealthy and important centers of learning.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Within the Middle Ages, there are subdivisions in art history, including Early Christian, Byzantine, Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque and Gothic. When we look closely at much of the art and politics of the 1,000 years of the Middle Ages, we find a complex and ongoing relationship with the memory and legacy of the ancient Roman empire and this is the foundation for the Renaissance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Renaissance (c. 1400 to 1600)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In part, the Renaissance was a rebirth of interest in ancient Greek and Roman culture. It was also a period of economic prosperity in Europe&mdash;particularly in Italy and in Northern Europe. In art history, we study both the Italian Renaissance and the Northern Renaissance. We talk about a way of looking at the world called Humanism, which&mdash;at its most basic&mdash;placed renewed value on human knowledge, and the experience of this world (as opposed to focusing largely on the heavenly realm), using ancient Greek and Roman literature and art as a model.</p>\n"

The invention and adoption of the printing press was certainly one. As a result of the wider availability of books, literacy rates in Europe dramatically increased. Readers were empowered and in many ways we can trace the origin of our own information revolution to 15th-century Germany and Gutenberg&rsquo;s first printing press.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1517 a German theologian and monk, Martin Luther, challenged the authority of the Pope and sparked the Protestant Reformation. His ideas spread quickly, thanks in part to the printing press. By challenging the power of the Church, and asserting the authority of individual conscience (it was increasingly possible for people to read the bible in the language that they spoke), the Reformation laid the foundation for the value that modern culture places on the individual.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is also during this period that the Scientific Revolution began and observation replaced religious doctrine as the source of our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Copernicus up-ended the ancient Greek model of the heavens by suggesting that the sun was at the center of the solar system and that the planets orbited in circles around it. However, there were still problems with getting this theory to match observation. At the beginning of the 17th century, Kepler theorized (correctly!) that the planets moved in elliptical orbits (not circular ones) and that the speed of the orbits varied according to the planets&rsquo; distance from the sun. So much for the ideal geometries of the Greeks!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Early Modern (c. 1600 - 1800)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It might seem strange to date the beginning of the &quot;modern era&quot; to so long ago, but in many ways it was the scientific, political and economic revolutions of the 17th and&nbsp;18th&nbsp;centuries that have most shaped our own society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians study the Baroque style of the 17th century. This was a time of extended and often violent conflict between Catholics and Protestants made all the more complex because of the growing power of&nbsp;Europe&rsquo;s great monarchies. It was a time when nations grew in size, wealth and autonomy and when national boundaries were hardened, prefiguring the countries we know today (France, Spain and England for example). This was also a period of colonization, when European powers divided and exploited the world&rsquo;s natural resources and people for their own benefit&nbsp;(think especially of the African slave trade, or the subjugation and forced conversion of the indigenous&nbsp;peoples of the Americas).<br />\n"

In many ways, it furthers the interest in the individual seen in the Italian Renaissance and more widely during the Protestant Reformation. Thinkers such as Rousseau, Voltaire and Diderot asserted our ability to reason for ourselves instead of relying on the teachings of established institutions, such as the Church. In art history we study the Rococo and Neoclassical styles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The American and French Revolutions date to this period. The emerging middle classes (and later the working-classes) began a centuries-long campaign to gain political power, challenging the control of the aristocracy and monarchy. Successive reform movements (in this period and the 19th century) and revolutions gradually extended the franchise (the right to vote). Previously suffrage had been limited to males who owned land or who paid a certain amount in taxes. It was only in the second half of the 19th and the 20th centuries that universal suffrage became the norm in Europe and North America.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Modern (after c. 1800)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Capitalism became the dominant economic system during this period (though it had its roots in the Renaissance). Individuals risked capital to produce goods in a currency-based market which depended on inexpensive, waged labor. Labor eventually organized into unions (latter-day guilds) and in this way, asserted considerable influence. More broadly shared political power was bolstered by overall increases in the standard of living and the first experiments in public education.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Steam-powered machines and unskilled laborers in factories began to replace skilled artisans. London, Paris, and New York led the unprecedented population growth of cities during this period, as people moved from the countryside or emigrated to find a higher standard of living.</p>\n"

It included two world wars, the Cold War, the dismantling of colonialism and the invention of the Totalitarian state. Dictators (Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, the successive leaders of North Korea, etc.) imposed extreme political systems that caused mass starvation, mass dislocations and genocide. At the same time, the 20th Century was marked by the struggle for human rights and the rise of global capitalism.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where artists had previously worked under the instructions of wealthy patrons associated with the church or state, in this period, art became part of the market economy, and art itself came to be seen as personal self-expression. The high value placed on the individual, which emerged in ancient Greece and Rome and then again in the Renaissance, became the primary value of Western culture. Where artistic styles (for example, Baroque) had once covered numerous artists working over broad regions and periods of time, in the late Nineteenth and through the 20th Century, successive styles of art change with increasing speed and fracture into a kaleidoscope of individual artistic practices.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Where do we fit in?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We are immersed in our own time and it can be difficult to see the world around us objectively. One of the modern definitions of an artist, in fact, is someone who is particularly insightful about their own cultural moment. Thanks to global capitalism, social media and the internet, we are more interconnected and interdependent than at any other time in history. Some see this as a utopian moment. With internet access, we can all contribute to and benefit from what is being called the Information Revolution. For others, the prevalence of technology in our lives threatens our individuality and privacy, and reduces us to a data point that can be monetized by corporations like Facebook, Google, and Apple. One thing is certain, throughout the time periods sketched above, art has meant different things, and it is likely to be differently defined in the future.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The history of humanity is recorded in our visual culture. Like the fate of previous civilizations, time will eventually destroy much of the visual culture that we are familiar with today. Future art historians will seek to reconstruct the world we now live in, to better understand the nuanced meanings that are so familiar to us. Perhaps someday an art historian will puzzle over an internet meme, a Torqued Ellipse by Richard Serra, or school-yard graffiti.</p>\n"

"<p>History has no natural divisions. A woman living in Florence in the 15th century did not think of herself as a woman of the Renaissance. Historians divide history into large and small units in order to make characteristics and changes clear to themselves and to students. It&rsquo;s important to remember that any historical period is a construction and a simplification. Below are some important basics to get you started.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As you read the timeline below, please keep in mind that equally momentous developments have occurred in Africa, Asia, the Americas and in the Pacific.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Prehistoric (before c.&nbsp;3000 B.C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf), c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E., Limestone, 4 1/4&quot; high (Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e55a245465c17f7e2a1e9c4da8b6531d9feaf13f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf)</em>, c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E., Limestone, 4 1/4&quot; high (Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna),&nbsp;photo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/profzucker/7279700294\">Steven Zucker</a>&nbsp;<br />\n"
"(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>The term &ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo; refers to the time before written history. In the West, writing was invented in ancient Mesopotamia just before 3000 B.C.E., so this period includes visual culture (paintings, sculpture, and architecture) made before that date. The oldest decorative forms we can recognize as art come from Africa and may date back to 100,000 B.C.E. In contrast, the oldest cave paintings known are about 40,800 years old, and although we used to think that only our species, Homo Sapiens, made art&mdash;anthropologists now speculate that Neanderthals may have made at least some of these very early images.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Neolithic revolution, one of the most profound developments in all of human history, occurs during the Prehistoric Era. This is when our ancestors learned to farm and domesticate animals, allowing them to give up their nomadic ways, and settle down to build cities and civilizations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ancient (c. 3000 B.C.E. to c. 400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This period includes the great early civilizations of the ancient Near East (think Babylonia), ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, the Etruscans, and the Romans&mdash;everything that comes after the invention of writing and before the fall of the Roman Empire. Keep in mind the disintegration of the Roman Empire took centuries, but to simplify, c. 400 will do.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/33ce6801addfb004da4cac57ab2cd49d441bd126.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ancient Greek sculpture of &nbsp;Zeus or Poseidon, c. 460 B.C.E., bronze, 2.09 m high, Early Classical (Severe Style), recovered from a shipwreck off Cape Artemision, Greece in 1928 (National Archaeological Museum, Athens), photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/profzucker/13140681474/in/photostream/\">Steven Zucker</a> (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>It was during this period that the ancient Greeks first applied human reason to their observations of the natural world and created some of the earliest naturalistic images of human beings. This period is often credited with the birth of Western philosophy, mathematics, theater, science, and democracy. The Romans in turn created an empire that extended across most of Europe, and all the lands that surround the Mediterranean Sea. They were expert administrators and engineers and they saw themselves as the inheritors of the great civilizations that came before them, particularly, Greece and Egypt (which they conquered).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that although history is often presented as a series of discrete stories, in reality narratives often overlap making history both more complex and more interesting. For example, it was also during the Roman Empire that the figure we now call Jesus lived. Jesus and his apostles were Jewish men living in what is today Israel, but which was then part of the Roman Empire.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Middle Ages (c. 400 C.E. to c. 1400 C.E.)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first half of this thousand-year period witnessed terrible political and economic upheaval in Western Europe, as waves of invasions by migrating peoples destabilized the Roman Empire. The Roman emperor Constantine established Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) as a new capital in the East in 330 C.E. and the Western Roman Empire broke apart soon after. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the Byzantine Empire (with Constantinople as its capital), flourished.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Christianity spread across what had been the Roman Empire&mdash;even among migrating invaders (Vandals, Visigoths, etc.).&nbsp;The Christian Church, headed by the Pope, emerged as the most powerful institution in Western Europe, the Orthodox Church dominated in the East.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It was during this period that Islam, one of the three great monotheistic religions, was born. Within little more than a century of the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 C.E., Islam had become an empire that stretched from Spain across North Africa, the Middle and Near East, to India. Medieval Islam was a leader in science and technology and established some of the world&rsquo;s great centers of learning (i.e. Cordoba). Islamic culture played an important role in preserving and translating ancient Greek texts at a time when much of the knowledge created during the ancient world was lost.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Petrarch (a writer who lived in the 1300s) described the early Medieval period as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; because to him it seemed to be a period of declining human achievement, especially when he compared it to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. The &ldquo;Middle Ages&rdquo; got its name because Renaissance scholars saw it as a long barbaric period that separated them from the great civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome that they both celebrated and emulated.</p>\n"

"<h3>High civilization</h3>\n"

"<p>This sculpture is an exquisite example of art from ancient Mesoamerica, an area of high civilization that includes the territory of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of El Salvador and Honduras. Long before the coming of the Spanish in the sixteenth century, this area independently developed cities and created monumental architecture and sculpture in the city center. Cities were thriving before 1000 B.C.E., or 2,000 years before this sculpture was carved. Important ancient Mesoamerican beings&mdash;noble men and women as well as deities&mdash;were often immortalized in stone and placed in important public places.&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know if the young man seen on the front of this stela represented a young ruler or a god, but we can say that this was an important figure that would have been placed in the center an ancient city, as a focal point for religious ritual.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Stonehenge, on Salisbury plain in England, is one of the most recognizable monuments of the Neolithic world and one of the most popular, with over one million visitors a year. People come to see Stonehenge because it is so impossibly big and so impossibly old; some are searching for a connection with a prehistoric past; some come to witness the workings of a massive astrological observatory. The people living in the fourth millennium BC who began work on Stonehenge were contemporary with the first dynasties of Ancient Egypt, and their efforts predate the building of the Pyramids. What they created has endured millennia and still intrigues us today.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Phase One</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In fact, what we see today is the result of at least three phases of construction, although there is still a lot of controversy among archaeologists about exactly how and when these phases occurred. It is generally agreed that the first phase of construction at Stonehenge occurred around 3100 BCE, when a great circular ditch about six feet deep was dug with a bank of dirt within it about 360 feet in diameter, with a large entrance to the northeast and a smaller one to the south. This circular ditch and bank together is called a henge. &nbsp;Within the henge were dug 56 pits, each slightly more than three feet in diameter, called Aubrey holes, after John Aubrey, the 17th century English archaeologist who first found them. These holes, it is thought, were either originally filled with upright bluestones or upright wooden beams. If it was bluestones which filled the Aubrey holes, it involved quite a bit of effort as each weighed between 2 and 4 tons and were mined from the Preseli Hills, about 250 miles away in Wales.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Phase Two</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The second phase of work at Stonehenge occurred approximately 100-200 years later and involved the setting up of upright wooden posts, possibly of a roofed structure, in the center of the henge, as well as more upright posts near the northeast and southern entrances. Surprisingly, it is also during this second phase at Stonehenge that it was used for burial. At least 25 of the Aubrey holes were emptied and reused to hold cremation burials and another 30 cremation burial pits were dug into the ditch of the henge and in the eastern portion within the henge enclosure. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Phase Three</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The third phase of construction at Stonehenge happened approximately 400-500 years later and likely lasted a long time. In this phase the remaining blue stones or wooden beams which had been placed in the Aubrey holes were pulled and a circle 108 feet in diameter of 30 huge and very hard sarsen stones were erected within the henge; these were quarried from nearby Marlborough Downs. These upright sarsen stones were capped with 30 lintel stones.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Interior of the sarsen circle and bluestones in the foreground\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fdf653e0d32abceac9fcb05ab869c90eaab726a5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Interior of the sarsen circle and bluestones in the foreground</span></span>Each standing stone was around 13 feet high, almost seven feet wide and weighed around 25 tons. &nbsp;This ring of stones enclosed five sarsen trilithons (a trilithon is a pair of upright stones with a lintel stone spanning their tops) set up in a horseshoe shape 45 feet across. These huge stones, ten uprights and five lintels, weigh up to 50 tons each. Bluestones, either reinstalled or freshly quarried, were erected in a circle, half in the outer sarsen circle and half within the sarsen horseshoe. At the end of the phase there is some rearrangement of the bluestones as well as the construction of a long processional avenue, consisting of parallel banks with exterior ditches approximately 34 meters across, leading from the northeast entrance to Stonehenge, dipping to the south and eventually to the banks of the Avon river. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Questions</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>All three phases of the construction of Stonehenge pose fascinating questions. The first phase of work required precise planning and a massive amount of labor. Who planned the henge and who organized whom to work together in its construction? &nbsp;Unfortunately, remains of Neolithic villages, which would provide information about who built Stonehenge, are few, possibly because so many lie underneath later Bronze Age, Roman, Medieval and modern cities. The few villages that have been explored show simple farming hamlets with very little evidence of widely differing social status. If there were leaders or a social class who convinced or forced people to work together to build the first phase of Stonehenge, we haven&rsquo;t found them. It also probably means the first phase of Stonehenge&rsquo;s construction was an egalitarian endeavor, highly unusual for the ancient world.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Who were the people buried at Stonehenge during&nbsp;its second phase? Recent analysis of these bones has revealed that nearly all the burials were of adult males, aged 25-40 years, in good health and with little sign of hard labor or disease. No doubt, to be interred at Stonehenge was a mark of elite status and these remains may well be those of some of the first political leaders of Great Britain, an island with a ruling tradition extending all the way to the House of Windsor. They also show us that in this era, some means of social distinction must have been desirable.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work achieved in the long third phase of Stonehenge&rsquo;s construction, however, is the one which is most remarkable and enduring. Like the first phase of Stonehenge, except on a much larger scale, the third phase involved tremendous planning and organization of labor. &nbsp;But, it also entailed an entirely new level of technical sophistication, specifically in the working of very hard stone. For instance, the horizontal lintel stones which topped the exterior ring of sarsen stones were fitted to them using a tongue and groove joint and then fitted to each other using a mortise and tenon joint, methods used in modern woodworking.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each of the upright sarsens were dressed differently on each side, with the inward facing side more smoothly finished than the outer. Moreover, the stones of the outer ring of sarsens were subtly modified to accommodate the way the human eye observes the massive stones against the bright shades of the Salisbury plain: upright stones were gently widened toward the top which makes their mass constant when viewed from the ground.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lintel stones also curve slightly to echo the circular outer henge. The stones in the horseshoe of trilithons are arranged by size; the smallest pair of trilithons are around 20 feet tall, the next pair a little higher and the largest, single trilithon in the south west corner would have been 24 feet tall. This effect creates a kind of pull inward to the monument, and dramatizes the outward Northeast facing of the horseshoe. Although there are many theories, it is still not known how or why these subtle refinements were made to Stonehenge, but their existence is sure proof of a sophisticated society with organized leadership and a lot of free time. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Solar and Lunar Calendar?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of course the most famous aspect of Stonehenge is its relationship with the solar and lunar calendar. This idea was first proposed by scholars in the 18th century, who noted that the sunrise of the midsummer solstice is exactly framed by the end of the horseshoe of trilithons at the interior of the monument, and exactly opposite that point, at the center of the bend of the horseshoe, at the midwinter sunset, the sun&nbsp;is also aligned. These dates, the longest and shortest days of the year, are the turning point of the two great seasonal episodes of the annual calendar. Since this discovery, several other theories about astrological observation have been offered but few stand up to scrutiny together with the physical details of the monument.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Stonehenge, on Salisbury plain in England, is one of the most recognizable monuments of the Neolithic world and one of the most popular, with over one million visitors a year. People come to see Stonehenge because it is so impossibly big and so impossibly old; some are searching for a connection with a prehistoric past; some come to witness the workings of a massive astrological observatory. The people living in the fourth millennium BC who began work on Stonehenge were contemporary with the first dynasties of Ancient Egypt, and their efforts predate the building of the Pyramids. What they created has endured millennia and still intrigues us today.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Phase One</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In fact, what we see today is the result of at least three phases of construction, although there is still a lot of controversy among archaeologists about exactly how and when these phases occurred. It is generally agreed that the first phase of construction at Stonehenge occurred around 3100 BCE, when a great circular ditch about six feet deep was dug with a bank of dirt within it about 360 feet in diameter, with a large entrance to the northeast and a smaller one to the south. This circular ditch and bank together is called a henge. &nbsp;Within the henge were dug 56 pits, each slightly more than three feet in diameter, called Aubrey holes, after John Aubrey, the 17th century English archaeologist who first found them. These holes, it is thought, were either originally filled with upright bluestones or upright wooden beams. If it was bluestones which filled the Aubrey holes, it involved quite a bit of effort as each weighed between 2 and 4 tons and were mined from the Preseli Hills, about 250 miles away in Wales.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Phase Two</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The second phase of work at Stonehenge occurred approximately 100-200 years later and involved the setting up of upright wooden posts, possibly of a roofed structure, in the center of the henge, as well as more upright posts near the northeast and southern entrances. Surprisingly, it is also during this second phase at Stonehenge that it was used for burial. At least 25 of the Aubrey holes were emptied and reused to hold cremation burials and another 30 cremation burial pits were dug into the ditch of the henge and in the eastern portion within the henge enclosure. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Phase Three</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The third phase of construction at Stonehenge happened approximately 400-500 years later and likely lasted a long time. In this phase the remaining blue stones or wooden beams which had been placed in the Aubrey holes were pulled and a circle 108 feet in diameter of 30 huge and very hard sarsen stones were erected within the henge; these were quarried from nearby Marlborough Downs. These upright sarsen stones were capped with 30 lintel stones.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Interior of the sarsen circle and bluestones in the foreground\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fdf653e0d32abceac9fcb05ab869c90eaab726a5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Interior of the sarsen circle and bluestones in the foreground</span></span>Each standing stone was around 13 feet high, almost seven feet wide and weighed around 25 tons. &nbsp;This ring of stones enclosed five sarsen trilithons (a trilithon is a pair of upright stones with a lintel stone spanning their tops) set up in a horseshoe shape 45 feet across. These huge stones, ten uprights and five lintels, weigh up to 50 tons each. Bluestones, either reinstalled or freshly quarried, were erected in a circle, half in the outer sarsen circle and half within the sarsen horseshoe. At the end of the phase there is some rearrangement of the bluestones as well as the construction of a long processional avenue, consisting of parallel banks with exterior ditches approximately 34 meters across, leading from the northeast entrance to Stonehenge, dipping to the south and eventually to the banks of the Avon river. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3> Perguntas </h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>All three phases of the construction of Stonehenge pose fascinating questions. The first phase of work required precise planning and a massive amount of labor. Who planned the henge and who organized whom to work together in its construction? &nbsp;Unfortunately, remains of Neolithic villages, which would provide information about who built Stonehenge, are few, possibly because so many lie underneath later Bronze Age, Roman, Medieval and modern cities. The few villages that have been explored show simple farming hamlets with very little evidence of widely differing social status. If there were leaders or a social class who convinced or forced people to work together to build the first phase of Stonehenge, we haven&rsquo;t found them. It also probably means the first phase of Stonehenge&rsquo;s construction was an egalitarian endeavor, highly unusual for the ancient world.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Who were the people buried at Stonehenge during&nbsp;its second phase? Recent analysis of these bones has revealed that nearly all the burials were of adult males, aged 25-40 years, in good health and with little sign of hard labor or disease. No doubt, to be interred at Stonehenge was a mark of elite status and these remains may well be those of some of the first political leaders of Great Britain, an island with a ruling tradition extending all the way to the House of Windsor. They also show us that in this era, some means of social distinction must have been desirable.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work achieved in the long third phase of Stonehenge&rsquo;s construction, however, is the one which is most remarkable and enduring. Like the first phase of Stonehenge, except on a much larger scale, the third phase involved tremendous planning and organization of labor. &nbsp;But, it also entailed an entirely new level of technical sophistication, specifically in the working of very hard stone. For instance, the horizontal lintel stones which topped the exterior ring of sarsen stones were fitted to them using a tongue and groove joint and then fitted to each other using a mortise and tenon joint, methods used in modern woodworking.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each of the upright sarsens were dressed differently on each side, with the inward facing side more smoothly finished than the outer. Moreover, the stones of the outer ring of sarsens were subtly modified to accommodate the way the human eye observes the massive stones against the bright shades of the Salisbury plain: upright stones were gently widened toward the top which makes their mass constant when viewed from the ground.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lintel stones also curve slightly to echo the circular outer henge. The stones in the horseshoe of trilithons are arranged by size; the smallest pair of trilithons are around 20 feet tall, the next pair a little higher and the largest, single trilithon in the south west corner would have been 24 feet tall. This effect creates a kind of pull inward to the monument, and dramatizes the outward Northeast facing of the horseshoe. Although there are many theories, it is still not known how or why these subtle refinements were made to Stonehenge, but their existence is sure proof of a sophisticated society with organized leadership and a lot of free time. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Solar and Lunar Calendar?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of course the most famous aspect of Stonehenge is its relationship with the solar and lunar calendar. This idea was first proposed by scholars in the 18th century, who noted that the sunrise of the midsummer solstice is exactly framed by the end of the horseshoe of trilithons at the interior of the monument, and exactly opposite that point, at the center of the bend of the horseshoe, at the midwinter sunset, the sun&nbsp;is also aligned. These dates, the longest and shortest days of the year, are the turning point of the two great seasonal episodes of the annual calendar. Since this discovery, several other theories about astrological observation have been offered but few stand up to scrutiny together with the physical details of the monument.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>Sir Francis Bacon</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>In 1620, around the time that people first began to look through microscopes, an English politician named Sir Francis Bacon developed a method for philosophers to use in weighing the truthfulness of knowledge. While Bacon agreed with medieval thinkers that humans too often erred in interpreting what their five senses perceived, he also realized that people&#39;s sensory experiences provided the best possible means of making sense of the world. Because humans could incorrectly interpret anything they saw, heard, smelled, tasted, or felt, Bacon insisted that they must doubt everything before assuming its truth.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Testing hypotheses</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In order to test potential truths, or hypotheses, Bacon devised a method whereby scientists set up experiments to manipulate nature, and attempt to prove their hypotheses wrong. For example, in order to test the idea that sickness came from external causes, Bacon argued that scientists should expose healthy people to outside influences such as coldness, wetness, or other sick people to discover if any of these external variables resulted in more people getting sick. Knowing that many different causes for sickness might be missed by humans who are unable or unwilling to perceive them, Bacon insisted that experiments must be consistently repeated before truth can be known: a scientist must show that patients exposed to a specific variable more frequently got sick again, and again, and again.</p>\n"

Bacon&#39;s philosophical work marks a very significant breakthrough for the study of the world around us, but it is important to stress that this method of investigation was not completed in a vacuum. Rather, Bacon&#39;s work should be seen as a part of a widespread cultural revolution accelerated by the rise of the printing press in the fifteenth century.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Importance of the printing press</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Advances in the ability to disseminate new ideas by making standardized letters, numbers, and diagrams repeatable allowed for an unprecedented level of cooperation among philosophers who could now build on each other&#39;s ideas over long periods of time. It would be difficult to overstate the effect of the print revolution. Astronomers such as Copernicus and Galileo began to share and build upon their experiments, and religious reformers began to publicize new (and increasingly radical) Protestant ideas. In a mutually beneficial relationship the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution encouraged philosophers to discover all they could about nature as a way to learn more about God, an undertaking that promoted a break with past authorities.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A direct engagement with nature</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Artisans and craftspeople soon began engaging in the new &quot;natural philosophy,&quot; exemplifying the fact that a monumental shift in what constituted evidence for truth was under way. Not only did renaissance artisans create lenses to see, tools to measure, and artworks to replicate the natural world, but by the sixteenth century, they began to publish philosophical treatises asserting that through the imitation and reproduction of nature in their arts, they were able to achieve a state of direct engagement with nature. Rather than taking knowledge from ancient sources, they argued that true knowledge came from direct experience. Alchemists likewise prioritized direct engagement with nature. In using fire to divide elements into their &quot;smallest&quot; components (and discovering that there were more than four of them), alchemists promoted the revolutionary idea that observation of nature itself, rather than reliance on ancient authorities, provided the best foundation for knowledge.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<p>During the Gothic period and the Renaissance (1100s&ndash;1500s) stained glass was one of the foremost techniques of painting practiced in Europe. It may seem surprising to call stained glass a form of painting, but in fact it is. Look closely at the image here and note that the surfaces of each piece of glass are painted in a wide range of dark tones. One of the most widespread forms of painting, stained glass inspired the lives of the faithful through religious narratives in churches and cloisters, celebrated family and political ties in city halls, and even decorated the windows of private houses.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Why is it called&nbsp;stained&nbsp;glass?</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The term stained glass derives from the silver stain that was often applied to the side of the window that would face the outside of the building.

"<p>During the Gothic period and the Renaissance (1100s&ndash;1500s) stained glass was one of the foremost techniques of painting practiced in Europe. It may seem surprising to call stained glass a form of painting, but in fact it is. Look closely at the image here and note that the surfaces of each piece of glass are painted in a wide range of dark tones. One of the most widespread forms of painting, stained glass inspired the lives of the faithful through religious narratives in churches and cloisters, celebrated family and political ties in city halls, and even decorated the windows of private houses.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Money. Possessions. Power.</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The same materialistic ideals which drive many men and women today have performed the same function throughout history. Those in positions of power often chose to commemorate their status through images. Some purchase works of art by famous artists to demonstrate their wealth, while others commission portraits of themselves as reminders of their prestige.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A young couple in the middle of the eighteenth century, Robert Andrews and Frances Andrews, opted for the second option to celebrate their marriage and subsequent combination of their families&#39; fortune. To depict their increased status, the Andrews&rsquo; commissioned a relatively unknown painter named Thomas Gainsborough to paint their portraits. Little could they anticipate that within a few decades it would be the artist, and not the subjects, that would make their portrait famous.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Conversation on Canvas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Gainsborough&rsquo;s portrait of the newly-married Robert and Frances Andrews is typical of the genre of &quot;conversation pieces;&quot; informal group portraits which gained popularity in the middle of the eighteenth century in England. Unlike the formal, straightforward portraits which characterized earlier periods and locations, the &quot;conversation piece&quot; usually presented a small group of individuals in an outdoor space, engaged in discussion and unaware of the viewer&rsquo;s presence. Mr. and Mrs. Andrews diverts from that tradition, as its sitters are clearly reacting to Gainsborough&rsquo;s presence, but their relaxed poses and location in the English countryside connects them to the &quot;conversation piece&quot; tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the time Gainsborough executed this painting, he was a 23-year-old emerging artist working in city of Ipswich in the rural English county of Suffolk. As a teenager he served an apprenticeship in London and also received instruction from Hubert-Fran&ccedil;ois Gravelot, a popular Rococo engraver working in England&rsquo;s capital city. In 1749 Gainsborough moved with his wife to Ipswich, 70 miles from London and just 20 miles from his birthplace of Sudbury, in Suffolk County. Robert Andrews and his future wife, then known as Frances Carter, also grew up in Sudbury, in much wealthier families. In his portrait of the pair, Gainsborough captures the barely-veiled disdain in Frances Andrews&rsquo; eyes and her wry smile.

"\n"
"<h3><span>Love of Landscape</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Following the &quot;conversation piece&quot; tradition, Gainsborough includes a landscape in his painting. However, he provides a much greater view of rural England than might be expected from such a work. Mr. and Mrs. Andrews pose on the left half of the canvas, rather than directly in the middle as was typical in a straightforward portrait. On the right side, Gainsborough gives equal attention to the grounds of The Auberies, the Andrews&rsquo; estate in Sudbury.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The couple is located on the edge of a field of wheat, and fenced in cattle populate the middle ground to the left while sheep graze to the right of the pair. Through the implementation of modern agricultural techniques and technology, Mr. Andrews has brought the land under his control. His pose is meant to suggest that his work is done and he can now relax and hunt with his dog, although he doesn&rsquo;t look very comfortable holding his rifle.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The attention Gainsborough lavishes on the rolling English countryside reflects his lifelong love for nature. Although he became famous as a portrait painter, Gainsborough insisted throughout his life that landscape painting was his true calling, and he considered himself a landscape painter rather than a portraitist. He spent most of his career outside of London, the center of the English art world. After leaving Ipswich a decade after painting Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, Gainsborough set up shop in the resort city of Bath, where his delicate and sensual portraits defined the Rococo fashion in England in the second half of the eighteenth century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Rococo in England</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Rococo was a French style, imported by foreign artists like Hubert-Fran&ccedil;ois Gravelot and by English collectors. In the early 1700s England did not have a strong painting tradition, and its most famous artists were international painters who traveled to London to take advantage of that fact. Gainsborough looked to the frivolous, playful paintings being commissioned by French aristocrats, and applied their delicate style to slightly more reserved and contained subjects.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Mrs. Andrews&rsquo; dress possesses the pastel colors and delicate lace of more erotic French works like Jean-Honor&eacute; Fragonard&rsquo;s The Swing. Her dress and Mr. Andrews&rsquo; shirt glimmer in sunlight, despite the overcast sky. Mrs. Andrews sits on a bench that is entirely too elaborate to sit exposed in the middle of a wheat field. Both figures are pale and lithe, reflecting the upper class privilege of not having to work for a living. Their expansive estate functions as an ostentatious demonstration of their wealth: it continues as far as the eye can see.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Although the Andrews purchased their conversation portrait from Gainsborough, something is missing from the work. Bare canvas surrounds Mrs. Andrews&#39; hands, folded in her lap. No one knows exactly what Gainsborough intended to paint in that space, if he intended to paint anything at all. Some scholars have suggested that Mrs. Andrews was meant to hold a dead game bird, the result of a successful hunting trip by her husband. Such an inclusion would emphasize the couple&rsquo;s control over their land, but a bloody animal would ruin Mrs. Andrews&rsquo; elaborate dress, and therefore seems unlikely.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Another possibility for Mrs. Andrews&rsquo; lap is that the blank space was intended for a baby. Regardless of what was meant to go in that spot, Gainsborough never added it in. Modern scholars consider the painting to be &ldquo;unfinished,&rdquo; but we&rsquo;ll never know what the original finished work was to look like, or if its current state was as &ldquo;finished&rdquo; as Gainsborough and the Andrews wanted.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Money. Possessions. Power.</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The same materialistic ideals which drive many men and women today have performed the same function throughout history. Those in positions of power often chose to commemorate their status through images. Some purchase works of art by famous artists to demonstrate their wealth, while others commission portraits of themselves as reminders of their prestige.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A young couple in the middle of the eighteenth century, Robert Andrews and Frances Andrews, opted for the second option to celebrate their marriage and subsequent combination of their families&#39; fortune. To depict their increased status, the Andrews&rsquo; commissioned a relatively unknown painter named Thomas Gainsborough to paint their portraits. Little could they anticipate that within a few decades it would be the artist, and not the subjects, that would make their portrait famous.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Conversation on Canvas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Gainsborough&rsquo;s portrait of the newly-married Robert and Frances Andrews is typical of the genre of &quot;conversation pieces;&quot; informal group portraits which gained popularity in the middle of the eighteenth century in England. Unlike the formal, straightforward portraits which characterized earlier periods and locations, the &quot;conversation piece&quot; usually presented a small group of individuals in an outdoor space, engaged in discussion and unaware of the viewer&rsquo;s presence. Sr. and Mrs. Andrews diverts from that tradition, as its sitters are clearly reacting to Gainsborough&rsquo;s presence, but their relaxed poses and location in the English countryside connects them to the &quot;conversation piece&quot; tradition.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the time Gainsborough executed this painting, he was a 23-year-old emerging artist working in city of Ipswich in the rural English county of Suffolk. As a teenager he served an apprenticeship in London and also received instruction from Hubert-Fran&ccedil;ois Gravelot, a popular Rococo engraver working in England&rsquo;s capital city. In 1749 Gainsborough moved with his wife to Ipswich, 70 miles from London and just 20 miles from his birthplace of Sudbury, in Suffolk County. Robert Andrews and his future wife, then known as Frances Carter, also grew up in Sudbury, in much wealthier families. In his portrait of the pair, Gainsborough captures the barely-veiled disdain in Frances Andrews&rsquo; eyes and her wry smile. She and her husband are well aware that the portraitist, whom they would have known since childhood, is well below them on the social ladder.</p>\n"

"<p>While there is no one text or creed that forms the basis of all Hindu beliefs, several texts are considered fundamental to all branches of Hinduism. These texts are generally divided into two main groups: eternal, revealed texts, and those based upon what humanity has learned and written down. The Vedas are an example of the former, while the two great epics, the <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em>, belong to the latter category. For centuries, texts were transmitted orally, and the priestly caste, or brahmans, was entrusted with memorization and preservation of sacred texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Vedas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Vedas are India&rsquo;s earliest surviving texts, dating from approximately 2000 to 1500 B.C.E. These texts are made up of hymns and ritual treatises that are instructional in nature, along with other sections that are more speculative and metaphysical. The Vedas are greatly revered by contemporary Hindus as forming the foundation for their deepest beliefs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The early Vedas refer often to certain gods such as Indra, the thunder god, and Agni, who carries messages between humans and the gods through fire sacrifices. Some of these gods persist in later Hinduism, while others are diminished or transformed into other deities over time. The Vedas are considered a timeless revelation, and a source of unchanging knowledge that underlies much of present-day Hindu practices.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These two great epics are the most widely known works in India. Every child becomes familiar with these stories from an early age. The <em>Mahabharata</em> is the world&rsquo;s longest poem, with approximately 100,000 verses. It tells the story of the conflict between the Pandava brothers and their cousins the Kauravas, a rivalry that culminates in a great battle. On the eve of the battle, the Pandava warrior Arjuna is distressed by what will happen. The god Krishna consoles him in a famous passage known as the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> (meaning &ldquo;the Song of the Lord&rdquo;). This section of the <em>Mahabharata</em> has become a standard reference in addressing the duty of the individual, the importance of dharma, and humankind&rsquo;s relationship to God and society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A second epic, the <em>Ramayana</em>, contains some of India&rsquo;s best-loved characters, including Rama and Sita, the ideal royal couple, and their helper, the monkey leader, Hanuman. Rama is an incarnation of the God Vishnu. The story tells of Rama and Sita&rsquo;s withdrawal to the forest after being exiled from the kingdom of Ayodhya. Sita is abducted in the forest by Ravana, the evil king of Lanka. Rama eventually defeats Ravana, with the help of his brother and an army of monkeys and bears. The couple returns to Ayodhya and are crowned, and from that point the story has evolved to acquire different endings. Episodes of the Ramayana are frequently illustrated in Hindu art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Puranas</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Puranas are the primary source of stories about the Hindu deities. They were probably assembled between 300 to 1000 C.E., and their presence corresponds to the rise of Hinduism and the growing importance of certain deities. They describe the exploits of the gods as well as various devotional practices associated with them. Some of the Vedic gods&mdash;Indra, Agni, Surya&mdash;reappear in the Puranas, but figure less importantly in the stories than do Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, the various manifestations of the Goddess, and other celestial figures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Tantras</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Around the same time as the recording of the Puranas, a number of texts concerning ritual practices surrounding various deities emerge. They are collectively known as Tantras or Agamas, and refer to religious observances, yoga, behavior, and the proper selection and design of temple sites. Some aspects of the Tantras concern the harnessing of physical energies as a means to achieve spiritual breakthrough. Tantric practices cross religious boundaries, and manifest themselves in aspects of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.</p>\n"

"<p>An early example of a &ldquo;daguerreotype.&rdquo;<em> Paris Boulevard</em> is a significant step in the development of photography.

"<h3>Victorian London</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1dc6789efd4a7fda6f5296be965b74b09eca6d2c.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ford Madox Brown, detail <em>Work</em>, 1852-65, oil on canvas, 137 x 197.3 cm (Manchester City Art Galleries)</span></span>Construction projects have always been a part of city life, and Victorian London was no exception. Ford Madox Brown&rsquo;s painting <em>Work </em>is a fascinating glimpse of just this. Our eye is immediately drawn to the young man in a striped hat effortlessly lifting a shovel high in the air, and the well-muscled forearms of the other workers.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Our eye then moves through the large canvas to the other figures, some more finely dressed and obviously of a different social class than the workers. But it is clear that <em>Work </em>is about more than just men digging. While the painting might appear to be a random view of a street, it is a carefully composed snapshot of the new way that different classes and professions encountered one another on the streets of Victorian London</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Brown and the Pre-Raphaelites</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ford Madox Brown is associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of British artists noted for their attention to detail, vibrant colors, and interest in scenes from literature. Although Brown himself was never an official member of the PRB, he was friendly with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others in the group. The two got to know each other when Rossetti appeared on Brown&rsquo;s doorstep in 1848 asking for art lessons. Although the lessons were short-lived, the two developed a lasting friendship. Through his association with the PRB, Brown adopted many of their stylistic tendencies, particularly the use of bright colors and attention to detail.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Modern Life</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, Brown&rsquo;s paintings show a much greater interest in subjects of modern life than many of the other artists associated with the PRB. Brown recalled that he got the idea for <em>Work </em>from seeing navvies, or construction workers, excavating sewers in Hampstead, North London. The painting was begun in the summer of 1852. Brown traveled to the same spot in Hampstead every day, transporting his canvas back and forth by means of a special cart. The background landscape of the painting was completed right on the street in Hampstead so that Brown could capture the precise details of light, color and form. This interest in direct observation and specificity were hallmarks of the Pre-Raphaelite style.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>VIctorian ideas of class</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting centers on a group of working-class navvies. These figures represent the noble &ldquo;working man,&rdquo; as they are neatly dressed and diligently going about their tasks. In contrast to the workers, there is a group of ragged children in the foreground, representing the lowest of the lower classes. In the catalogue of his 1865 one-man exhibition, Brown tells us that the children&rsquo;s mother is dead, and that the oldest, a girl of ten, is in charge of the rest of the children. She wears a tattered dress and is holding an infant over one shoulder.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Also representative of the lowest class is the ragged and barefoot plant seller on the left side, a figure whom Brown described as a &ldquo;ragged wretch who has never been taught to work.&rdquo; This hunched figure represents a stark contrast to the industrious and athletic navvies. shoveling away. Both the workers and the ragged children form another contrast, this time to the upper class figures depicted in the painting. On the left hand side, two ladies skirt the edge of the picture. The first, lady carrying a parasol, is a portrait of the artist&rsquo;s Brown&rsquo;s wife Emma. Following along behind is another well-dressed woman who offers a religious tract to one of the navvies. Seeing to the religious education of the lower classes was a type of &ldquo;work&rdquo; engaged in by many evangelical middle-class women.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Victorian London</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1dc6789efd4a7fda6f5296be965b74b09eca6d2c.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Ford Madox Brown, detail <em>Work</em>, 1852-65, oil on canvas, 137 x 197.3 cm (Manchester City Art Galleries)</span></span>Construction projects have always been a part of city life, and Victorian London was no exception. Ford Madox Brown&rsquo;s painting <em>Work </em>is a fascinating glimpse of just this. Our eye is immediately drawn to the young man in a striped hat effortlessly lifting a shovel high in the air, and the well-muscled forearms of the other workers.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Our eye then moves through the large canvas to the other figures, some more finely dressed and obviously of a different social class than the workers. But it is clear that <em>Work </em>is about more than just men digging. While the painting might appear to be a random view of a street, it is a carefully composed snapshot of the new way that different classes and professions encountered one another on the streets of Victorian London</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Brown and the Pre-Raphaelites</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ford Madox Brown is associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of British artists noted for their attention to detail, vibrant colors, and interest in scenes from literature. Although Brown himself was never an official member of the PRB, he was friendly with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others in the group. The two got to know each other when Rossetti appeared on Brown&rsquo;s doorstep in 1848 asking for art lessons. Although the lessons were short-lived, the two developed a lasting friendship. Through his association with the PRB, Brown adopted many of their stylistic tendencies, particularly the use of bright colors and attention to detail.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Modern Life</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, Brown&rsquo;s paintings show a much greater interest in subjects of modern life than many of the other artists associated with the PRB. Brown recalled that he got the idea for <em>Work </em>from seeing navvies, or construction workers, excavating sewers in Hampstead, North London. The painting was begun in the summer of 1852. Brown traveled to the same spot in Hampstead every day, transporting his canvas back and forth by means of a special cart. The background landscape of the painting was completed on right on the street in Hampstead because so that Brown could capture the precise details of light, color and form. This interest in direct observation and specificity were hallmarks of the Pre-Raphaelite style.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>VIctorian ideas of class</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting centers on a group of working-class navvies. These figures represent the noble &ldquo;working man,&rdquo; as they are neatly dressed and diligently going about their tasks. In contrast to the workers, there is a group of ragged children in the foreground, representing the lowest of the lower classes. In the catalogue of his 1865 one-man exhibition, Brown tells us that the children&rsquo;s mother is dead, and that the oldest, a girl of ten, is in charge of the rest of the children. She wears a tattered dress and is holding an infant over one shoulder.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Also representative of the lowest class is the ragged and barefoot plant seller on the left side, a figure whom Brown described as a &ldquo;ragged wretch who has never been taught to work.&rdquo; This hunched figure represents a stark contrast to the industrious and athletic navvies. shoveling away. Both the workers and the ragged children form another contrast, this time to the upper class figures depicted in the painting. On the left hand side, two ladies skirt the edge of the picture. The first, lady carrying a parasol, is a portrait of the artist&rsquo;s Brown&rsquo;s wife Emma. Following along behind is another well-dressed woman who offers a religious tract to one of the navvies. Seeing to the religious education of the lower classes was a type of &ldquo;work&rdquo; engaged in by many evangelical middle-class women.&nbsp;</p>\n"

These class distinctions are even carried over into the pets in the foreground of the painting.

Taken from the play <em>Measure for Measure</em>, which tells the story of Claudio, who has been sentenced to death by Lord Angelo (the temporary ruler of Vienna) for impregnating his fianc&eacute;e. Claudio&rsquo;s sister Isabella, a nun, goes to Angelo to plead for clemency for her brother and is shocked that he suggests that she trade sex for her brother&rsquo;s life. Of course, she refuses, and Claudio initially agrees with her decision, but later changes his mind. Hunt depicts the moment when the imprisoned Claudio suggests that Isabella sacrifice her virginity to gain his freedom. It was the type of subject that appealed to Hunt, who liked themes to do with questions of guilt and sinful behavior, such as his well known painting <em>The Awakening Conscience</em> (1853).</p>\n"

"<h3>Claudio and Isabella</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Claudio&rsquo;s face, which is partly in shadow, looks down and away from his sister. His slouching posture, the rich texture of his dark, yet colorful clothes and pointed medieval-looking shoes are a sharp contrast to the stark white of the nun&rsquo;s habit, her upright posture and unwavering gaze.

"<h3>Financial difficulties&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><em>Claudio and Isabella</em> was begun in 1850 after Hunt received a small advance from the painter Augustus Egg.

"\n"
"<h3>Uruk</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Prehistory ends with Uruk, where we find some of the earliest written records. This large city-state (and it environs) was largely dedicated to agriculture and eventually dominated southern Mesopotamia. Uruk perfected Mesopotamian irrigation and administration systems.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An agricultural theocracy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Within the city of Uruk, there was a large temple complex dedicated to Innana, the patron goddess of the city. The City-State&#39;s agricultural production would be &ldquo;given&rdquo; to her and stored at her temple. Harvested crops would then be processed (grain ground into flour, barley fermented into beer) &nbsp;and given back to the citizens of Uruk in equal share at regular intervals.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The head of the temple administration, the chief priest of Innana, also served as political leader, making Uruk the first known theocracy.&nbsp;We know many details about this theocratic administration because the Sumerians left numerous documents in the form of tablets written in&nbsp;cuneiform script.&nbsp;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/feb1e8131ce334a14936a5c8052990a5dc2df8fd.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Cuneiform tablet&nbsp;still in its clay case: legal case from Niqmepuh, King of Iamhad (Aleppo), 1720 B.C.E., 3.94 x 2&quot; (British Museum</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is almost impossible to imagine a time before writing. However, you might be disappointed to learn that writing was not invented to record stories, poetry, or prayers to a god. The first fully developed written script, cuneiform, was invented to account for something unglamorous, but very important&mdash;surplus commodities: bushels of barley, head of cattle, and jars of oil!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The origin of written language (c. 3200 B.C.E.) was born out of economic necessity and was a tool of the theocratic (priestly) ruling elite who needed to keep track of the agricultural wealth of the city-states. The last known document written in the cuneiform script dates to the first century B.C.E. Only the hieroglyphic script of the Ancient Egyptians lasted longer.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A reed and clay tablet</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A single reed, cleanly cut from the banks of the Euphrates or Tigris river, when pressed cut-edge down into a soft clay tablet, will make a wedge shape. The arrangement of multiple wedge shapes (as few as two and as many as ten) created cuneiform characters. Characters could be written either horizontally or vertically, although a horizontal arrangement was more widely used.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Very few cuneiform signs have only one meaning; most have as many as four. Cuneiform signs could represent a whole word or an idea or a number. Most frequently though, they represented a syllable. A cuneiform syllable could be a vowel alone, a consonant plus a vowel, a vowel plus a consonant and even a consonant plus a vowel plus a consonant. There isn&rsquo;t a sound that a human mouth can make that this script can&rsquo;t record.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Probably because of this extraordinary flexibility, the range of languages that were written with cuneiform across history of the Ancient Near East is vast and includes Sumerian, Akkadian, Amorite, Hurrian, Urartian, Hittite, Luwian, Palaic, Hatian and Elamite.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Prehistory ends with Uruk, where we find some of the earliest written records. This large city-state (and it environs) was largely dedicated to agriculture and eventually dominated southern Mesopotamia. Uruk perfected Mesopotamian irrigation and administration systems.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An Agricultural Theocracy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Within the city of Uruk, there was a large temple complex dedicated to Innana, the patron goddess of the city. The City-State&#39;s agricultural production would be &ldquo;given&rdquo; to her and stored at her temple. Harvested crops would then be processed (grain ground into flour, barley fermented into beer) &nbsp;and given back to the citizens of Uruk in equal share at regular intervals.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The head of the temple administration, the chief priest of Innana, also served as political leader, making Uruk the first known theocracy.&nbsp;We know many details about this theocratic administration because the Sumerians left numerous documents in the form of tablets written in&nbsp;cuneiform script.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>It is almost impossible to imagine a time before writing. However, you might be disappointed to learn that writing was not invented to record stories, poetry, or prayers to a god. The first fully developed written script, cuneiform, was invented to account for something unglamorous, but very important&mdash;surplus commodities: bushels of barley, head of cattle, and jars of oil!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The origin of written language (c. 3200 B.C.E.) was born out of economic necessity and was a tool of the theocratic (priestly) ruling elite who needed to keep track of the agricultural wealth of the city-states. The last known document written in the cuneiform script dates to the first century B.C.E. Only the hieroglyphic script of the Ancient Egyptians lasted longer.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A Reed and Clay Tablet</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A single reed, cleanly cut from the banks of the Euphrates or Tigris river, when pressed cut-edge down into a soft clay tablet, will make a wedge shape. The arrangement of multiple wedge shapes (as few as two and as many as ten) created cuneiform characters. Characters could be written either horizontally or vertically, although a horizontal arrangement was more widely used.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Very few cuneiform signs have only one meaning; most have as many as four. Cuneiform signs could represent a whole word or an idea or a number. Most frequently though, they represented a syllable. A cuneiform syllable could be a vowel alone, a consonant plus a vowel, a vowel plus a consonant and even a consonant plus a vowel plus a consonant. There isn&rsquo;t a sound that a human mouth can make that this script can&rsquo;t record.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Probably because of this extraordinary flexibility, the range of languages that were written with cuneiform across history of the Ancient Near East is vast and includes Sumerian, Akkadian, Amorite, Hurrian, Urartian, Hittite, Luwian, Palaic, Hatian and Elamite.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Cult of domesticity</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the mid-nineteenth century, many people were troubled by the effects that the Industrial Revolution was having on the environment, society at large, and workers employed in factories, concerns that are echoed in today&rsquo;s environmental movement. &nbsp;The English art critic John Ruskin&nbsp;argued that the inexpensive, factory-made goods flooding the markets had a negative effect on both those who made them and those who consumed them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ruskin and others believed that mechanized factory production deprived workers of the personal satisfaction and creativity involved in designing and making an object entirely with one&rsquo;s own hands. &nbsp;They also believed that people who bought these goods were surrounding themselves with soulless objects that lacked aesthetic value.&nbsp;Thus, their domestic environments were missing the elements of spirituality and refinement that produce healthy, well-rounded citizens. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This was a particular concern in the age of the Victorian &ldquo;cult of domesticity,&rdquo; which emphasized the home as a morally uplifting respite from the negative influences of city life. &nbsp;Ruskin and his followers advocated a return to the medieval guild model in which artisans were responsible for handcrafting their works from beginning to end. This&nbsp;produced&nbsp;a sense of pride in the worker and guaranteed&nbsp;quality products for the consumer. &nbsp;William Morris was strongly influenced by Ruskin&rsquo;s writing and also dedicated to social reform.</p>\n"

"<h3>Craftsmanship and&nbsp;community</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Red House was the home he designed in Bexleyheath, a southeastern suburb of London, England, &nbsp;for his family with the assistance of Philip Webb. Webb and Morris met while working in London for the architect G. E. Street. &nbsp;Webb would go on to be one of the major architects of the Gothic Revival movement in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris wanted the house to be a place that reflected his ideals and celebrated art, craftsmanship, and community. &nbsp;Morris and Webb collaborated to make the house&rsquo;s architecture and interior design merge into a unified whole. This&nbsp;would provide the appropriate atmosphere to foster domestic harmony and instill creative energy in its inhabitants and visitors. &nbsp;It was the first home built according to the principles of fine artistry and utility that became the hallmark of the design firm Morris founded with Webb in 1861, as well as the emerging Arts and Crafts movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Morris and Webb designed the house in a simplified Tudor Gothic style. The features of this style include&nbsp;historicizing elements such as steep roofs, prominent chimneys, cross gables, and exposed-beam ceilings, all&nbsp;present in Red House. &nbsp;Morris was influenced by Ruskin and other theorists who saw the Gothic as a time of perfection in the craft and building trades, as well as a period of great faith and belief in human dignity. &nbsp;They also viewed the Gothic as a more suitable style for&nbsp;Northern Europe because it&nbsp;originated in France, a northern country, as opposed to the classical forms of ancient Greece and Rome. &nbsp;For Morris and Webb, the adoption of a specifically English form of Gothic architecture seemed natural and appropriate to the site.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The concept of an integral whole extended to the interior design as well.&nbsp;Webb, Morris, his wife, Jane, and the painter Edward Burne-Jones all worked together to design everything in the home, from the wallpaper to the stained-glass windows to the built-in cabinets and furniture, so that all celebrated the beauty of nature and the medieval guild ideal.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Some find it stiff and lifeless, proof of David&rsquo;s ineptness at capturing movement. Some see it not as art, but propaganda, pure and simple. Some snigger at its overblown, action-packed, cliff-hanging momentousness, with shades of &ldquo;Hi ho Silver, away!&rdquo; Some have it down as a sort of beginning of the end moment in David&rsquo;s career, before he officially became Napoleon&rsquo;s artist-lackey. Whatever one might say, though (and a lot has been said about <em>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</em>), it is still arguably the most successful portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte that was ever made. Personally, I love it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Background</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Completed in four months, from October 1800 to January 1801, it signals the dawning of a new century. After a decade of terror and uncertainty following the Revolution, France was emerging as a great power once more. At the heart of this revival, of course, was General Napoleon Bonaparte who, in 1799, had staged an uprising against the revolutionary government (a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat), installed himself as First Consul, and effectively become the most powerful man in France (a few years later he will declare himself emperor).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In May 1800 he led his troops across the Alps in a military campaign against the Austrians which ended in their defeat in June at the Battle of Marengo. It is this achievement the painting commemorates. The portrait was commissioned by Charles IV, then King of Spain, &nbsp;to be hung in a gallery of paintings of other great military leaders housed in the Royal Palace in Madrid.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Napoleon and the Portrait</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Famously, Napoleon offered David little support in executing the painting. Refusing to sit for it, he argued that: &ldquo;Nobody knows if the portraits of the great men resemble them, it is enough that their genius lives there.&rdquo; All David had to work from was an earlier portrait and the uniform Napoleon had worn at Marengo. One of David&rsquo;s sons stood in for him, dressed up in the uniform and perched on top of a ladder. This probably accounts for the youthful physique of the figure.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Napoleon, however, was not entirely divorced from the process. He was the one who settled on the idea of an equestrian portrait: &ldquo;calme sur un cheval fougueux&rdquo; (calm on a fiery horse), were his instructions to the artist. And David duly obliged. What better way, after all, to demonstrate Napoleon&#39;s ability to to wield power with sound judgment and composure. The fact that Napoleon did not actually lead his troops over the Alps but followed a couple of days after them, travelling on a narrow path on the back of a mule is not the point!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Description</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many equestrian portraits, a genre favoured by royalty, <em>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</em> is a portrait of authority. Napoleon is pictured astride a rearing Arabian stallion. Before him to his left we see a mountain, while in the background, largely obscured by rocks, French troops haul along a large canon and further down the line fly the tricolore (the national flag of France) .&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Some find it stiff and lifeless, proof of David&rsquo;s ineptness at capturing movement. Some see it not as art, but propaganda, pure and simple. Some snigger at its overblown, action-packed, cliff-hanging momentousness, with shades of &ldquo;Hi ho Silver, away!&rdquo; Some have it down as a sort of beginning of the end moment in David&rsquo;s career, before he officially became Napoleon&rsquo;s artist-lackey. Whatever one might say, though (and a lot has been said about <em>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</em>), it is still arguably the most successful portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte that was ever made. Personally, I love it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Experiência</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Completed in four months, from October 1800 to January 1801, it signals the dawning of a new century. After a decade of terror and uncertainty following the Revolution, France was emerging as a great power once more. At the heart of this revival, of course, was General Napoleon Bonaparte who, in 1799, had staged a an uprising against the revolutionary government (a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat), installed himself as First Consul, and effectively become the most powerful man in France (a few years later he will declare himself emporer).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In May 1800 he led his troops across the Alps in a military campaign against the Austrians which ended in their defeat in June at the Battle of Marengo. It is this achievement the painting commemorates. The portrait was commissioned by Charles IV, then King of Spain, &nbsp;to be hung in a gallery of paintings of other great military leaders housed in the Royal Palace in Madrid.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Napoleon and the Portrait</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Famously, Napoleon offered David little support in executing the painting. Refusing to sit for it, he argued that: &ldquo;Nobody knows if the portraits of the great men resemble them, it is enough that their genius lives there.&rdquo; All David had to work from was an earlier portrait and the uniform Napoleon had worn at Marengo. One of David&rsquo;s sons stood in for him, dressed up in the uniform and perched on top of a ladder. This probably accounts for the youthful physique of the figure.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Napoleon, however, was not entirely divorced from the process. He was the one who settled on the idea of an equestrian portrait: &ldquo;calme sur un cheval forgueux&rdquo; (calm on a fiery horse), were his instructions to the artist. And David duly obliged. What better way, after all, to demonstrate Napoleon&#39;s ability to to wield power with sound judgment and composure. The fact that Napoleon did not actually lead his troops over the Alps but followed a couple of days after them, travelling on a narrow path on the back of a mule is not the point!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Description</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many equestrian portraits, a genre favoured by royalty, <em>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</em> is a portrait of authority. Napoleon is pictured astride a rearing Arabian stallion. Before him to his left we see a mountain, while in the background, largely obscured by rocks, French troops haul along a large canon and further down the line fly the tricolore (the national flag of France) .&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Apart from the salon</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The group of artists who became known as the Impressionists did something ground-breaking&nbsp;in addition to painting&nbsp;their sketchy, light-filled canvases: they established their own exhibition. This may not seem like much in an era like ours, when art galleries are everywhere in major cities, but in Paris at this time, there was&nbsp;one official,&nbsp;state-sponsored&nbsp;exhibition&mdash;called the Salon&mdash;and very few art galleries devoted to&nbsp;the work of living artists. For most of the nineteenth century then,&nbsp;the Salon was the only way to exhibit your work (and therefore the only way to establish your reptutation and&nbsp;make a living as an artist). The works exhibited at the Salon were chosen by a jury&mdash;which could often be quite arbitrary. The artists we know today as Impressionists&mdash;Claude Monet,&nbsp;August Renoir,&nbsp;Edgar Degas,&nbsp;Berthe Morisot, Alfred Sisley (and several others)&mdash;could not afford to wait for France to accept their work. They all had experienced rejection by the Salon jury in recent years and felt that waiting an entire year between exhibitions wastoo long. They needed to show their work and they wanted to sell it.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Lack of finish</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Monet, Renoir, Degas, and Sisley had met through classes.

She had been accepted to the Salon, but her work had become more experimental since then. Degas invited Morisot to join their risky effort. The first exhibition did not repay the artists&nbsp;monetarily but it did draw the critics, some of whom decided their art was abominable. What they saw wasn&rsquo;t finished in their eyes; these were mere &quot;impressions.&quot; This was not a compliment.</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>The paintings of Neoclassical and Romantic artists had a finished appearance. The Impressionists&#39;&nbsp;&nbsp;completed works looked like sketches,&nbsp;fast and&nbsp;preliminary &ldquo;impressions&rdquo; that artists would dash off to preserve an idea of what to paint more carefully at a&nbsp;later date. Normally, an artist&rsquo;s &ldquo;impressions&rdquo; were not meant to be sold, but were meant to be aids for the memory&mdash;to take these ideas back to the studio for the masterpiece on canvas. The critics thought it was absurd to sell paintings that looked like slap-dash impressions and to present these paintings as&nbsp;finished works.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Landscape and contemporary life&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Courbet, Manet and the Impressionists also challenged the Academy&rsquo;s category codes. The Academy deemed that only &ldquo;history painting&rdquo; was great painting. These young Realists and Impressionists questioned the long establiished hierarchy of subject matter. They believed that landscapes and genres scenes (scenes of contemporary life)&nbsp;were worthy and important.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e5ae23e96121dc7cfd8c0d35fbef5f6922ae777e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Claude Monet, <em>Coquelicots, La promenade</em> (<em>Poppies</em>), 1873, 50 x 65 cm&nbsp;(Mus&eacute;e d&#39;Orsay, Paris)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Light and color</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In their landscapes and genre scenes, the Impressionist&nbsp;tried to arrest a particular moment in time by pinpointing specific atmospheric conditions&mdash;light flickering on water, moving clouds, a burst of rain. Their technique tried to capture what they saw. They painted small commas of pure color one next to another. When viewer stood&nbsp;at a reasonable distance their eyes would see a mix of individual marks;&nbsp;colors that had&nbsp;blended&nbsp;optically. This method created more vibrant colors than colors mixed as physical paint on a palette.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f5f6d7cd4dec3e37a278d12e9b7574a811e5c5c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Claude Monet, <em>La Gare Saint-Lazare</em>, 1877, oil on canvas, 75 x 104 cm&nbsp;(Mus&eacute;e d&#39;Orsay, Paris)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>An important aspect of the Impressionist painting was the appearance of quickly shifting light on the surface of forms and&nbsp;the representation&nbsp;changing atmospheric conditions. The Impressionists&nbsp;wanted to create an art that was modern by capturing the rapid pace of contemporary life&nbsp;and the fleeting conditions of light.&nbsp;They painted outdoors (<em>en plein air</em>) to capture the appearance of the light as it&nbsp;flickered and faded while they worked.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Reception</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the 1880s, the Impressionists accepted the name the critics gave them, though their reception in France did not improve quickly. Other artists, such as Mary Cassatt, recognized the value of the Impressionist movement and were invited to join.<span>&nbsp;American&nbsp;and other non-French collectors purchased numerous works by the Impressionists. Today, a large share of Impressionist work remains outside French collections.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<p>Courbet, Manet and the Impressionists also challenged the Academy&rsquo;s category codes. The Academy deemed that only &ldquo;history painting&rdquo; was great painting. These young Realists and Impressionists questioned the long establiished hierarchy of subject matter. They believed that landscapes and genres scenes (scenes of contemporary life)&nbsp;were worthy and important.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Light and color</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In their landscapes and genre scenes, the Impressionist&nbsp;tried to arrest a particular moment in time by pinpointing specific atmospheric conditions&mdash;light flickering on water, moving clouds, a burst of rain. Their technique tried to capture what they saw. They painted small commas of pure color one next to another. When viewer stood&nbsp;at a reasonable distance their eyes would see a mix of individual marks;&nbsp;colors that had&nbsp;blended&nbsp;optically. This method created more vibrant colors than colors mixed as physical paint on a palette.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>An important aspect of the Impressionist painting was the appearance of quickly shifting light on the surface of forms and&nbsp;the representation&nbsp;changing atmospheric conditions. The Impressionists&nbsp;wanted to create an art that was modern by capturing the rapid pace of contemporary life&nbsp;and the fleeting conditions of light.&nbsp;They painted outdoors (<em>en plein air</em>) to capture the appearance of the light as it&nbsp;flickered and faded while they worked.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Reception</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the 1880s, the Impressionists accepted the name the critics gave them, though their reception in France did not improve quickly. Other artists, such as Mary Cassatt, recognized the value of the Impressionist movement and were invited to join.<span>&nbsp;American&nbsp;and other non-French collectors purchased numerous works by the Impressionists. Today, a large share of Impressionist work remains outside French collections.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<p>Even as we see the three zones of space in relation to each other, the painting seems oddly flat, as if the sky were pulled forward and the foreground were pushed back. Of course we still see the illusion, but even as we see the space that C&eacute;zanne&#39;s line insists upon, the painting looks too much like three flat planes resting atop each other and the painting begins to remind us that it is, in fact, a vertical curtain.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>There are two means by which C&eacute;zanne has sabotaged the space of this canvas (unfortunately the effect is muted in reproduction and even more so on the computer screen--so trust me on this).

The movements of the brush get broader and more generalized as space moves back.

Have you noticed that in the middle of the sky, just to the left of the church steeple and the tree, there is a small smudge of brown paint. It is the same ocher used to render the shadows in the road and on the roofs. What is this?&nbsp;Have you ever seen a dense brown smudge just floating in the sky? I don&#39;t think so.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Mistakes on purpose</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>So what are we as the viewer to make of it? Is it a mistake? Was C&eacute;zanne a dottering old man by 1898, who accidently hit the canvas as his arms flailed about and then was too lazy to wipe it out and repaint that section? No. So what is it then? Well, when you look at the ochre smudge, what happens to the deep space of the sky? Do you notice how the ochre smudge refuses to sit back in deep space but instead pushes forward toward the middle plane of the houses?&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>When seen in person, the brown paint that hangs in the sky actually brings the sky with it, denying the illusion of deep space entirely. Also, note the bright sky blues in the foreground bushes. Just as the ochre spot in the sky forces the sky forward, so the clear blues that oddly appear within the viewer&#39;s reach, punch holes in the solidity of the foreground. The brown in the back pushes forward and the blue in the front pushes back. The result is a flattening of space or perhaps a more honest expression of the true flatness of the canvas.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Background</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Place de la Madeleine had been consecrated as a site devoted to Mary Magdalene in 1182. During the period known as the First Republic (1792-1804), following the French Revolution, the foundations of earlier sacred buildings were removed and discussions were had as to what to do with the space. As France had been de-Christianized during the Revolution a civic rather than a religious function for the building was decided upon; various suggestions were put forward including a new site for the Bank of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Considerations were brought to a halt, however, when in 1804 Napoleon crowned himself Emperor. What followed was one of the most ambitious propaganda programs of the nineteenth century. As well as looting works from the world&rsquo;s finest collections to display in the newly refurbished Louvre, renamed the Mus&eacute;e Napoleon, some of the greatest artists and sculptors of the age were recruited to exalt the new emperor. It was only fitting that Napoleon would turn to architects, too, to realize his vision of an imperial capital city. Three monuments of particular note were constructed with this end in view: the Arc de Triomphe, the Vend&ocirc;me Column and the church at the Place de la Madeleine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It was never Napoleon&rsquo;s intention to build a church for Mary Magdalene, though. For him the new building would stand as a Temple to the Glory of the Army, and by that, of course, he meant his own imperial army, that well-organized band of marauders who, having defeated the Austrians in the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, had managed to supplicate a great swathe of Europe. To celebrate their achievement, a competition to select the best design for the Temple was established in 1806 to be judged by to a jury selected from the Imperial Academy. As it turned out, the jury proved academic in more ways than one, their opinions counting for little as, despite their disapproval, Napoleon opted for the designs of one Pierre-Alexandre Vignon (1763-1828).&nbsp;</p>\n"

Lacking Ledoux&rsquo;s more visionary character, however, Vignon&rsquo;s design for the exterior was basically a scaled up version of the&nbsp;<em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;in N&icirc;mes.</p>\n"

These fluted Roman Corinthian columns &ndash; there are fifty-two of them in all &ndash; rise up to a staggering twenty meters and encompass the entire structure. The entablature they support is embellished with a bipartite architrave surmounted by a frieze with a decoration of garlands and putti.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb76385af927a4fd7fdf431c08373c85d136c113.gif\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Entablature (detail), <em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;c. 16 B.C.E (N&icirc;mes, Provence)</span></span>While not quite so ornate, the features, in the main, reproduce those found on the Roman temple. The dentils, those repeated teeth-like blocks that ornament the cornice, seem bulkier, however, lending the fa&ccedil;ade a somewhat more austere character.&nbsp;While the exterior bears the hallmarks of Napoleonic propaganda, evoking the grandeur of Imperial Rome, after his fall, the Bourbon Restoration (1814-30) sought to revive the relationship between church and state.&nbsp;For this reason it was decided, as the temple was still incomplete, to return to the pre-Revolution purpose of the building project, namely to construct a church dedicated to Mary Magdalene.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Pediment Frieze</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In contrast to the Napoleonic design of the temple, the pediment frieze, designed by Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire in 1829, is a masterpiece of Bourbon Restoration propaganda. The subject is&nbsp;<em>The Last Judgment</em>, a centuries-old motif found on relief sculptures above the doors of countless churches and cathedrals. While Lemaire largely follows iconographical convention, depicting Christ the Judge at the center of the composition and on His right the archangel Gabriel with his horn announcing the Day of Judgment and on His left the archangel Michael wielding the sword of justice, it is in the figure of Mary Magdalene kneeling at the foot of Christ that the underlying message of the sculpture is revealed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Mary Magdalene has very strong connections with France. According to tradition she&nbsp;was among the first Christian proselytizers:&nbsp;after the crucifixion she journeyed to Provence from the Holy Land converting the French to Christianity. She is also, of course&mdash;albeit wrongly&mdash;often portrayed in art and in literature as a repentant prostitute, as indeed she is here; notice, for example the contrast between the virtuous female figures to the right whose bodies are concealed and her own state of semi-nakedness.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0b0c730ef2ae1c0455d6f4db9cfba43cc5205e73.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Henri Lemaire, <em>Last Judgment </em>pediment,&nbsp;Church of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>, 1829-42, Place de la Madeleine (Paris)</span></span>As well as a straightforward Last Judgment, the inclusion of the repentant Magdalene figure has led some to read the frieze as a political allegory in which the damned stand for those who had been involved in the Revolution and who, in the eyes of the restored monarchist regime, were effectively traitors. Given that such a large portion of the French people fell into this category, rather than condemn and punish them, they were called upon to repent of their sins, as Magdalene had done, before being embraced back into the arms of the ruling establishment.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Unlike in England or America say, where public building programmes such as the British Museum or the Capitol exhibit a single-minded confidence, state architecture in France at this period reflects the country&rsquo;s complex and conflicted political landscape, made up of republicans who had fought for the Revolution, of imperialists who had followed Napoleon and of monarchists who were loyal to the king. The unsettled look and feel of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>&nbsp;is a prime example of this tendency, particularly so in the striking contrast between the outside of the building and its interior.</p>\n"
"\n"

"On entering the church we are faced with a surprisingly opulent spectacle, especially given the severity of its exterior. Standing in the narthex (porch) of the church, we look up to see a coffered barrel vault, lavishly gilded like the rest of the interior. Above the door is the famous pipe organ on which such composers as Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns and Gabriel Faur&eacute; played.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Turning around and walking down the long nave, one passes under three large domes, supported by pendentives (triangular sections of vaulting between the rim of a dome and the arches that support it), decorated with colossal relief figures. Each dome is coffered and has a glazed oculus allowing in light, features that obviously recall the Pantheon.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>It is a curious painting, completed during the July Monarchy (1830-48) when the liberal king, Louis-Philippe, struggled to reconcile those contending political factions. That Napoleon had in fact a very low opinion of the church and sought to limit its powers in France is, of course, neither here nor there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In this world the revolutionaries, like Magdalene, have repented, Napoleon is shown to have saved the day and the church and by association the Catholic monarchy are restored to their rightful place in the natural order of things. Sadly, for Louis-Philippe, it is a wildly optimistic reimagining of history, one that in the end &ndash; as the violent events of 1848, the Year of Revolutions, demonstrated &ndash; would prove ill founded.</p>\n"

"<h3>Experiência</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Place de la Madeleine had been consecrated as a site devoted to Mary Magdalene in 1182. During the period known as the First Republic (1792-1804), following the French Revolution, the foundations of earlier sacred buildings were removed and discussions were had as to what to do with the space. As France had been de-Christianized during the Revolution a civic rather than a religious function for the building was decided upon; various suggestions were put forward including a new site for the Bank of France.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Considerations were brought to a halt, however, when in 1804 Napoleon crowned himself Emperor. What followed was one of the most ambitious propaganda programs of the nineteenth century. As well as looting works from the world&rsquo;s finest collections to display in the newly refurbished Louvre, renamed the Mus&eacute;e Napoleon, some of the greatest artists and sculptors of the age were recruited to exalt the new emperor. It was only fitting that Napoleon would turn to architects, too, to realize his vision of an imperial capital city. Three monuments of particular note were constructed with this end in view: the Arc de Triomphe, the Vend&ocirc;me Column and the church at the Place de la Madeleine.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It was never Napoleon&rsquo;s intention to build a church for Mary Magdalene, though. For him the new building would stand as a Temple to the Glory of the Army, and by that, of course, he meant his own imperial army, that well-organized band of marauders who, having defeated the Austrians in the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, had managed to supplicate a great swathe of Europe. To celebrate their achievement, a competition to select the best design for the Temple was established in 1806 to be judged by to a jury selected from the Imperial Academy. As it turned out, the jury proved academic in more ways than one, their opinions counting for little as, despite their disapproval, Napoleon opted for the designs of one Pierre-Alexandre Vignon (1763-1828).&nbsp;</p>\n"

Lacking Ledoux&rsquo;s more visionary character, however, Vignon&rsquo;s design for the exterior was basically a scaled up version of the&nbsp;<em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;in N&icirc;mes.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Exterior​</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c0797eb8987cbad9e3e3ca0401b7d6f8871ed801.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Entablature (detail),,&nbsp;Church of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>, 1807-45&nbsp;(Paris)</span></span>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;though, the portico of La Madeleine has eight columns rather than six. These fluted Roman Corinthian columns &ndash; there are fifty-two of them in all &ndash; rise up to a staggering twenty meters and encompass the entire structure. The entablature they support is embellished with a bipartite architrave surmounted by a frieze with a decoration of garlands and putti.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb76385af927a4fd7fdf431c08373c85d136c113.gif\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Entablature (detail), <em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>&nbsp;c. 16 B.C.E (N&icirc;mes, Provence)</span></span>While not quite so ornate, the features, in the main, reproduce those found on the Roman temple. The dentils, those repeated teeth-like blocks that ornament the cornice, seem bulkier, however, lending the fa&ccedil;ade a somewhat more austere character.&nbsp;While the exterior bears the hallmarks of Napoleonic propaganda, evoking the grandeur of Imperial Rome, after his fall, the Bourbon Restoration (1814-30) sought to revive the relationship between church and state.&nbsp;For this reason it was decided, as the temple was still incomplete, to return to the pre-Revolution purpose of the building project, namely to construct a church dedicated to Mary Magdalene.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Pediment Frieze</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In contrast to the Napoleonic design of the temple, the pediment frieze, designed by Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire in 1829, is a masterpiece of Bourbon Restoration propaganda. The subject is&nbsp;<em>The Last Judgment</em>, a centuries-old motif found on relief sculptures above the doors of countless churches and cathedrals. While Lemaire largely follows iconographical convention, depicting Christ the Judge at the center of the composition and on His right the archangel Gabriel with his horn announcing the Day of Judgment and on His left the archangel Michael wielding the sword of justice, it is in the figure of Mary Magdalene kneeling at the foot of Christ that the underlying message of the sculpture is revealed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Mary Magdalene has very strong connections with France. Among the first Christian proselytizers, after the crucifixion she journeyed to Provence from the Holy Land converting the French to Christianity. She is also, of course &ndash; albeit wrongly &ndash; often portrayed in art and in literature as a repentant prostitute, as indeed she is here; notice, for example the contrast between the virtuous female figures to the right whose bodies are concealed and her own state of semi-nakedness.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0b0c730ef2ae1c0455d6f4db9cfba43cc5205e73.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Henri Lemaire, <em>Last Judgment </em>pediment,&nbsp;Church of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>, 1829-42, Place de la Madeleine (Paris)</span></span>As well as a straightforward Last Judgment, the inclusion of the repentant Magdalene figure has led some to read the frieze as a political allegory in which the damned stand for those who had been involved in the Revolution and who, in the eyes of the restored monarchist regime, were effectively traitors. Given that such a large portion of the French people fell into this category, rather than condemn and punish them, they were called upon to repent of their sins, as Magdalene had done, before being embraced back into the arms of the ruling establishment.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Unlike in England or America say, where public building programmes such as the British Museum or the Capitol exhibit a single-minded confidence, state architecture in France at this period reflects the country&rsquo;s complex and conflicted political landscape, made up of republicans who had fought for the Revolution, of imperialists who had followed Napoleon and of monarchists who were loyal to the king. The unsettled look and feel of&nbsp;<em>La Madeleine</em>&nbsp;is a prime example of this tendency, particularly so in the striking contrast between the outside of the building and its interior.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Interior</h3>\n"

"On entering the church we are faced with a surprisingly opulent spectacle, especially given the severity of its exterior. Standing in the narthex (porch) of the church, we look up to see a coffered barrel vault, lavishly gilded like the rest of the interior. Above the door is the famous pipe organ on which such composers as Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns and Gabriel Faur&eacute; played.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Turning around and walking down the long nave, one passes under three large domes, supported by pendentives (triangular sections of vaulting between the rim of a dome and the arches that support it), decorated with colossal relief figures. Each dome is coffered and has a glazed oculus allowing in light, features that obviously recall the Pantheon.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Three pairs of wide bays are thus created, each with pedimented niches supported by ionic columns that serve to form side altars.&nbsp;Far from the classical temple type the exterior would lead us to expect, architectural historians have compared the interior of the church to that of Roman baths; the triple cross-vaults of the Baths of Caracalla, for instance, may well have been in Vignon&rsquo;s mind when designing those domes.</p>\n"
"\n"

"<p>Beneath her is Napoleon in his coronation robes, positioned center stage, his figure directly aligned with Christ&rsquo;s.&nbsp;Facing him is Pope Pius VII, with whom he signed the Concordat of 1801, a document which reestablished the authority of the Catholic church in France after the Revolution and which is alluded to on the scroll the cardinal who stands behind Napoleon carries in his left hand.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is a curious painting, completed during the July Monarchy (1830-48) when the liberal king, Louis-Philippe, struggled to reconcile those contending political factions. That Napoleon had in fact a very low opinion of the church and sought to limit its powers in France is, of course, neither here nor there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In this world the revolutionaries, like Magdalene, have repented, Napoleon is shown to have saved the day and the church and by association the Catholic monarchy are restored to their rightful place in the natural order of things. Sadly, for Louis-Philippe, it is a wildly optimistic reimagining of history, one that in the end &ndash; as the violent events of 1848, the Year of Revolutions, demonstrated &ndash; would prove ill founded.</p>\n"

"<p><span>Despite the Holocaust, significant Jewish populations&nbsp;survived&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;Europe especially&nbsp;in Russia, the United Kingdom, and France while Jews in&nbsp;Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,&nbsp;Greece, Yugoslavia, Germany and Austria were reduced to a tiny fraction of their prewar numbers.&nbsp;Jews everywhere&nbsp;struggled to invent a&nbsp;new post-Holocaust identity. </span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Western European nations received substantial aid from the American government, and the Jewish populations in&nbsp;those areas relied on American Jewish organizations for help.&nbsp;The geographic centers of Hasidism in Eastern Europe were disproportionately destroyed during the Holocaust, but many sects continue to thrive on almost every continent. In 1948&nbsp;the United Nations unanimously voted for an independent State of Israel (the area was at that time under British administration).</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Aftermath</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the immediate aftermath of the war in Eastern Europe, the Soviets continued to downplay the role of race, as they had during the Holocaust, but while many Jews were devoted Communists, they were once again targeted as a suspicious people who could never truly be trusted comrades. Especially during the Soviet show trials in the 1950s and 1960s, Jews were purged from government ranks and executed in public spaces. &nbsp;Although Stalin voted for the creation of Israel in 1948, these public show trials served as &ldquo;a form of public-pedagogy-by-example;&rdquo; the goal was to exemplify the fact that ethnic Jews did not belong among the Communist ranks, that they were not equal with others. Even in the secular Soviet Union, overt antisemitism persisted during the Cold War decades. Many Jews made their way out from behind the iron curtain toward Western Europe, Israel, or the United States.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>American Jews in the 1950s followed the patterns of other white ethnic immigrant populations. Many left large cities, focused on education, and joined counter-cultural movements in the late 1960s and 70s. American Jews often stood at the side of the oppressed, figuring prominently in the 1960s civil&nbsp;rights movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Jews in Islamic lands emigrated from North African and Middle Eastern countries between the late 1940s and late 1960s when pan-Arab nationalism became exclusively Muslim and precluded participation from others. These Jews immigrated to Israel, Western Europe, and the United States.&nbsp;In France, the Sephardic population from Algeria, Morrocco and Tunisia brought new religious life and diverse customs to a community that&nbsp;was struggling after the trauma of World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish identity now</h3>\n"

"<p>In the modern world, Jewish identity can seem scattered, confusing, and boundless. In the United States, Jews thrived in the postwar decades&nbsp;and several different movements gained popularity: Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist.&nbsp;In Europe and Israel, inspired by these American movements, a smaller fraction of progressive Jews have formed Liberal or other kinds of Judaism. From the 1990s to the present, some American Jews have joined in a worldwide trend toward religious extremism. &nbsp;At the same time, the Reform movement has grown. The traditional separation between men and women has been broken down and women are now integrated into the rabbinate in non-Orthodox circles.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Art Spiegelman, the artist and author of <em>Maus</em>, recently reflected, &ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s become questionable to me is the way in which the Holocaust has become a central tenant of Jewishness in the late 20th century&hellip;. So that people see it as a Jewish problem and not a world problem.&rdquo; &nbsp;The omnipresence of Holocaust education within the Jewish community combined with a sort of alienation from tradition, made the Holocaust into the unifying agent that brought Jews together. In the twenty-first century, young Jews have pushed against the Holocaust as the defining feature of their Jewishness and have sought out alternative ways to express their connections to Judaism. Jewish film, music, and cultural festivals abound, attracting Jewish and non-Jewish audiences. The largest such festival occurs annually in Poland and draws tens of thousands from across the globe&mdash;that this festival takes place in the country where the greatest number of Jews were massacred during the Holocaust, signals a turn away from that dark period as the benchmark of Jewish identity and toward new forms of Jewish expression.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One popular joke says that Jews believe in &ldquo;at most&rdquo; one God. While monotheism is an important feature of Judaism, some of the greatest Rabbis from the Talmud have atheist tendencies, even as they espouse the centrality of Halakhah. As the scholar Shaye J.D. Cohen has written, &ldquo;Jewishness, like most&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;other identities, is imagined; it has no empirical objective, verifiable reality to which we can point and over which we can exclaim, &lsquo;This is it!&rsquo; &nbsp;Jewishness is in the mind.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Lacking any unifying authority, doctrine, or practice, Judaism is highly diverse and cannot be pared down to any singular concept. Instead, a set of features like common texts, a shared history, and the rhythms of religious Jewish life can help us understand a religion shaped as much by its ancient origins as its contemporary disjointedness.</p>\n"

"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b35b3f63c6baecd48e43e2f0cda0d99dad2a81fe.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Anselm Kiefer, <em>Shulamite [Sulamith]</em>, 1983, oil, emulsion, woodcut, shellac, acrylic, and straw on canvas, 541 x 368.3 cm (Doris and Donald Fisher Collection). &copy; Anselm Kiefer, courtesy of the artist. &quot;Born in Germany just months shy of the end of World War II, Anselm Kiefer came of age in the late 1960s when the silence surrounding the crimes of the Nazi regime was ruptured by a vocal younger generation horrified by their collective German &ldquo;past,&rdquo; struggling to reconcile such shame and redefine what it meant to be German in a post-Nazi world.&quot; &mdash;Rebecca Taylor</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Despite the Holocaust, significant Jewish populations&nbsp;survived&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;Europe especially&nbsp;in Russia, the United Kingdom, and France while Jews in&nbsp;Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,&nbsp;Greece, Yugoslavia, Germany and Austria were reduced to a tiny fraction of their prewar numbers.&nbsp;Jews everywhere&nbsp;struggled to invent a&nbsp;new post-Holocaust identity. </span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Western European nations received substantial aid from the American government, and the Jewish populations in&nbsp;those areas relied on American Jewish organizations for help.&nbsp;The geographic centers of Hasidism in Eastern Europe were disproportionately destroyed during the Holocaust, but many sects continue to thrive on almost every continent. In 1948&nbsp;the United Nations unanimously voted for an independent State of Israel (the area was at that time under British administration).</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Aftermath</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the immediate aftermath of the war in Eastern Europe, the Soviets continued to downplay the role of race, as they had during the Holocaust, but while many Jews were devoted Communists, they were once again targeted as a suspicious people who could never truly be trusted comrades. Especially during the Soviet show trials in the 1950s and 1960s, Jews were purged from government ranks and executed in public spaces. &nbsp;Although Stalin voted for the creation of Israel in 1948, these public show trials served as &ldquo;a form of public-pedagogy-by-example;&rdquo; the goal was to exemplify the fact that ethnic Jews did not belong among the Communist ranks, that they were not equal with others. Even in the secular Soviet Union, overt antisemitism persisted during the Cold War decades. Many Jews made their way out from behind the iron curtain toward Western Europe, Israel, or the United States.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>American Jews in the 1950s followed the patterns of other white ethnic immigrant populations. Many left large cities, focused on education, and joined counter-cultural movements in the late 1960s and 70s. American Jews often stood at the side of the oppressed, figuring prominently in the 1960s civil&nbsp;rights movement.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Jews in Islamic lands emigrated from North African and Middle Eastern countries between the late 1940s and late 1960s when pan-Arab nationalism became exclusively Muslim and precluded participation from others. These Jews immigrated to Israel, Western Europe, and the United States.&nbsp;In France, the Sephardic population from Algeria, Morrocco and Tunisia brought new religious life and diverse customs to a community that&nbsp;was struggling after the trauma of World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish identity now</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the modern world, Jewish identity can seem scattered, confusing, and boundless. In the United States, Jews thrived in the postwar decades&nbsp;and several different movements gained popularity: Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist.&nbsp;In Europe and Israel, inspired by these American movements, a smaller fraction of progressive Jews have formed Liberal or other kinds of Judaism. From the 1990s to the present, some American Jews have joined in a worldwide trend toward religious extremism. &nbsp;At the same time, the Reform movement has grown. The traditional separation between men and women has been broken down and women are now integrated into the rabbinate in non-Orthodox circles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art Spiegelman, the artist and author of <em>Maus</em>, recently reflected, &ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s become questionable to me is the way in which the Holocaust has become a central tenant of Jewishness in the late 20th century&hellip;. So that people see it as a Jewish problem and not a world problem.&rdquo; &nbsp;The omnipresence of Holocaust education within the Jewish community combined with a sort of alienation from tradition, made the Holocaust into the unifying agent that brought Jews together. In the twenty-first century, young Jews have pushed against the Holocaust as the defining feature of their Jewishness and have sought out alternative ways to express their connections to Judaism. Jewish film, music, and cultural festivals abound, attracting Jewish and non-Jewish audiences. The largest such festival occurs annually in Poland and draws tens of thousands from across the globe&mdash;that this festival takes place in the country where the greatest number of Jews were massacred during the Holocaust, signals a turn away from that dark period as the benchmark of Jewish identity and toward new forms of Jewish expression.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One popular joke says that Jews believe in &ldquo;at most&rdquo; one God. While monotheism is an important feature of Judaism, some of the greatest Rabbis from the Talmud have atheist tendencies, even as they espouse the centrality of Halakhah. As the scholar Shaye J.D. Cohen has written, &ldquo;Jewishness, like most&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;other identities, is imagined; it has no empirical objective, verifiable reality to which we can point and over which we can exclaim, &lsquo;This is it!&rsquo; &nbsp;Jewishness is in the mind.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Lacking any unifying authority, doctrine, or practice, Judaism is highly diverse and cannot be pared down to any singular concept. Instead, a set of features like common texts, a shared history, and the rhythms of religious Jewish life can help us understand a religion shaped as much by its ancient origins as its contemporary disjointedness.</p>\n"

"<h3>Breaking postwar silence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Born in Germany just months shy of the end of World War II, Anselm Kiefer came of age in the late 1960s when the silence surrounding the crimes of the Nazi regime was ruptured by a vocal younger generation horrified by their collective German &ldquo;past,&rdquo; struggling to reconcile such shame and redefine what it meant to be German in a post-Nazi world.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For Kiefer, who had studied with the artists Peter Dreher in Karlsruhe and Joseph Beuys in Dusseldorf, painting became the arena to vocalize and elucidate his contempt for the Nazis and their reprehensible legacy, instilling every brush stroke with palpable rage, grief, and shame. In the 1970s, Kiefer developed a signature style that was influenced in part by the Neo-expressionist style of Georg Baselitz, but also by his teacher Beuys, particularly Beuys&rsquo;s tendency to use commonplace materials, such as fat and felt within his artistic practice. Kiefer augmented his thick layers of impasto with lead, glass, straw, wood, dried flowers, and more, yielding highly textured, viscous surfaces. As his list of materials grew, so too did the scale of his canvases, which though large and formidable, felt ephemeral and fragile as a result of the materials he utilized.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A thick impasto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>All of the canonical elements of Kiefer&rsquo;s work are present in <em>Shulamite</em>&mdash;a thick impasto resulting from a hardened mixture of oil, acrylic, emulsion, and shellac; a brittle, textured surface infused with commonplace materials (in this case, straw and ash); mythological or biblical references (Shulamite refers to the heroine in the Song of Solomon); a literary reference (Celan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Death Fugue&rdquo;); and a historical subject or location (a Nazi Memorial Hall in Berlin).</p>\n"

Kiefer transformed architecture meant to honor Nazi heros into a memorial for their victims.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Emotional honesty</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Comparisons to Jackson Pollock in terms of both scale and expressive, gestural style are understandable, but for me Kiefer&rsquo;s paint handling is even more reminiscent of Vincent van Gogh, in terms of raw beauty and emotional honesty. Just as van Gogh&rsquo;s paint can transport me into the Dutch or French countryside and fill my nose with the smell of fresh sunflowers or irises, so too can Kiefer transport me to another place in time and space&mdash;but rather than a hayfield in Holland it is the dark abyss of a concentration camp with the stomach-churning smell of burning flesh sullying the air.</p>\n"

"<h3>El Dorado</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries Europeans were dazzled by the legend of a lost city of gold in South America. The truth behind this myth is fascinating. El Dorado&ndash;literally &ldquo;the golden one&rdquo;&ndash;actually refers to the ritual that took place at Lake Guatavita, near modern Bogot&aacute;. The newly elected leader, covered in powdered gold, dived into the lake and emerged as the new chief of the Muisca people who lived in the central highlands of present-day Colombia&#39;s Eastern Range.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mask with nose ornament, c. 500 B.C.E.–1600 C.E., possibly Yotoco or late Quimbaya, gold alloy, 15.5 x 18 cm © The Trustees of the British Museum.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0efa9e4009c7139f801c6107db2651c32d15fe1f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Mask with Nose Ornament</em>, c. 500 B.C.E.&ndash;1600 C.E., gold alloy, 15.5 x 18 cm, Quimbaya &nbsp;&copy; The Trustees of the British Museum.<br />\n"
"This spectacular hammered mask with a dangling nose ornament would probably have been placed on top of the face of a funerary bundle &ndash; the wrapped body of the deceased&mdash;transforming him into an ancestor and semi-divine figure.</span></span>The Muisca, Quimbaya, Calima, Tairona, Tolima and Zen&uacute; chiefdoms in ancient Colombia used gold to fashion some of the most visually dramatic and sophisticated works of art found anywhere in the Americas before European contact. Although gold was not valued as currency in pre-Hispanic Colombia, it had great symbolic meaning. It was one way the elite could publicly assert their rank and semi-divine status, both in life and in death.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>More than just gold</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Objects that seem at first glance made of gold are more complex and are in fact made of metal alloys. In most instances they combine, in different degrees, gold, some natural occurring silver, and copper, a combination known as tumbaga. These metals were symbolically charged in pre-Hispanic times, being associated with the sun and the moon respectively. Their combination produced a microcosm, a balance between opposites in the rendering of each object.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The creation of alloys also allowed for differences in color, ranging from reddish to golden tones. Each object had its own particular color, shine and finish thanks to the mastery and skills of the artists that produced them. Some even show contrasting colors in the same object, producing beautiful patterns and details.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Hammering and casting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Small ingots of tumbaga, in the shape of round buttons, were crafted into unique objects either by hammering or casting them (or by a combination of both techniques). Ancient Colombian artists mastered both techniques to an unprecedented degree, creating exceptional works of art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Hammering metal was a delicate process. Metal becomes easily brittle when hammered and they have to be repeatedly cooled and dipped in water before the final form is achieved. The thin sheets of gold were then cut, decorated (for example by repouss&eacute;) or joined by clipping or folding several sheets together.</p>\n"
"\n"

"<h3>El Dorado</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries Europeans were dazzled by the legend of a lost city of gold in South America. The truth behind this myth is fascinating. El Dorado&ndash;literally &ldquo;the golden one&rdquo;&ndash;actually refers to the ritual that took place at Lake Guatavita, near modern Bogot&aacute;. The newly elected leader, covered in powdered gold, dived into the lake and emerged as the new chief of the Muisca people who lived in the central highlands of present-day Colombia&#39;s Eastern Range.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mask with nose ornament, c. 500 B.C.E.–1600 C.E., possibly Yotoco or late Quimbaya, gold alloy, 15.5 x 18 cm © The Trustees of the British Museum.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0efa9e4009c7139f801c6107db2651c32d15fe1f.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Mask with Nose Ornament</em>, c. 500 B.C.E.&ndash;1600 C.E., gold alloy, 15.5 x 18 cm, Quimbaya &nbsp;&copy; The Trustees of the British Museum.<br />\n"
"This spectacular hammered mask with a dangling nose ornament would probably have been placed on top of the face of a funerary bundle &ndash; the wrapped body of the deceased&mdash;transforming him into an ancestor and semi-divine figure.</span></span>The Muisca, Quimbaya, Calima, Tairona, Tolima and Zen&uacute; chiefdoms in ancient Colombia used gold to fashion some of the most visually dramatic and sophisticated works of art found anywhere in the Americas before European contact. Although gold was not valued as currency in pre-Hispanic Colombia, it had great symbolic meaning. It was one way the elite could publicly assert their rank and semi-divine status, both in life and in death.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>More than just gold</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Objects that seem at first glance made of gold are more complex and are in fact made of metal alloys. In most instances they combine, in different degrees, gold, some natural occurring silver, and copper, a combination known as tumbaga. These metals were symbolically charged in pre-Hispanic times, being associated with the sun and the moon respectively. Their combination produced a microcosm, a balance between opposites in the rendering of each object.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The creation of alloys also allowed for differences in color, ranging from reddish to golden tones. Each object had its own particular color, shine and finish thanks to the mastery and skills of the artists that produced them. Some even show contrasting colors in the same object, producing beautiful patterns and details.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Hammering and casting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Small ingots of tumbaga, in the shape of round buttons, were crafted into unique objects either by hammering or casting them (or by a combination of both techniques). Ancient Colombian artists mastered both techniques to an unprecedented degree, creating exceptional works of art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Hammering metal was a delicate process. Metal becomes easily brittle when hammered and they have to be repeatedly cooled and dipped in water before the final form is achieved. The thin sheets of gold were then cut, decorated (for example by repouss&eacute;) or joined by clipping or folding several sheets together.</p>\n"

This is an object that invites close looking to fully appreciate&nbsp;the process by which colorful beads animate the bag, making a dazzling object and showcasing remarkable technical skill.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What is a Bandolier Bag?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags&nbsp;are based on bags carried by European soldiers armed with rifles, who used the bags to store ammunition cartridges.&nbsp;While Bandolier Bags were made by different tribes and First Nations across the Great Lakes and Prairie regions, they differ in appearance. The stylistic differences are the result of personal preference as much&nbsp;contact with Europeans and Euro-Americans, goods acquired in trade, and travel.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, based in Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\n"

"\n"
"<p>The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in New York City&nbsp;has a wonderful example of a Bandolier Bag, most likely&nbsp;made by a Lenape artist (the Lenape are part of the Delaware tribe or First Nation, who lived along the Delaware River and parts of what is today New York State).&nbsp;[2]</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags (like this&nbsp;one) are often large in size and decorated with a wide array of colorful beads and ribbons. They are worn as a cross-body bag, with a thick strap crossing a person&rsquo;s chest to allow it to rest on the hip.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These bags were especially popular in the late nineteenth century in the Eastern or Woodlands region, which comprised parts of what is today Canada and the United States. The Woodlands area encompasses the Great Lakes Region and terrain east of the Mississippi River. This enormous geographic area has a long, complex history including the production of&nbsp;objects we today recognize as&nbsp;&ldquo;art,&rdquo;&nbsp;that date back more than 4,000 years.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Map: the Eastern Woodlands extended roughly from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern Great Plains, and from the Great Lakes region to the Gulf of Mexico.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3e227b06a299936f0a28c91436bb8798f95399dd.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">The Eastern Woodlands (on the map above &quot;Northeast&quot; and &quot;Southeast&quot;)&nbsp;extended roughly from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern Great Plains, and from the Great Lakes region to the Gulf of Mexico.</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags were created across this vast expanse of land, and the NMAI has examples from the Upper Great Lakes region and Oklahoma. Due to events and laws like the Indian Removal Act of 1830 (signed by President Andrew Jackson), the Lenape&nbsp;were forcibly removed from these ancestral lands and relocated to areas of Oklahoma,&nbsp;Wisconsin, and&nbsp;Ontario, Canada. Despite these traumatic relocations, tribes like the Lenape continued to create objects as they had in ancestral lands. Bandolier bags are one example of this continued artistic production.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Material&nbsp;and design</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: Wisconsin Historical Society)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9eb4a521e72465e3909c51906cb5778c437af655.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/exhibits/p2p/red/impressions.asp\">Wisconsin Historical Society</a>)</span></span>While men most commonly wore these bags, women created them. Initially, Bandolier&nbsp;Bags did not have a pocket, but were intended to complement men&rsquo;s ceremonial outfits. Men even wore more than one bag on occasion, dressing themselves in a rainbow of colors and patterns. Even those bags with pockets weren&rsquo;t necessarily always used to hold objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Women typically produced Bandolier Bags using trade cloth, made from cotton or wool. It is often possible to see the exposed unembroidered trade cloth underneath the cross-body strap. The NMAI bag (above) uses animal hide in addition to the cotton cloth, combining materials that had long been used among these groups (animal hides) with new materials (cotton trade cloth).&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beads and other materials were embroidered on the trade cloth and hide. The tiny glass beads, called seed beads, were acquired from European traders, and they were prized for their brilliant colors. Glass beads replaced porcupine quillwork, which had&nbsp;a longstanding history in this area. Before the use of glass beads, porcupine quills were acquired (carefully!), softened and dyed. Once they were malleable enough to bend, the quills were woven onto the surfaces of objects (especially&nbsp;clothing or other cloth&nbsp;goods like bags). Quillwork required different working techniques than embroidering with beads, so people adopted new methods for&nbsp;decorating the surfaces of bags, clothing, and other goods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Silk ribbons (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, based in Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/babde6866812c86d876263f6c7f2338b9fa5e318.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Silk ribbons (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span>In addition to glass beads, the NMAI bag is decorated with silk ribbons&mdash;also procured via trade with Europeans. Much like the glass beads, silk ribbons offered a new material with a greater variety of color choices. Looking at the NMAI bag, we can see that the&nbsp;artists attached strips of yellow, blue, red, and green ribbons, like tassels, to the ends of the straps, as well as longer orange ribbons that fall&nbsp;below the bottom of the bag. Before the introduction of ribbons, women would paint the surface of hides in addition to decorating the bags with&nbsp;quillwork. Ribbons afforded women the opportunity to produce more textural variation, and&nbsp;to expand the surface of the bags in new ways. Imagine wearing this bag: the bright colors would attract attention and the sparkle of the beads would reflect sunlight as the ribbons fluttered in the wind or moved as one walked.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Further animating the surface of the NMAI Bandolier Bag is a red wool fringe, capped with metal cones that attach to the bag&rsquo;s rectangular pouch. Like the ribbons and beads, the fringe and metal offered more colors and textures to the bag&rsquo;s surface.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Fringe (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, based in Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e4b068e0a7cef2d274de469a0f3d19cfadc1524d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Fringe (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe,&nbsp;Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The designs on the bag are abstracted and symmetrical. White beads act as contour lines to help make the designs&nbsp;more visible to the naked eye. On the cross-body strap, we see a design that branches in four directions. Yet notice how the artist has actually made each side slightly different. The left portion of the strap displays a light&nbsp;blue background, and the repeating form is more rounded, with softer edges. On the right side of the strap, the blue is darker,&nbsp;the framing&nbsp;pink and green is varied, and the repeating form displays more straight lines. The small size of seed beads allowed for more curvilinear designs than quillwork.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Strap (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, based in Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/be6c87bd077e54de0ede7af348995739aebb32c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Strap (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is possible that the&nbsp;contrasting colors&nbsp;represent&nbsp;the Celestial/Sky&nbsp;and Underworld realms.&nbsp;The abstracted designs on the sash may also be read in relation to the cosmos because they branch into four directions, which might relate to the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) and the division of the terrestrial (earthly) realm into four quadrants.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Prairie Style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The NMAI Bandolier Bag relates to a broader array of objects that demonstrate the Prairie Style.&nbsp;The artist of the&nbsp;NMAI Bandolier Bag&nbsp;borrowed from older Delaware traditions, as well as those of other&nbsp;native peoples after they were forcibly relocated. Another Bandolier bag in the NMAI collection (below), by an Anishnaabe artist, demonstrates the &ldquo;Prairie Style&rdquo; clearly in the upper section where&nbsp;a floral motif floats against a dark ground.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Bandolier Bag, Anishnaabe (Chippewa/Ojibwe), c. 1870, Upper Great Lakes, wool, cotton cloth, and glass beads. 87 x 26 cm (National Museum of the American IndianI, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7313c3f32913636aaffea251dd41ee1f695c62c9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Bandolier Bag, Anishnaabe (Chippewa/Ojibwe), c. 1870, Upper Great Lakes, wool, cotton cloth, and glass beads. 87 x 26 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"

The patterns could be either naturalistic flowers or abstract floral designs. A Sac and Fox&nbsp;breechcloth in the NMAI collection (left) is a clear example of the more abstract Prairie Style because the floral designs do not closely resemble flowers that you might see in nature&nbsp;(the Sacs or Sauks are an Eastern Woodlands group, the Fox tribe is closely related to them, and they are both&nbsp;centered in Oklahoma today, though&nbsp;there are Sac and Fox tribes in Iowa and Kansas as well).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Prairie Style&nbsp;is the result of peoples coming into contact with one another, particularly in the wake of removal from their ancestral homelands. Floral forms, combined with the use of ribbons and colorful glass beads, not only attest&nbsp;to the transformations in&nbsp;artistic production, but also testifies to the creativity of people as they adapted to new situations. Bandolier Bags, as well as other objects and clothing, helped to express group identities and social status. In the wake of forced removals and threats to traditional ways of life, objects like the NMAI Bandolier Bag demonstrate the resilience and continued creativity of groups like the Lenape.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Today</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags are still made and worn today&mdash;attesting to their rich and complex&nbsp;history and their continuing ceremonial and cultural functions. For example, when the NMAI opened a new museum in Washington, D.C., in 2004, Ojibwe men wore colorful Bandolier Bags during the opening festivities and ceremonies. Artists continue to innovate by creating new interpretations of Bandolier Bags. Maria Hupfield, who belongs to the Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada, and currently lives in Brooklyn, made a Bandolier Bag from gray felt&mdash;an industrial material transformed&nbsp;into something beautiful and historically significant.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Essay by Dr. Lauren Kilroy-Ewbank</p>\n"

"<p>[1]&nbsp;Anishnaabe is the name for the ethnic group that comprises the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi First Nations around the Great Lakes. Due to relocations of the nineteenth century, many other groups like the Delaware and Dakota currently live on the same lands.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>[2] In the United States, it is more common to see the term &ldquo;Native American,&rdquo; &ldquo;Native,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Indigenous,&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;First Nations&rdquo; used more frequently in Canada.</p>\n"

"<p>Bandolier Bags were created across this vast expanse of land, and the NMAI has examples from the Upper Great Lakes region and Oklahoma. Due to events and laws like the Indian Removal Act of 1830 (signed by President Andrew Jackson), the Lenape&nbsp;were forcibly removed from these ancestral lands and relocated to areas of Oklahoma,&nbsp;Wisconsin, and&nbsp;Ontario, Canada. Despite these traumatic relocations, tribes like the Lenape continued to create objects as they had in ancestral lands. Bandolier bags are one example of this continued artistic production.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Material&nbsp;and design</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: Wisconsin Historical Society)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9eb4a521e72465e3909c51906cb5778c437af655.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Chief Cloud Wearing a Bandolier Bag (source: <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/exhibits/p2p/red/impressions.asp\">Wisconsin Historical Society</a>)</span></span>While men most commonly wore these bags, women created them. Initially, Bandolier&nbsp;Bags did not have a pocket, but were intended to complement men&rsquo;s ceremonial outfits. Men even wore more than one bag on occasion, dressing themselves in a rainbow of colors and patterns. Even those bags with pockets weren&rsquo;t necessarily always used to hold objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Women typically produced Bandolier Bags using trade cloth, made from cotton or wool. It is often possible to see the exposed unembroidered trade cloth underneath the cross-body strap. The NMAI bag (above) uses animal hide in addition to the cotton cloth, combining materials that had long been used among these groups (animal hides) with new materials (cotton trade cloth).&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beads and other materials were embroidered on the trade cloth and hide. The tiny glass beads, called seed beads, were acquired from European traders, and they were prized for their brilliant colors. Glass beads replaced porcupine quillwork, which had&nbsp;a longstanding history in this area. Before the use of glass beads, porcupine quills were acquired (carefully!), softened and dyed. Once they were malleable enough to bend, the quills were woven onto the surfaces of objects (especially&nbsp;clothing or other cloth&nbsp;goods like bags). Quillwork required different working techniques than embroidering with beads, so people adopted new methods for&nbsp;decorating the surfaces of bags, clothing, and other goods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/babde6866812c86d876263f6c7f2338b9fa5e318.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Silk ribbons (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span>In addition to glass beads, the NMAI bag is decorated with silk ribbons&mdash;also procured via trade with Europeans. Much like the glass beads, silk ribbons offered a new material with a greater variety of color choices. Looking at the NMAI bag, we can see that the&nbsp;artists attached strips of yellow, blue, red, and green ribbons, like tassels, to the ends of the straps, as well as longer orange ribbons that fall&nbsp;below the bottom of the bag. Before the introduction of ribbons, women would paint the surface of hides in addition to decorating the bags with&nbsp;quillwork. Ribbons afforded women the opportunity to produce more textural variation, and&nbsp;to expand the surface of the bags in new ways. Imagine wearing this bag: the bright colors would attract attention and the sparkle of the beads would reflect sunlight as the ribbons fluttered in the wind or moved as one walked.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Further animating the surface of the NMAI Bandolier Bag is a red wool fringe, capped with metal cones that attach to the bag&rsquo;s rectangular pouch. Like the ribbons and beads, the fringe and metal offered more colors and textures to the bag&rsquo;s surface.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e4b068e0a7cef2d274de469a0f3d19cfadc1524d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Fringe (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe,&nbsp;Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The designs on the bag are abstracted and symmetrical. White beads act as contour lines to help make the designs&nbsp;more visible to the naked eye. On the cross-body strap, we see a design that branches in four directions. Yet notice how the artist has actually made each side slightly different. The left portion of the strap displays a light&nbsp;blue background, and the repeating form is more rounded, with softer edges. On the right side of the strap, the blue is darker,&nbsp;the framing&nbsp;pink and green is varied, and the repeating form displays more straight lines. The small size of seed beads allowed for more curvilinear designs than quillwork.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/be6c87bd077e54de0ede7af348995739aebb32c3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Strap (detail), Bandolier Bag, Lenape (Delaware tribe, Oklahoma), c. 1850 C.E., hide, cotton cloth, silk ribbon, glass beads, wool yarn, metal cones, 68 x 47 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is possible that the&nbsp;contrasting colors&nbsp;represent&nbsp;the Celestial/Sky&nbsp;and Underworld realms.&nbsp;The abstracted designs on the sash may also be read in relation to the cosmos because they branch into four directions, which might relate to the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) and the division of the terrestrial (earthly) realm into four quadrants.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Prairie Style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The NMAI Bandolier Bag relates to a broader array of objects that demonstrate the Prairie Style.&nbsp;The artist of the&nbsp;NMAI Bandolier Bag&nbsp;borrowed from older Delaware traditions, as well as those of other&nbsp;native peoples after they were forcibly relocated. Another Bandolier bag in the NMAI collection (below), by an Anishnaabe artist, demonstrates the &ldquo;Prairie Style&rdquo; clearly in the upper section where&nbsp;a floral motif floats against a dark ground.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Bandolier Bag, Anishnaabe (Chippewa/Ojibwe), c. 1870, Upper Great Lakes, wool, cotton cloth, and glass beads. 87 x 26 cm (National Museum of the American IndianI, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7313c3f32913636aaffea251dd41ee1f695c62c9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Bandolier Bag, Anishnaabe (Chippewa/Ojibwe), c. 1870, Upper Great Lakes, wool, cotton cloth, and glass beads. 87 x 26 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Sac and Fox man’s breechcloth, c. 1880, Oklahoma, wool cloth, cotton cloth, glass bead/beads, cotton thread, 135 x 45 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b990dafe1e54df50d2ede68b60e05554be068c97.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Sac and Fox man&rsquo;s breechcloth, c. 1880, Oklahoma, wool cloth, cotton, glass bead/beads, cotton thread, 135 x 45 cm (National Museum of the American Indian, New York)</span></span>The Prairie Style&nbsp;used&nbsp;colorful glass beads&nbsp;fashioned in floral patterns. The patterns could be either naturalistic flowers or abstract floral designs. A Sac and Fox&nbsp;breechcloth in the NMAI collection (left) is a clear example of the more abstract Prairie Style because the floral designs do not closely resemble flowers that you might see in nature&nbsp;(the Sacs or Sauks are an Eastern Woodlands group, the Fox tribe is closely related to them, and they are both&nbsp;centered in Oklahoma today, though&nbsp;there are Sac and Fox tribes in Iowa and Kansas as well).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Prairie Style&nbsp;is the result of peoples coming into contact with one another, particularly in the wake of removal from their ancestral homelands. Floral forms, combined with the use of ribbons and colorful glass beads, not only attest&nbsp;to the transformations in&nbsp;artistic production, but also testifies to the creativity of people as they adapted to new situations. Bandolier Bags, as well as other objects and clothing, helped to express group identities and social status. In the wake of forced removals and threats to traditional ways of life, objects like the NMAI Bandolier Bag demonstrate the resilience and continued creativity of groups like the Lenape.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Hoje</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Bandolier Bags are still made and worn today&mdash;attesting to their rich and complex&nbsp;history and their continuing ceremonial and cultural functions. For example, when the NMAI opened a new museum in Washington, D.C., in 2004, Ojibwe men wore colorful Bandolier Bags during the opening festivities and ceremonies. Artists continue to innovate by creating new interpretations of Bandolier Bags. Maria Hupfield, who belongs to the Wasauksing First Nation in Ontario, Canada, and currently lives in Brooklyn, made a Bandolier Bag from gray felt&mdash;an industrial material transformed&nbsp;into something beautiful and historically significant.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Essay by Dr. Lauren Kilroy-Ewbank</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>[1]&nbsp;Anishnaabe is the name for the ethnic group that comprises the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi First Nations around the Great Lakes. Due to relocations of the nineteenth century, many other groups like the Delaware and Dakota currently live on the same lands.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>[2] In the United States, it is more common to see the term &ldquo;Native American,&rdquo; &ldquo;Native,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Indigenous,&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;First Nations&rdquo; used more frequently in Canada.</p>\n"

"<h3>Appreciating &amp; understanding ancient Egyptian art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Ancient Egyptian art must be viewed from the standpoint of the ancient Egyptians to understand it. The somewhat static, usually formal, strangely abstract, and often blocky nature of much Egyptian imagery has, at times, led to unfavorable comparisons with later, and much more &lsquo;naturalistic,&rsquo; Greek or Renaissance art. However, the art of the Egyptians served a vastly different purpose than that of these later cultures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Art not meant to be seen</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While today we marvel at the glittering treasures from the tomb of Tutankhamun, the sublime reliefs in New Kingdom tombs, and the serene beauty of Old Kingdom statuary, it is imperative to remember that the majority of these works were never intended to be seen&mdash;that was simply not their purpose.</p>\n"

"<h3>The function of Egyptian art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These images, whether statues or relief, were designed to benefit a divine or deceased recipient. Statuary provided a place for the recipient to manifest and receive the benefit of ritual action. Most statues show a formal frontality, meaning they are arranged straight ahead, because they were designed to face the ritual being performed before them. Many statues were also originally placed in recessed niches or other architectural settings&mdash;contexts that would make frontality their expected and natural mode.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Statuary, whether divine, royal, or elite, provided a kind of conduit for the spirit (or ka) of that being to interact with the terrestrial realm. Divine cult statues (few of which survive) were the subject of daily rituals of clothing, anointing, and perfuming with incense and were carried in processions for special festivals so that the people could &quot;see&quot; them (they were almost all entirely shrouded from view, but their &#39;presence&#39; was felt).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Royal and elite statuary served as intermediaries between the people and the gods. Family chapels with the statuary of a deceased forefather could serve as a sort of &#39;family temple.&#39; There were festivals in honor of the dead, where the family would come and eat in the chapel, offering food for the Afterlife, flowers (symbols of rebirth), and incense (the scent of which was considered divine). Preserved letters let us know that the deceased was actively petitioned for their assistance, both in this world and the next.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What we see in museums</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Generally, the works we see on display in museums were products of royal or elite workshops; these pieces fit best with our modern aesthetic and ideas of beauty. Most museum basements, however, are packed with hundreds (even thousands!) of other objects made for people of lower status&mdash;small statuary, amulets, coffins, and stelae (similar to modern tombstones) that are completely recognizable, but rarely displayed. These pieces generally show less quality in the workmanship; being oddly proportioned or poorly executed; they are less often considered &lsquo;art&rsquo; in the modern sense. However, these objects served the exact same function of providing benefit to their owners (and to the same degree of effectiveness), as those made for the elite.</p>\n"

"<h3>Modes of representation for three-dimensional art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Three-dimensional representations, while being quite formal, also aimed to reproduce the real-world&mdash;statuary of gods, royalty, and the elite was designed to convey an idealized version of that individual. Some aspects of &lsquo;naturalism&rsquo; were dictated by the material. Stone statuary, for example, was quite closed&mdash;with arms held close to the sides, limited positions, a strong back pillar that provided support, and with the fill spaces left between limbs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Painted wooden model of the deceased overseeing the counting of cattle in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo (Middle Kingdom).

Photo: Dr. Amy Calvert</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wood and metal statuary, in contrast, was more expressive&mdash;arms could be extended and hold separate objects, spaces between the limbs were opened to create a more realistic appearance, and more positions were possible. Stone, wood, and metal statuary of elite figures, however, all served the same functions and retained the same type of formalization and frontality. Only statuettes of lower status people displayed a wide range of possible actions, and these pieces were focused on the actions, which benefitted the elite owner, not the people involved.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Modes of representation for two-dimensional art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two-dimensional art represented the world quite differently. Egyptian artists embraced the two-dimensional surface and attempted to provide the most representative aspects of each element in the scenes rather than attempting to create vistas that replicated the real world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each object or element in a scene was rendered from its most recognizable angle and these were then grouped together to create the whole. This is why images of people show their face, waist, and limbs in profile, but eye and shoulders frontally. These scenes are complex composite images that provide complete information about the various elements, rather than ones designed from a single viewpoint, which would not be as comprehensive in the data they conveyed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Painted sunk relief showing orderly registers in the Temple of Ramses II at Abydos (New Kingdom).

Photo: Dr. Amy Calvert</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Registers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Scenes were ordered in parallel lines, known as registers. These registers separate the scene as well as provide ground lines for the figures. Scenes without registers are unusual and were generally only used to specifically evoke chaos; battle and hunting scenes will often show the prey or foreign armies without groundlines. Registers were also used to convey information about the scenes&mdash;the higher up in the scene, the higher the status; overlapping figures imply that the ones underneath are further away, as are those elements that are higher within the register.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Hierarchy of scale</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Difference in scale was the most commonly used method for conveying hierarchy&mdash;the larger the scale of the figures, the more important they were. Kings were often shown at the same scale as deities, but both are shown larger than the elite and far larger than the average Egyptian.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Text and image</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Highly detailed raised relief hieroglyphs on the White Chapel of Senusret I at Karnak (Middle Kingdom). Photo: Dr Amy Calvert\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6dec7a9e285029649df3ba5f1a93695e2dbf4093.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Highly detailed raised relief hieroglyphs on the White Chapel of Senusret I at Karnak (Middle Kingdom). Photo: Dr Amy Calvert</span></span>Text accompanied almost all images. In statuary, identifying text will appear on the back pillar or base, and relief usually has captions or longer texts that complete and elaborate on the scenes. Hieroglyphs were often rendered as tiny works of art in themselves, even though these small pictures do not always stand for what they depict; many are instead phonetic sounds. Some, however, are logographic, meaning they stand for an object or concept.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lines blur between text and image in many cases. For instance, the name of a figure in the text on a statue will regularly omit the determinative (an unspoken sign at the end of a word that aids identification&ndash;for example, verbs of motion are followed by a pair of walking legs, names of men end with the image of a man, names of gods with the image of a seated god, etc.) at the end of the name. In these instances, the representation itself serves this function.</p>\n"

This is why images of people show their face, waist, and limbs in profile, but eye and shoulders frontally. These scenes are complex composite images that provide complete information about the various elements, rather than ones designed from a single viewpoint, which would not be as comprehensive in the data they conveyed.</p>\n"

"<h3>Registers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Scenes were ordered in parallel lines, known as registers. These registers separate the scene as well as provide ground lines for the figures. Scenes without registers are unusual and were generally only used to specifically evoke chaos; battle and hunting scenes will often show the prey or foreign armies without groundlines. Registers were also used to convey information about the scenes&mdash;the higher up in the scene, the higher the status; overlapping figures imply that the ones underneath are further away, as are those elements that are higher within the register.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Hierarchy of scale</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Difference in scale was the most commonly used method for conveying hierarchy&mdash;the larger the scale of the figures, the more important they were. Kings were often shown at the same scale as deities, but both are shown larger than the elite and far larger than the average Egyptian.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Text and image</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Highly detailed raised relief hieroglyphs on the White Chapel of Senusret I at Karnak (Middle Kingdom).

Photo: Dr Amy Calvert</span></span>Text accompanied almost all images. In statuary, identifying text will appear on the back pillar or base, and relief usually has captions or longer texts that complete and elaborate on the scenes. Hieroglyphs were often rendered as tiny works of art in themselves, even though these small pictures do not always stand for what they depict; many are instead phonetic sounds. Some, however, are logographic, meaning they stand for an object or concept.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lines blur between text and image in many cases. For instance, the name of a figure in the text on a statue will regularly omit the determinative (an unspoken sign at the end of a word that aids identification&ndash;for example, verbs of motion are followed by a pair of walking legs, names of men end with the image of a man, names of gods with the image of a seated god, etc.) at the end of the name. In these instances, the representation itself serves this function.</p>\n"

Beginning before the turn of the 18th century, but accelerated by the opportunity opened by the death of the Sun King in 1715, nobles set up their own homes after decades of living under the king&rsquo;s enormous roof at Versailles, and created a radically different domestic life. Although it was only seven years until Louis XIV&rsquo;s great-grandson was old enough to take the throne to reign as Louis XV, by 1722 new ideas of privacy, comfort, and intimate home life led to a new design language, the Rococo.

"<h3>A move away from Baroque grandeur and classicism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Louis XIV, during his long reign, had established France as a major European economic and political power, not least by the use of design as a strategic propaganda tool. Where the grandeur, drama, and theatricality of the Baroque, as Louis imported it from Rome, had been the perfect tool for portraying the King and his country as supremely powerful, by the early 18th century, the Baroque was starting to seem exhaustingly sumptuous. Baroque design was based on the classical language, which the earlier Renaissance artists had delighted in rediscovering, augmenting, and modifying. But by the early decades of the 18th century, designers were increasingly turning away from bombastic classicism to other sources, notably the natural world. They began playing with un-classical ideas like asymmetry, movement, linearity, sinuous curves, and realistic natural ornament. The Rococo, as it developed in design, was a sharp turn away from everything the Baroque had become. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

Furthermore, he signed his pieces (BVRB). In keeping with Enlightenment ideas of the 18th century which celebrated individuality and personal achievement, increasingly craftsmen were identifying themselves with their work.

"\n"
"<p>In 1226 a French king died, leaving his queen to rule his kingdom until their son came of age. The 38-year-old widow, Blanche of Castile, had her work cut out for her. Rebelling barons were eager to win back lands that her husband&rsquo;s father had seized from them. They rallied troops against her, defamed her character, and even accused her of adultery and murder.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Caught in a perilous web of treachery, insurrections, and open warfare, Blanche persuaded, cajoled, negotiated, and fought would-be enemies after her husband, King Louis VIII, died of dysentery after only a three-year reign.

"<h3>A manuscript illumination</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A dazzling illumination in New York&rsquo;s Morgan Library could well depict Blanche of Castile and her son Louis, a beardless youth crowned king. A cleric and a scribe are depicted underneath them. Each figure is set against a ground of burnished gold, seated beneath a trefoil arch. Stylized and colorful buildings dance above their heads, suggesting a sophisticated, urban setting&mdash;perhaps Paris, the capital city of the Capetian kingdom (the Capetians were one of the oldest royal families in France) and home to a renowned school of theology.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A moralized Bible&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This last page the New York Morgan Library&rsquo;s manuscript MS M 240 is the last quire (folded page) of a three-volume moralized bible, the majority of which is housed at the Cathedral Treasury in Toledo, Spain. Moralized bibles, made expressedly for the French royal house, include lavishly illustrated abbreviated passages from the Old and New Testaments. Explanatory texts that allude to historical events and tales accompany these literary and visual readings, which&mdash;woven together&mdash;convey a moral.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Assuming historians are correct in identifying the two rulers, we are looking at the four people intensely involved in the production of this manuscript. As patron and ruler, Queen Blanche of Castile would have financed its production. As ruler-to-be, Louis IX&rsquo;s job was to take its lessons to heart along with those from the other biblical and ancient texts that his tutors read with him. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>King and queen&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the upper register, an enthroned king and queen wear the traditional medieval open crown topped with fleur-de-lys&mdash;a stylized iris or lily symbolizing a French monarch&rsquo;s religious, political, and dynastic right to rule. The blue-eyed queen, left, is veiled in a white widow&rsquo;s wimple. An ermine-lined blue mantle drapes over her shoulders. Her pink T-shaped tunic spills over a thin blue edge of paint which visually supports these enthroned figures. A slender green column divides the queen&rsquo;s space from that of her son, King Louis IX, to whom she deliberately gestures across the page, raising her left hand in his direction. Her pose and animated facial expression suggest that she is dedicating this manuscript, with its lessons and morals, to the young king.</p>\n"

"<p>In 1226 a French king died, leaving his queen to rule his kingdom until their son came of age. The 38-year-old widow, Blanche of Castile, had her work cut out for her. Rebelling barons were eager to win back lands that her husband&rsquo;s father had seized from them. They rallied troops against her, defamed her character, and even accused her of adultery and murder.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Caught in a perilous web of treachery, insurrections, and open warfare, Blanche persuaded, cajoled, negotiated, and fought would-be enemies after her husband, King Louis VIII, died of dysentery after only a three-year reign.

"<h3>A manuscript illumination</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A dazzling illumination in New York&rsquo;s Morgan Library could well depict Blanche of Castile and her son Louis, a beardless youth crowned king. A cleric and a scribe are depicted underneath them. Each figure is set against a ground of burnished gold, seated beneath a trefoil arch. Stylized and colorful buildings dance above their heads, suggesting a sophisticated, urban setting&mdash;perhaps Paris, the capital city of the Capetian kingdom (the Capetians were one of the oldest royal families in France) and home to a renowned school of theology.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A moralized Bible&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This last page the New York Morgan Library&rsquo;s manuscript MS M 240 is the last quire (folded page) of a three-volume moralized bible, the majority of which is housed at the Cathedral Treasury in Toledo, Spain. Moralized bibles, made expressedly for the French royal house, include lavishly illustrated abbreviated passages from the Old and New Testaments. Explanatory texts that allude to historical events and tales accompany these literary and visual readings, which&mdash;woven together&mdash;convey a moral.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Assuming historians are correct in identifying the two rulers, we are looking at the four people intensely involved in the production of this manuscript. As patron and ruler, Queen Blanche of Castile would have financed its production. As ruler-to-be, Louis IX&rsquo;s job was to take its lessons to heart along with those from the other biblical and ancient texts that his tutors read with him. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>King and queen&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the upper register, an enthroned king and queen wear the traditional medieval open crown topped with fleur-de-lys&mdash;a stylized iris or lily symbolizing a French monarch&rsquo;s religious, political, and dynastic right to rule. The blue-eyed queen, left, is veiled in a white widow&rsquo;s wimple. An ermine-lined blue mantle drapes over her shoulders. Her pink T-shaped tunic spills over a thin blue edge of paint which visually supports these enthroned figures. A slender green column divides the queen&rsquo;s space from that of her son, King Louis IX, to whom she deliberately gestures across the page, raising her left hand in his direction. Her pose and animated facial expression suggest that she is dedicating this manuscript, with its lessons and morals, to the young king.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Numerous snakes&nbsp;appear to writhe across the sculpture&rsquo;s surface. In fact, snakes form her entire skirt, as well as her belt and even her head.

Her upper torso is exposed, and we can just make out her breasts and rolls in her abdomen. The rolls indicate she is a mother. A sizable necklace formed of hands and hearts largely obscures her breasts.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two enormous snakes curl upwards from her neck to face one another. Their bifurcated, or split, tongues curl downwards, and the resulting effect is that the snake heads and tongues appear to be a single, forward-facing serpent face. Snakes coming out of body parts,&nbsp;as we see here, was an Aztec convention for squirting blood. Coatlicue has in fact been decapitated, and her snaky head represents the blood squirting from her severed neck. Her arms are also formed of snake heads, suggesting she was&nbsp;dismembered there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>You might read elsewhere that Coatlicue was decapitated by her daughter or beheaded when her son was born from her severed neck (the idea has been adopted in part to explain this&nbsp;monumental sculpture). However, the myth from which this story derives does not actually state that Coatlicue suffered this fate. For this reason, it is useful to review the myth&mdash;one of the most important for the Aztecs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Battle atop Snake Mountain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The primary myth in which Coatlicue is involved recounts the birth of the Aztec patron deity, Huitzilopochtli (pronounced &quot;wheat-zil-oh-poach-lee&quot;). This myth was recorded in the later sixteenth century after the Spanish Conquest of 1521.&nbsp;The main source from which we learn about it is the <em>General History of the Things of New Spain</em>, also called <em>The Florentine Codex </em>(written 1575&ndash;77 and compiled by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, indigenous authors and artists, and indigenous informants).[1]</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahagún, General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex), 1575–77, volume 1, page 420\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cc0858043f003a3d842f1cc2cb564a95483151c7.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, <em>General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex)</em>, 1575&ndash;77, volume 1, page 420</span></span>One day Coatlicue, an earth goddess, was sweeping atop Coatepec (or Snake Mountain), when a feather fell into her apron. At that moment, she immaculately conceived a son, whose name was Huitzilopochtli (a sun and warrior god). Upon hearing that her mother was pregnant, Coyolxauhqui (or Bells-Her-Cheeks, pronounced &quot;coy-al-shauw-kee&quot;) became enraged. She rallied her 400 brothers, the <em>Centzonhuitz-nahua,</em>&nbsp;to storm Snake Mountain and kill their mother. One of the brothers decided to warn Coatlicue. Upon hearing of this impending murder, Coatlicue became understandably afraid. But Huitzilopochtli comforted her, telling her not to worry. At the moment Coyolxauhqui approached her mother, Huitzilopochtli was born, fully grown and armed. He sliced off his sister&rsquo;s head, and threw her body off the mountain. As she fell, her body broke apart until it came to rest&nbsp;at the bottom of Snake Mountain. But what became of Coatlicue, the mother to the victorious Huitzilopochtli and the defeated Coyolxauhqui? The myth does not mention her decapitation and dismemberment (only her daughter&rsquo;s), so why would this&nbsp;famous&nbsp;sculpture display her in this manner?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why was Coatlicue decapitated?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More recently, a new interpretation has been offered for Coatlicue&rsquo;s appearance that is based on another myth (recounted in different Spanish Colonial source) concerning the beginning of 5th era, or 5th sun.The Aztecs believed that there were four earlier suns (or eras) prior to the one in which we currently live. The myth notes that several female deities (perhaps Coatlicue among them), sacrificed themselves to put the sun in motion, effectively allowing time itself to continue. They were responsible for preserving the cosmos by offering their own lives.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt,  257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7245a7e2066f010d3debbb789296c8c86049d06d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt, 257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After this point, these female deities were then symbolized by their skirts (called <em>mantas</em>), which could explain the careful attention paid to Coatlicue&rsquo;s snaky skirt. It functions as a reminder of her name&mdash;Snakes-Her-Skirt&mdash;as well as symbolizing&nbsp;her as a deity and&nbsp;reminding the viewer&nbsp;of her past deeds. This might also explain why&mdash;in place of her head&mdash;we have two snakes rising from her severed neck.&nbsp;They represent streaming blood, which was a precious liquid connoting fertility. With her willing sacrifice, Coatlicue enabled life to continue.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some details on the sculpture support this newer and enticing interpretation. There is a date glyph, 12 Reed, inscribed on the sculpture&rsquo;s back which might relate to the beginning of a new solar era. Archaeologists have also found the remains of several other monumental sculptures of female deities similar to Coatlicue, but each display different skirts. One of these sculptures (see photo at top of the page) stands near to Coatlicue in the Anthropology Museum, but hearts adorn her skirt instead of snakes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Coatlicue de Cozcatlán, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8f7c8d37b4ea61b5e1720fae09c36a7f8792f7ca.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coatlicue de Cozcatl&aacute;n, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span>Despite her fame in one of the most important Aztec myths concerning their patron god, Coatlicue did not have numerous stories recorded about her during the sixteenth century (that we know of at least). Few surviving Aztec objects display her. However, another stone sculpture in the National Museum of Anthropology&mdash;on a much smaller scale&mdash;shows Coatlicue with her head intact. We can identify her by her snaky skirt. Her face is partly skeletonized and de-fleshed. Her nose is missing, revealing the cavity. Yet she still has flesh on her lips, which are open to reveal bared teeth. Even with her head, this version of Coatlicue still seems intimidating to us today. But was she perceived as terrifying by the Aztecs or is this only a twenty-first century impression of her?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Terrifying and Respected</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Prior to the Spanish Conquest, Coatlicue related to other female earth deities, such as Toci (Our Grandmother). Several sixteenth-century Spanish Colonial sources&nbsp;mention that Coatlicue belonged to a class of deities known as <em>tzitzimime</em> (deities related to the stars), who were considered terrifying and dangerous. For example, outside of the 360-days that formed the agricultural calendar (called the year count or <em>xiuhpohualli</em>), there were five&nbsp;extra &ldquo;nameless&rdquo; days. The Aztecs believed this&nbsp;was an ominous time when bad things could happen. The <em>tzitzimime</em>, for instance, could descend to the earth&rsquo;s surface and eat people or at least wreak havoc, causing instability and fear. In Spanish Colonial chronicles, the <em>tzitzimime</em> are depicted with skeletonized faces and monster claws&mdash;similar to what we see in Coatlicue sculptures discussed here. These sources also call the <em>tzitzimime</em> demons or devils.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For all their ferociousness, however, the <em>tzitzimime</em>&nbsp;also had&nbsp;positive associations. Ironically,&nbsp;this&nbsp;group of deities were patrons of midwives, or women responsible for helping mothers with their babies. People also invoked them for medical help&nbsp;and they&nbsp;had associations with fertility. For these reasons, they had a more ambivalent role than as simply good or bad deities, and so they were both respected and feared.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Created, Buried, Found, Buried, Found Again</h3>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>Numerous snakes&nbsp;appear to writhe across the sculpture&rsquo;s surface. In fact, snakes form her entire skirt, as well as her belt and even her head. Coatlicue&rsquo;s name literally means Snakes-Her-Skirt, so her clothing helps&nbsp;identify her. Her snake belt ties at the waist to&nbsp;keep a skull &ldquo;buckle&rdquo; in place. Her upper torso is exposed, and we can just make out her breasts and rolls in her abdomen. The rolls indicate she is a mother. A sizable necklace formed of hands and hearts largely obscures her breasts.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two enormous snakes curl upwards from her neck to face one another. Their bifurcated, or split, tongues curl downwards, and the resulting effect is that the snake heads and tongues appear to be a single, forward-facing serpent face. Snakes coming out of body parts,&nbsp;as we see here, was an Aztec convention for squirting blood. Coatlicue has in fact been decapitated, and her snaky head represents the blood squirting from her severed neck. Her arms are also formed of snake heads, suggesting she was&nbsp;dismembered there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4363cb475d7f019850c0737c38ddd36704988a60.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Snakes facing one another (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt, 257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You might read elsewhere that Coatlicue was decapitated by her daughter or beheaded when her son was born from her severed neck (the idea has been adopted in part to explain this&nbsp;monumental sculpture). However, the myth from which this story derives does not actually state that Coatlicue suffered this fate. For this reason, it is useful to review the myth&mdash;one of the most important for the Aztecs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Battle atop Snake Mountain</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The primary myth in which Coatlicue is involved recounts the birth of the Aztec patron deity, Huitzilopochtli (pronounced &quot;wheat-zil-oh-poach-lee&quot;). This myth was recorded in the later sixteenth century after the Spanish Conquest of 1521.&nbsp;The main source from which we learn about it is the <em>General History of the Things of New Spain</em>, also called <em>The Florentine Codex </em>(written 1575&ndash;77 and compiled by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, indigenous authors and artists, and indigenous informants).[1]</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahagún, General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex), 1575–77, volume 1, page 420\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cc0858043f003a3d842f1cc2cb564a95483151c7.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Illustration of the Battle of Coatepec from Bernardino de Sahag&uacute;n, <em>General History of the Things of New Spain (The Florentine Codex)</em>, 1575&ndash;77, volume 1, page 420</span></span>One day Coatlicue, an earth goddess, was sweeping atop Coatepec (or Snake Mountain), when a feather fell into her apron. At that moment, she immaculately conceived a son, whose name was Huitzilopochtli (a sun and warrior god). Upon hearing that her mother was pregnant, Coyolxauhqui (or Bells-Her-Cheeks, pronounced &quot;coy-al-shauw-kee&quot;) became enraged. She rallied her 400 brothers, the <em>Centzonhuitz-nahua,</em>&nbsp;to storm Snake Mountain and kill their mother. One of the brothers decided to warn Coatlicue. Upon hearing of this impending murder, Coatlicue became understandably afraid. But Huitzilopochtli comforted her, telling her not to worry. At the moment Coyolxauhqui approached her mother, Huitzilopochtli was born, fully grown and armed. He sliced off his sister&rsquo;s head, and threw her body off the mountain. As she fell, her body broke apart until it came to rest&nbsp;at the bottom of Snake Mountain. But what became of Coatlicue, the mother to the victorious Huitzilopochtli and the defeated Coyolxauhqui? The myth does not mention her decapitation and dismemberment (only her daughter&rsquo;s), so why would this&nbsp;famous&nbsp;sculpture display her in this manner?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why was Coatlicue decapitated?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More recently, a new interpretation has been offered for Coatlicue&rsquo;s appearance that is based on another myth (recounted in different Spanish Colonial source) concerning the beginning of 5th era, or 5th sun.The Aztecs believed that there were four earlier suns (or eras) prior to the one in which we currently live. The myth notes that several female deities (perhaps Coatlicue among them), sacrificed themselves to put the sun in motion, effectively allowing time itself to continue. They were responsible for preserving the cosmos by offering their own lives.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt,  257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7245a7e2066f010d3debbb789296c8c86049d06d.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Snakes and torso (detail), Coatlicue, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), found on the SE edge of the Plaza mayor/Zocalo in Mexico City, basalt, 257 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After this point, these female deities were then symbolized by their skirts (called <em>mantas</em>), which could explain the careful attention paid to Coatlicue&rsquo;s snaky skirt. It functions as a reminder of her name&mdash;Snakes-Her-Skirt&mdash;as well as symbolizing&nbsp;her as a deity and&nbsp;reminding the viewer&nbsp;of her past deeds. This might also explain why&mdash;in place of her head&mdash;we have two snakes rising from her severed neck.&nbsp;They represent streaming blood, which was a precious liquid connoting fertility. With her willing sacrifice, Coatlicue enabled life to continue.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some details on the sculpture support this newer and enticing interpretation. There is a date glyph, 12 Reed, inscribed on the sculpture&rsquo;s back which might relate to the beginning of a new solar era. Archaeologists have also found the remains of several other monumental sculptures of female deities similar to Coatlicue, but each display different skirts. One of these sculptures (see photo at top of the page) stands near to Coatlicue in the Anthropology Museum, but hearts adorn her skirt instead of snakes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Coatlicue de Cozcatlán, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8f7c8d37b4ea61b5e1720fae09c36a7f8792f7ca.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coatlicue de Cozcatl&aacute;n, c. 1500, Mexica (Aztec), 115 cm high (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City)</span></span>Despite her fame in one of the most important Aztec myths concerning their patron god, Coatlicue did not have numerous stories recorded about her during the sixteenth century (that we know of at least). Few surviving Aztec objects display her. However, another stone sculpture in the National Museum of Anthropology&mdash;on a much smaller scale&mdash;shows Coatlicue with her head intact. We can identify her by her snaky skirt. Her face is partly skeletonized and de-fleshed. Her nose is missing, revealing the cavity. Yet she still has flesh on her lips, which are open to reveal bared teeth. Even with her head, this version of Coatlicue still seems intimidating to us today. But was she perceived as terrifying by the Aztecs or is this only a twenty-first century impression of her?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Terrifying and Respected</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Prior to the Spanish Conquest, Coatlicue related to other female earth deities, such as Toci (Our Grandmother). Several sixteenth-century Spanish Colonial sources&nbsp;mention that Coatlicue belonged to a class of deities known as <em>tzitzimime</em> (deities related to the stars), who were considered terrifying and dangerous. For example, outside of the 360-days that formed the agricultural calendar (called the year count or <em>xiuhpohualli</em>), there were five&nbsp;extra &ldquo;nameless&rdquo; days. The Aztecs believed this&nbsp;was an ominous time when bad things could happen. The <em>tzitzimime</em>, for instance, could descend to the earth&rsquo;s surface and eat people or at least wreak havoc, causing instability and fear. In Spanish Colonial chronicles, the <em>tzitzimime</em> are depicted with skeletonized faces and monster claws&mdash;similar to what we see in Coatlicue sculptures discussed here. These sources also call the <em>tzitzimime</em> demons or devils.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For all their ferociousness, however, the <em>tzitzimime</em>&nbsp;also had&nbsp;positive associations. Ironically,&nbsp;this&nbsp;group of deities were patrons of midwives, or women responsible for helping mothers with their babies. People also invoked them for medical help&nbsp;and they&nbsp;had associations with fertility. For these reasons, they had a more ambivalent role than as simply good or bad deities, and so they were both respected and feared.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Created, Buried, Found, Buried, Found Again</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After the Spanish Conquest, the monumental Coatlicue sculpture was buried because it was considered an inappropriate pagan idol by Spanish Christian invaders. After languishing in obscurity for more than 200 years, it was rediscovered in 1790.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Parchment&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For much of the Middle Ages dead cows were the main ingredient for books. What was frolicking in the meadow one month, may have been a page in a Bible the next. The skin of animals (calves, goats, sheep)&nbsp;was turned into parchment, which was subsequently cut into sheets. Parchment was introduced in late antiquity, when the codex (a&nbsp;book made of double leaves), was born and started to replace the papyrus scroll.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is a lot you can tell from medieval skin. Like a physician today, the book historian can make a diagnosis by observing it carefully. The quality of parchment&nbsp;sheets varied considerably. Like people today, not all medieval creatures had perfect skin. Some cows loved to rub against trees while&nbsp;others were particularly prone to insect bites. We can still see these defects today, which appear as tiny holes, gaps or dark patches&nbsp;as we read Saint Jerome or Chaucer.</p>\n"

A scribe producing a book for his own library may be less attentive than one that worked in a monastic community. The best sheets have a deep-white color, with a hint of yellow. They feel like velvet and make a slight rustling sound when you turn the page&mdash;suspenseful whispers that teased the reader (image above). Bad skin, by contrast, crackles. It is of uneven thickness, and shows staining and a variety of colors (image below). Unlike what you may have thought, looking at imperfect skin is far more interesting than studying its perfect counterpart. This is because a defect tells a powerful story, shedding light on the book&rsquo;s production and providing clues about its use and storage post-production.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Medieval craftsmen were well aware of the varying quality of animal skins, which they used as the basis for their books. However, calves, sheep or goats that had given up their livelihood and skin for the sake of medieval readers were not always to blame&mdash;and neither were the scribes.&nbsp;The most common imperfections are holes produced by the knife of the parchment maker.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Preparing parchment was a delicate business. In order to clear the skin of flesh and hair, it was attached to a wooden frame, tight like a drum. If the round knife of the parchment maker (the lunellum) cut too deep during this scraping process, elongated rips or holes would appear. &nbsp;A small puncture easily became a gaping hole. The art of preparing animal skin was to apply just the right amount of pressure.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, readers did not seem to mind the holes too much and scribes usually just wrote around them, or they repaired them. Sometimes&nbsp;the reader is given an unexpected sneak peek onto the next page&mdash;where a dragon may just be introduced into the story (as in the image above).&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Repairing holes was sometimes done more eloquently. In the manuscript above,&nbsp;the hole&nbsp;is&nbsp;not made to disappear, but it is highlighted by colored threads.

"\n"
"<p>Another skin problem encountered by scribes during a book&rsquo;s production was the animal&rsquo;s hair follicle&mdash;the skin organ that produces hair (seen above). These follicles show as pronounced black dots on the white page. Often parchment makers or scribes were able to sand them away, producing the desired smooth and cream-colored surface. However, if the follicles had been too deep in a calf or sheep, no dermatologist could have removed the imperfection, let alone the blunt instruments of the scribe. The only thing to do was to write around the patch. The follicles are helpful because they allow us to determine&mdash; from the distance between them&mdash;whether the animal was a calf, a sheep or a goat. This, in turn, may shed light on where the manuscript was produced: the use of goat, for example, often points to Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The transition to paper</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 12th century another material appeared in Europe: paper. Imported from Arabic culture, it was first exclusively used for documentary purposes, such as account books and letters. In a remarkable shift of scribal practices, in the fourteenth century scribes all over Europe started to use paper for manuscripts. Conservative scribes, such as monks, ignored the new material for some time, while others&mdash;especially those who wanted to economize&mdash;embraced it. Paper and parchment were used for all sorts of manuscripts, from chunky volumes to small portable&nbsp;books.</p>\n"

"<h3>Parchment&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For much of the Middle Ages dead cows were the main ingredient for books. What was frolicking in the meadow one month, may have been a page in a Bible the next. The skin of animals (calves, goats, sheep)&nbsp;was turned into parchment, which was subsequently cut into sheets. Parchment was introduced in late antiquity, when the codex (a&nbsp;book made of double leaves), was born and started to replace the papyrus scroll.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is a lot you can tell from medieval skin. Like a physician today, the book historian can make a diagnosis by observing it carefully. The quality of parchment&nbsp;sheets varied considerably. Like people today, not all medieval creatures had perfect skin. Some cows loved to rub against trees while&nbsp;others were particularly prone to insect bites. We can still see these defects today, which appear as tiny holes, gaps or dark patches&nbsp;as we read Saint Jerome or Chaucer.</p>\n"

Paris Bible, The Hague, Royal Library, MS 132 F 21,&nbsp;mid 13th century&nbsp;</span></span>The quality of the page also had a lot to do with preparation. A scribe producing a book for his own library may be less attentive than one that worked in a monastic community. The best sheets have a deep-white color, with a hint of yellow. They feel like velvet and make a slight rustling sound when you turn the page&mdash;suspenseful whispers that teased the reader (image above). Bad skin, by contrast, crackles. It is of uneven thickness, and shows staining and a variety of colors (image below). Unlike what you may have thought, looking at imperfect skin is far more interesting than studying its perfect counterpart. This is because a defect tells a powerful story, shedding light on the book&rsquo;s production and providing clues about its use and storage post-production.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Medieval craftsmen were well aware of the varying quality of animal skins, which they used as the basis for their books. However, calves, sheep or goats that had given up their livelihood and skin for the sake of medieval readers were not always to blame&mdash;and neither were the scribes.&nbsp;The most common imperfections are holes produced by the knife of the parchment maker.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Preparing parchment was a delicate business. In order to clear the skin of flesh and hair, it was attached to a wooden frame, tight like a drum. If the round knife of the parchment maker (the lunellum) cut too deep during this scraping process, elongated rips or holes would appear. &nbsp;A small puncture easily became a gaping hole. The art of preparing animal skin was to apply just the right amount of pressure.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, readers did not seem to mind the holes too much and scribes usually just wrote around them, or they repaired them. Sometimes&nbsp;the reader is given an unexpected sneak peek onto the next page&mdash;where a dragon may just be introduced into the story (as in the image above).&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Another skin problem encountered by scribes during a book&rsquo;s production was the animal&rsquo;s hair follicle&mdash;the skin organ that produces hair (seen above). These follicles show as pronounced black dots on the white page. Often parchment makers or scribes were able to sand them away, producing the desired smooth and cream-colored surface. However, if the follicles had been too deep in a calf or sheep, no dermatologist could have removed the imperfection, let alone the blunt instruments of the scribe. The only thing to do was to write around the patch. The follicles are helpful because they allow us to determine&mdash; from the distance between them&mdash;whether the animal was a calf, a sheep or a goat. This, in turn, may shed light on where the manuscript was produced: the use of goat, for example, often points to Italy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The transition to paper</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the 12th century another material appeared in Europe: paper. Imported from Arabic culture, it was first exclusively used for documentary purposes, such as account books and letters. In a remarkable shift of scribal practices, in the fourteenth century scribes all over Europe started to use paper for manuscripts. Conservative scribes, such as monks, ignored the new material for some time, while others&mdash;especially those who wanted to economize&mdash;embraced it. Paper and parchment were used for all sorts of manuscripts, from chunky volumes to small portable&nbsp;books.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>A new city</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Seventh-century North Africa was not the easiest place to establish a new city. It required battling Byzantines; convincing Berbers, the indigenous people of North Africa, to accept centralized Muslim rule; and persuading Middle Eastern merchants to move to North Africa. So, in 670 CE, conquering general Sidi Okba constructed a Friday Mosque (<em>masjid-i jami`</em>&nbsp;or<em>&nbsp;jami`</em>) in what was becoming Kairouan in modern day Tunisia. A Friday Mosque is used for communal prayers on the Muslim holy day, Friday. The mosque was a critical addition, communicating that Kairouan would become a cosmopolitan metropolis under strong Muslim control, an important distinction at this time and place.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan, it is an early example of a hypostyle mosque that also reflects how pre-Islamic and eastern Islamic art and motifs were incorporated into the religious architecture of Islamic North Africa. The aesthetics signified the Great Mosque and Kairouan, and, thus, its patrons, were just as important as the religious structures, cities, and rulers of other empires in this region, and that Kairouan was part of the burgeoning Islamic empire.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Aghlabids</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the eighth century, Sidi Okba&rsquo;s mosque was rebuilt at least twice as Kairouan prospered. However, the mosque we see today is essentially ninth century. The Aghlabids (800-909 C.E.) were the semi-independent rulers of much of North Africa. In 836, Prince Ziyadat Allah I tore down most of the earlier mudbrick structure and rebuilt it in more permanent stone, brick, and wood. The prayer hall or sanctuary is supported by rows of columns and there is an open courtyard, that are characteristic of a hypostyle plan.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Great Mosque of Kairouan prayer hall facade (photo: Damian Entwistle, CC BY-SA 2.0)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/1dd5094c4cfec6ef3f5a0f9786bd45098672d9b1.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Great Mosque of Kairouan prayer hall facade (photo: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Great_Mosque_of_Kairouan_prayer_hall_facade.jpg\">Damian Entwistle</a>, CC BY-SA 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the late ninth century, another Aghlabid ruler embellished the courtyard entrance to the prayer space and added a dome over the central arches and portal. The dome emphasizes the placement of the mihrab, or prayer niche (below), which is on the same central axis and also under a cupola to signify its importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The drum rests on squinches, small arches decorated with shell over rosette designs similar to examples in Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad Islamic art. The stone dome is constructed of twenty four ribs that each have a small corbel at their base, so the dome looks like a cut cantaloupe, according to the architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell.</p>\n"

Like other hypostyle mosques, such as the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque in Medina, the mosque of Kairouan is roughly rectangular. Wider aisles leading to the mihrab and along the qibla wall give it a T-plan.

"<p>Since it was used for Friday prayer, the mosque has a ninth-century minbar, a narrow wooden pulpit where the weekly sermon was delivered. It is said to be the oldest surviving wooden minbar. Like Christian pulpits, the minbar made the prayer leader more visible and audible. Because a ruler&rsquo;s legitimacy could rest upon the mention of his name during the sermon, the minbar served both religious and secular purposes. The minbar is made from teak imported from Asia, an expensive material exemplifying Kairouan&rsquo;s commercial reach. The side of the minbar closest to the mihrab is composed of elaborately carved latticework with vegetal, floral, and geometric designs evocative of those used in Byzantine and Umayyad architecture.</p>\n"

Perhaps inspired by Roman lighthouses, the massive square Kairouan minaret is about thirty two meters tall, over one hundred feet, making it one of the highest structures around. So in addition to functioning as a place to call for prayer, the minaret identifies the mosque&rsquo;s presence and location in the city while helping to define the city&rsquo;s religious identity. As it was placed just off the mihrab axis, it also affirmed the mihrab&rsquo;s importance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mosque continued to be modified after the Aghlabids, showing that it remained religiously and socially significant even as Kairouan fell into decline. A Zirid, al-Mu&lsquo;izz ibn Badis (ruled 1016-62 CE), commissioned a wooden maqsura, an enclosed space within a mosque that was reserved for the ruler and his associates. The maqsura is assembled from cutwork wooden screens topped with bands of carved abstracted vegetal motifs set into geometric frames, kufic-style script inscriptions, and merlons, which look like the crenellations a top a fortress wall. Maqsuras are said to indicate political instability in a society. They remove a ruler from the rest of the worshippers. So, the enclosure, along with its inscription, protected the lives and affirmed the status of persons allowed inside.</p>\n"

In 1294, Caliph al-Mustansir restored the courtyard and added monumental portals, such as Bab al-Ma on the east and the domed Bab Lalla Rejana on the west. Additional gates were constructed in later centuries. Carved stone panels inside the mosque and on the exterior acted like billboards advertising which patron was responsible for construction and restoration.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<h3>An intellectual center</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Great Mosque was literally and figuratively at the center of Kairouan activity, growth, and prestige. Though the mosque is now near the northwest city ramparts established in the eleventh century, when Sidi Okba founded Kairouan, it was probably closer to the center of town, near what was the governor&rsquo;s residence and the main thoroughfare, a symbolically prominent and physical visible part of the city. By the mid-tenth century, Kairouan became a thriving settlement with marketplaces, agriculture imported from surrounding towns, cisterns supplying water, and textile and ceramic manufacturing areas. It was a political capital, a pilgrimage city, and intellectual center, particularly for the Maliki school of Sunni Islam and the sciences. The Great Mosque had fifteen thoroughfares leading from it into a city that may have had a circular layout like Baghdad, the capital of the Islamic empire during Kairouan&rsquo;s heyday. As a Friday Mosque, it was one of if not the largest buildings in town.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3><span>A new city</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Seventh-century North Africa was not the easiest place to establish a new city. It required battling Byzantines; convincing Berbers, the indigenous people of North Africa, to accept centralized Muslim rule; and persuading Middle Eastern merchants to move to North Africa. So, in 670 CE, conquering general Sidi Okba constructed a Friday Mosque (<em>masjid-i jami`</em>&nbsp;or<em>&nbsp;jami`</em>) in what was becoming Kairouan in modern day Tunisia. A Friday Mosque is used for communal prayers on the Muslim holy day, Friday. The mosque was a critical addition, communicating that Kairouan would become a cosmopolitan metropolis under strong Muslim control, an important distinction at this time and place.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan, it is an early example of a hypostyle mosque that also reflects how pre-Islamic and eastern Islamic art and motifs were incorporated into the religious architecture of Islamic North Africa. The aesthetics signified the Great Mosque and Kairouan, and, thus, its patrons, were just as important as the religious structures, cities, and rulers of other empires in this region, and that Kairouan was part of the burgeoning Islamic empire.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Aghlabids</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the eighth century, Sidi Okba&rsquo;s mosque was rebuilt at least twice as Kairouan prospered. However, the mosque we see today is essentially ninth century. The Aghlabids (800-909 C.E.) were the semi-independent rulers of much of North Africa. In 836, Prince Ziyadat Allah I tore down most of the earlier mudbrick structure and rebuilt it in more permanent stone, brick, and wood. The prayer hall or sanctuary is supported by rows of columns and there is an open courtyard, that are characteristic of a hypostyle plan.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<p>In the late ninth century, another Aghlabid ruler embellished the courtyard entrance to the prayer space and added a dome over the central arches and portal. The dome emphasizes the placement of the mihrab, or prayer niche (below), which is on the same central axis and also under a cupola to signify its importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The drum rests on squinches, small arches decorated with shell over rosette designs similar to examples in Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad Islamic art. The stone dome is constructed of twenty four ribs that each have a small corbel at their base, so the dome looks like a cut cantaloupe, according to the architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell.</p>\n"

"<p><span>Other architectural elements link the Great Mosque of Kairouan with earlier and contemporary Islamic religious structures and pre-Islamic buildings. They also show the joint religious and secular importance of the Great Mosque of Kairouan. Like other hypostyle mosques, such as the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque in Medina, the mosque of Kairouan is roughly rectangular. Wider aisles leading to the mihrab and along the qibla wall give it a T-plan. The sanctuary roof and courtyard porticos are supported by repurposed Roman and Byzantine columns and capitals.</span></p>\n"

"<p>Since it was used for Friday prayer, the mosque has a ninth-century minbar, a narrow wooden pulpit where the weekly sermon was delivered. It is said to be the oldest surviving wooden minbar. Like Christian pulpits, the minbar made the prayer leader more visible and audible. Because a ruler&rsquo;s legitimacy could rest upon the mention of his name during the sermon, the minbar served both religious and secular purposes. The minbar is made from teak imported from Asia, an expensive material exemplifying Kairouan&rsquo;s commercial reach. The side of the minbar closest to the mihrab is composed of elaborately carved latticework with vegetal, floral, and geometric designs evocative of those used in Byzantine and Umayyad architecture.</p>\n"

Perhaps inspired by Roman lighthouses, the massive square Kairouan minaret is about thirty two meters tall, over one hundred feet, making it one of the highest structures around. So in addition to functioning as a place to call for prayer, the minaret identifies the mosque&rsquo;s presence and location in the city while helping to define the city&rsquo;s religious identity. As it was placed just off the mihrab axis, it also affirmed the mihrab&rsquo;s importance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mosque continued to be modified after the Aghlabids, showing that it remained religiously and socially significant even as Kairouan fell into decline. A Zirid, al-Mu&lsquo;izz ibn Badis (ruled 1016-62 CE), commissioned a wooden maqsura, an enclosed space within a mosque that was reserved for the ruler and his associates. The maqsura is assembled from cutwork wooden screens topped with bands of carved abstracted vegetal motifs set into geometric frames, kufic-style script inscriptions, and merlons, which look like the crenellations a top a fortress wall. Maqsuras are said to indicate political instability in a society. They remove a ruler from the rest of the worshippers. So, the enclosure, along with its inscription, protected the lives and affirmed the status of persons allowed inside.</p>\n"

In 1294, Caliph al-Mustansir restored the courtyard and added monumental portals, such as Bab al-Ma on the east and the domed Bab Lalla Rejana on the west. Additional gates were constructed in later centuries. Carved stone panels inside the mosque and on the exterior acted like billboards advertising which patron was responsible for construction and restoration.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An intellectual center</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Great Mosque was literally and figuratively at the center of Kairouan activity, growth, and prestige. Though the mosque is now near the northwest city ramparts established in the eleventh century, when Sidi Okba founded Kairouan, it was probably closer to the center of town, near what was the governor&rsquo;s residence and the main thoroughfare, a symbolically prominent and physical visible part of the city. By the mid-tenth century, Kairouan became a thriving settlement with marketplaces, agriculture imported from surrounding towns, cisterns supplying water, and textile and ceramic manufacturing areas. It was a political capital, a pilgrimage city, and intellectual center, particularly for the Maliki school of Sunni Islam and the sciences. The Great Mosque had fifteen thoroughfares leading from it into a city that may have had a circular layout like Baghdad, the capital of the Islamic empire during Kairouan&rsquo;s heyday. As a Friday Mosque, it was one of if not the largest buildings in town.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Even today, the Great Mosque of Kairouan reflects the time and place in which it was built.</p>\n"

"<p>We are used to having multiple books open at the same time when looking things up at home or writing an essay for class. Whether PDFs, e-books or good-old-fashioned paper volumes, switching between books in a smooth movement is something we don&rsquo;t often think about. This was very different in medieval times. In those days, books tended to resist when you tried to move them: they were as heavy as a brick and easily twice that size. A related problem was one of space. The average medieval book has a wingspan of at least half a meter wide when open. Consequently, comfortably placing two books in front of you was a stretch, let alone multiple volumes. In an early-sixteenth-century depiction of Erasmus, the scholar cannot even place a single book on his desk as he is writing a letter (above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Interestingly, the challenges of medieval book consultation stands in stark contrast with what we know about reading and studying in the period. We know that readers were&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in learning different points of view with respect to their topic of inquiry, and so&nbsp;browsed through a great number of volumes at the same time. Sparked by this contradiction, this article explores medieval desktops. How many books are being consulted at the same time in medieval depictions of reading? How are the objects laid out across the available space? In short, how are we to understand the logistics behind the devouring of knowledge in the last four centuries of the Middle Ages? As will become clear, the answers to these questions vary greatly depending on why an individual handled multiple books at the same time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Scribes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first group of individuals who had to manage multiple books were scribes. By definition, a scribe had to have at least two books on his desk: the one he was making (a growing pile of quires, which remained unbound until the very end) and the one he was copying from (called the &ldquo;exemplar&rdquo;). While keeping track of the loose quires may have been challenging, of the groups discussed here scribes had it the easiest. After all, the individual was only technically reading one book&mdash;the one he was copying from. This explains why their deskspace was of limited size, at least judging from surviving depictions.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In most cases their working space was erect rather than flat. The&nbsp;famous image of Jean Mi&eacute;lot at work (above) shows how the desktop of the scribe had a 45-degree angle, resulting in an almost erect surface. Clearly visible is also a vertical orientation in the line-up of the books: one was placed above the other. In fact, the desktop in this image is split in half, with the lower half containing the book under production, as well as the scribe&rsquo;s tools (ink pots and pens), while the upper half holds the exemplar. Mi&eacute;lot obviously needed to go shopping for a larger desk, because we see books laying around on the ground and on a bench.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Miniature of the translator, Simon de Hesdin, at work in his study, Valerius Maximus, translated by Simon de Hesdin and Nicholas de Gonesse, Facta et dicta memorabilia, 1479, London, British Library, Royal 18 E III, f. 24 \n"

Although the books are out of sight, the desk clearly provides room for two books. However, they placed next to one another. This may be specially done for the task of a translator, who needed to carefully read the source text and subsequently scribbling down the translation in loose quires or on loose sheets. This way, both books would be right before him: there was no need to look up at a high book platform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Readers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is easy to find images of scribes with a desk full of books, it is less common to encounter readers in similar situations. That is to say: there are very few medieval scenes in which someone is reading but not writing&mdash;where books are present but pens are not. In part, this has to do with medieval study practices. Readers would usually have a pen nearby even when they were just reading. After all, remarks and critiques needed to be added to the margin at the spur of the moment. &ldquo;Penless&rdquo; images, while rare, often show a crowded desktop. The image&nbsp;below&nbsp;shows Christine de Pisan (a late medieval author) browsing multiple books at a big desk.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Brussels, Bibliothèque, Royale, MS 9009-11\n"

"\n"
"<p>The absence of the pen may result from an urge to depict Christine as an avid reader. This is emphasized, I think, by the various volumes that lay open&mdash;note how some open books are facing down, the way we still do today!

"<p>We are used to having multiple books open at the same time when looking things up at home or writing an essay for class. Whether PDFs, e-books or good-old-fashioned paper volumes, switching between books in a smooth movement is something we don&rsquo;t often think about. This was very different in medieval times. In those days, books tended to resist when you tried to move them: they were as heavy as a brick and easily twice that size. A related problem was one of space. The average medieval book has a wingspan of at least half a meter wide when open. Consequently, comfortably placing two books in front of you was a stretch, let alone multiple volumes. In an early-sixteenth-century depiction of Erasmus, the scholar cannot even place a single book on his desk as he is writing a letter (above).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Interestingly, the challenges of medieval book consultation stands in stark contrast with what we know about reading and studying in the period. We know that readers were&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in learning different points of view with respect to their topic of inquiry, and so&nbsp;browsed through a great number of volumes at the same time. Sparked by this contradiction, this article explores medieval desktops. How many books are being consulted at the same time in medieval depictions of reading? How are the objects laid out across the available space? In short, how are we to understand the logistics behind the devouring of knowledge in the last four centuries of the Middle Ages? As will become clear, the answers to these questions vary greatly depending on why an individual handled multiple books at the same time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Scribes</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The first group of individuals who had to manage multiple books were scribes. By definition, a scribe had to have at least two books on his desk: the one he was making (a growing pile of quires, which remained unbound until the very end) and the one he was copying from (called the &ldquo;exemplar&rdquo;). While keeping track of the loose quires may have been challenging, of the groups discussed here scribes had it the easiest. After all, the individual was only technically reading one book&mdash;the one he was copying from. This explains why their deskspace was of limited size, at least judging from surviving depictions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Buonaccorso of Pistoia, of true nobility Debate, Jean Le Tavernier, illuminator, Jean Miélot in his study, after 1450, Brussels, KBR, ms. 9278-80 f. 10\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b899b9fbb99460fd47bbe8e20e0d342194a2aba5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Jean Le Tavernier (illuminator), Jean Mi&eacute;lot in his study, after 1450, Buonaccorso of Pistoia,&nbsp;Brussels, Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, MS 9278-80, fol. 10r</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In most cases their working space was erect rather than flat. The&nbsp;famous image of Jean Mi&eacute;lot at work (above) shows how the desktop of the scribe had a 45-degree angle, resulting in an almost erect surface. Clearly visible is also a vertical orientation in the line-up of the books: one was placed above the other. In fact, the desktop in this image is split in half, with the lower half containing the book under production, as well as the scribe&rsquo;s tools (ink pots and pens), while the upper half holds the exemplar. Mi&eacute;lot obviously needed to go shopping for a larger desk, because we see books laying around on the ground and on a bench.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\" \n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f18742a8b64a8858c5284674ac96de80e1aa5b22.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Miniature of the translator, Simon de Hesdin, at work in his study, Valerius Maximus, translated by Simon de Hesdin and Nicholas de Gonesse, <em>Facta et dicta memorabilia</em>, 1479, London, British Library, Royal MS 18 E. III, fol. 24r</span></span>Interestingly, there are also desks with a horizontal orientation. The image at the left shows the translator Simon de Hesdin at work. Although the books are out of sight, the desk clearly provides room for two books. However, they placed next to one another. This may be specially done for the task of a translator, who needed to carefully read the source text and subsequently scribbling down the translation in loose quires or on loose sheets. This way, both books would be right before him: there was no need to look up at a high book platform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Readers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is easy to find images of scribes with a desk full of books, it is less common to encounter readers in similar situations. That is to say: there are very few medieval scenes in which someone is reading but not writing&mdash;where books are present but pens are not. In part, this has to do with medieval study practices. Readers would usually have a pen nearby even when they were just reading. After all, remarks and critiques needed to be added to the margin at the spur of the moment. &ldquo;Penless&rdquo; images, while rare, often show a crowded desktop. The image&nbsp;below&nbsp;shows Christine de Pisan (a late medieval author) browsing multiple books at a big desk.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Brussels, Bibliothèque, Royale, MS 9009-11\n"

"\n"
"<p>The absence of the pen may result from an urge to depict Christine as an avid reader. This is emphasized, I think, by the various volumes that lay open&mdash;note how some open books are facing down, the way we still do today! From the late medieval period a special tool was available for readers who did not like the clutter shown on Christine&rsquo;s desk: the book carousel.</p>\n"

"<h3>Carpet weaving in the Islamic world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are woven works of art that were produced at every level of society in the Islamic world. Women have been weaving for centuries in villages and nomadic encampments all over the Middle East, Anatolia, and Central Asia, each woman passing down her techniques and designs to her daughters. These women created carpets both for sale and for their own personal use, and this tradition continues today.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Carpets were also made in the royal courts of the Islamic world. These carpets were not just functional floor coverings, they were ornate works of art that indicated the status and wealth of their owners. Court carpets were used on the floors in reception halls, audience chambers, and at court-supported religious institutions. They were also presented as impressive gifts to other rulers. Manuscript paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries suggest smaller rugs were often layered on top of larger carpets and also show that many carpets were used in outdoor pleasure pavilions and palatial parks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rulers had access to expensive materials, such as silk and metal-wrapped threads, and employed the most highly skilled designers and weavers in their empires to create enormous and luxurious carpets. Because of their quality, design, and skilled execution, court carpets are among the finest examples of art from the Islamic world. Court carpets are often very different from the carpets made in commercial workshops or villages. Rather than solely utilizing centuries-old traditional motifs, court carpets often share designs found on a range of media, such as bookbinding and manuscript painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although carpets were made in many royal courts, the Ottoman (1281&ndash;1924), the Safavid (1501&ndash;1732), and the Mughal (1526&ndash;1858) Empires provide some of the richest examples of royally produced carpets.</p>\n"

"<p>The Ottoman Empire originated in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), and was one of the largest and longest lived in the Islamic world. It controlling territories that reached from North Africa to Eastern Europe from 1299 until 1923. Anatolia has a long tradition of carpet weaving, but from the 16th century onward Ottoman court carpets utilized a set of specific designs created by the artists of the Ottoman court workshops, designs that were also used on the court ceramics, paintings, bookbindings, and textiles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the most popular of these was the &ldquo;saz&nbsp;style,&rdquo; which is characterized by long sinuous leaves, and stylized flowers (see below). Court artists also developed the &ldquo;floral style,&rdquo; where we see more naturalistic depictions of flowers such as tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths, among others. The floral and&nbsp;saz&nbsp;styles were sometimes used alone and sometimes used together, along with other motifs like the cintamani pattern (usually a combination of pearl-like circles accompanied by wavy lines sometimes called &quot;tiger stripes&quot;), on a huge variety of objects designed by the court, including ceramics, silks, carpets, and manuscripts.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Both the&nbsp;saz&nbsp;and floral styles appear on this rare Ottoman court prayer rug. The jagged-edged&nbsp;saz&nbsp;leaves gracefully undulate in the border amongst carnations, tulips, and other flowers. The arch at the center of the carpet identifies this as a prayer rug, and symbolizes both amihrab&nbsp;(from mosque architecture) and a gateway to paradise. Such rugs were, and are, used by Muslims during the five daily prayers prescribed in Islam. Though one can go to mosque during the prayer times, prayer can take place anywhere so long as there is a clean surface (provided by the rug) and water for ritual cleansing. A luxurious prayer rug like this would have belonged to a very wealthy court patron.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of this remarkable carpet, the prototype for later designs, may be based on the slender-columned architecture of Muslim Spain. When Muslims and Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, many exiles settled in the Ottoman Empire, bringing with them their own visual culture, which, in turn, influenced Ottoman art. This dual-columned design spawned an entire genre of architecturally-inspired prayer rugs across Anatolia.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Ottoman court carpets is their unusual structure. Unlike all other Turkish carpets, Ottoman court carpets use S-spun wool, which is typical only of carpets woven in Egypt. Scholars attribute this unusual feature to the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, after which the Ottoman court commissioned carpets from Egyptian workshops and had Egyptian weavers and Egyptian wool sent to Turkey for their own use.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Contemporaneous manuscript illustrations shed light on how carpets were used at the court. Though we must remember that paintings are not photographs, and that artists may have invented much in their scenes, paintings like this can nevertheless tell us about the status of carpets in the court. In this painting, ordered by Sultan Murad III, a Safavid dignitary is presented to the Ottoman sultan against the backdrop of a magnificent red and blue Ushak medallion carpet. The painting shows how carpets were used as decorative and symbolic backdrops to Ottoman court rituals.

"<p><span>Carpets intended for religious settings, like the Ardabil carpet, display non-figural decoration such as scrolling vines, flower motifs, calligraphy, and&nbsp;shamsas(sunbursts). Carpets made for secular settings, like the court&rsquo;s palaces and pleasure pavilions, display a wider range of motifs, encompassing the designs found on carpets like the Ardabil, but also sometimes including animals, hunting scenes, human figures, and even angels.</span></p>\n"

"<p>The carpet left is a remarkable example of a secular Safavid court carpet. It was woven entirely of silk, and its bright field is filled with animals&mdash;some real, like lions and rams, and others entirely fantastical. The animals, some of which are engaged in intense combat, are set amoungst a lush backdrop of stylized flowers and trees. The popularity of animal and hunting scenes was well established in Iran; hunting was considered a princely pastime in Iran even before the advent of Islam, and continued as a widely used subject in Safavid art.</p>\n"

"<h3>Carpet weaving in the Islamic world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Carpets are woven works of art that were produced at every level of society in the Islamic world. Women have been weaving for centuries in villages and nomadic encampments all over the Middle East, Anatolia, and Central Asia, each woman passing down her techniques and designs to her daughters. These women created carpets both for sale and for their own personal use, and this tradition continues today.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Carpets were also made in the royal courts of the Islamic world. These carpets were not just functional floor coverings, they were ornate works of art that indicated the status and wealth of their owners. Court carpets were used on the floors in reception halls, audience chambers, and at court-supported religious institutions. They were also presented as impressive gifts to other rulers. Manuscript paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries suggest smaller rugs were often layered on top of larger carpets and also show that many carpets were used in outdoor pleasure pavilions and palatial parks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Rulers had access to expensive materials, such as silk and metal-wrapped threads, and employed the most highly skilled designers and weavers in their empires to create enormous and luxurious carpets. Because of their quality, design, and skilled execution, court carpets are among the finest examples of art from the Islamic world. Court carpets are often very different from the carpets made in commercial workshops or villages. Rather than solely utilizing centuries-old traditional motifs, court carpets often share designs found on a range of media, such as bookbinding and manuscript painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although carpets were made in many royal courts, the Ottoman (1281&ndash;1924), the Safavid (1501&ndash;1732), and the Mughal (1526&ndash;1858) Empires provide some of the richest examples of royally produced carpets.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Ottoman Empire originated in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), and was one of the largest and longest lived in the Islamic world. It controlling territories that reached from North Africa to Eastern Europe from 1299 until 1923. Anatolia has a long tradition of carpet weaving, but from the 16th century onward Ottoman court carpets utilized a set of specific designs created by the artists of the Ottoman court workshops, designs that were also used on the court ceramics, paintings, bookbindings, and textiles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the most popular of these was the &ldquo;saz&nbsp;style,&rdquo; which is characterized by long sinuous leaves, and stylized flowers (see below). Court artists also developed the &ldquo;floral style,&rdquo; where we see more naturalistic depictions of flowers such as tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths, among others. The floral and&nbsp;saz&nbsp;styles were sometimes used alone and sometimes used together, along with other motifs like the cintamani pattern (usually a combination of pearl-like circles accompanied by wavy lines sometimes called &quot;tiger stripes&quot;), on a huge variety of objects designed by the court, including ceramics, silks, carpets, and manuscripts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Border detail (note the long curving saz style leaves, a pair of white tulips facing downward, and branches of small white hyacinth blossoms\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2f47a838e61775cd192add9d9e670968fd9b3295.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Border detail (note the long curving saz style leaves, a pair of white tulips facing downward, and branches of small white hyacinth blossoms</span></span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Both the&nbsp;saz&nbsp;and floral styles appear on this rare Ottoman court prayer rug. The jagged-edged&nbsp;saz&nbsp;leaves gracefully undulate in the border amongst carnations, tulips, and other flowers. The arch at the center of the carpet identifies this as a prayer rug, and symbolizes both amihrab&nbsp;(from mosque architecture) and a gateway to paradise. Such rugs were, and are, used by Muslims during the five daily prayers prescribed in Islam. Though one can go to mosque during the prayer times, prayer can take place anywhere so long as there is a clean surface (provided by the rug) and water for ritual cleansing. A luxurious prayer rug like this would have belonged to a very wealthy court patron.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The design of this remarkable carpet, the prototype for later designs, may be based on the slender-columned architecture of Muslim Spain. When Muslims and Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, many exiles settled in the Ottoman Empire, bringing with them their own visual culture, which, in turn, influenced Ottoman art. This dual-columned design spawned an entire genre of architecturally-inspired prayer rugs across Anatolia.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Ottoman court carpets is their unusual structure. Unlike all other Turkish carpets, Ottoman court carpets use S-spun wool, which is typical only of carpets woven in Egypt. Scholars attribute this unusual feature to the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, after which the Ottoman court commissioned carpets from Egyptian workshops and had Egyptian weavers and Egyptian wool sent to Turkey for their own use.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Contemporaneous manuscript illustrations shed light on how carpets were used at the court. Though we must remember that paintings are not photographs, and that artists may have invented much in their scenes, paintings like this can nevertheless tell us about the status of carpets in the court. In this painting, ordered by Sultan Murad III, a Safavid dignitary is presented to the Ottoman sultan against the backdrop of a magnificent red and blue Ushak medallion carpet. The painting shows how carpets were used as decorative and symbolic backdrops to Ottoman court rituals. Not only does the carpet provide a sumptuous setting for the ceremony, it also sends a message to the Safavids (political rivals of the Ottomans) about the wealth of the Ottoman court. We can imagine how such a carpet was used to demonstrate to visitors the power, culture, and artistic accomplishments of the Ottomans.</span></p>\n"

"<p>When you think of Hell, what images fill your imagination? &nbsp;Your mind might first conjure up a monstrous satanic figure, and then you may further fill in the picture with other beastly devils that roam around torturing damned sinners, who in turn cry out with pain and regret.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>And how about the better parts of the Christian&nbsp;afterlife; how do you imagine them? Perhaps the saved are singing songs of joy, angels are fluttering about, and throngs of holy men and women converse and worship God. &nbsp;To some degree, such imaginings have their origins in the Bible. However, in the Christian West, conceptions of the afterlife evolved quite a bit over the centuries. One important late medieval figure who played a key role in shaping the cultural concepts of life after death&mdash;even to the present day&mdash;is Dante Alighieri, the Florentine poet who was born in the 1260s and died in 1321.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his epic poem known as the<em> Divine Comedy</em>, Dante creates a fictional version of himself who&nbsp;travels through the farthest reaches of&nbsp;hell <em>(Inferno)</em>, purgatory<em> (Purgatorio)</em>&nbsp;and paradise<em> (Paradiso)</em>. Many details that he describes along this journey have left a lasting impression on the Western imagination for more than half a millennium. &nbsp;In fact, the rather stereotypical images of the afterlife I described earlier are all represented in his work. But Dante also&nbsp;found novel ways to portray already well-formed concepts, thus further solidifying them while also reshaping them into new guises that would become&nbsp;familiar to countless generations that followed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Because of Dante&#39;s image-driven descriptions, many artists have sought to illustrate his text through a wide variety of media. &nbsp;Almost immediately after his work was completed, illuminators created images to accompany manuscripts of his masterpiece. More than forty illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em> were created before the advent of the printing press (in the late 15th century). &nbsp;When the potential&nbsp;for faster reproductions of books&mdash;including illustrated books&mdash;became a reality, Dante&#39;s imagination, sometimes intertwined with the imagination of an artist rendering a visual interpretation of his words, reached an even larger audience than before. &nbsp;We will look here at two outstanding examples of how Dante&#39;s words fed the creative imagination of visual artists before and shortly after the invention of the printing press. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The influence of art on Dante&#39;s world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before looking at Dante&#39;s influence on the visual arts, however, we need take a little step back in time. &nbsp;The relationship between Dante and the arts was a reciprocal one; images he had seen also greatly influenced his literary vision. Were there any sights, sounds or works of art you saw as a child that you can still easily call to mind today? If you were writing a fictional story that relied heavily on your own imagination, could you see yourself drawing from these vivid sensorial experiences and making them a part of that story? This was the case for Dante.</p>\n"

"<p>Florence was full of artistic marvels well before the Renaissance. &nbsp;Incredible works of art and architecture filled the city well before Dante&#39;s birth in late medieval times. The Florence Baptistery (illustrated above), which Dante fondly referred to in his <em>Comedy</em> as his &quot;bel (beautiful) San Giovanni,&quot;&nbsp;is one such example, which the poet would have known well, even from the days of his youth. The ceiling inside the baptistery is covered with mosaic images that still dazzle visitors today. There are many indications that Dante too was dazzled by the sight. Quite a few correspondences can be discerned between certain descriptions in the <em>Comedy</em> and particular images within this baptistery&mdash;indeed, too many to be mere coincidence. &nbsp;For example, at the end of the <em>Inferno</em>, when Dante&#39;s fictional self&nbsp;reaches the deepest part of Hell and encounters &quot;the emperor of the dolorous kingdom&quot; (Satan),&nbsp;&nbsp;Dante&rsquo;s description is strikingly specific. &nbsp;Satan has three mouths, and &quot;In each of his mouths he was breaking a sinner/&nbsp;with his teeth in the manner of a scutch, so that he made the three suffer at once&quot;&nbsp;(translation by Durling and Martinez)&mdash;just like the image of Satan inside the Florence Baptistery. &nbsp;The link to this mosaic image is just one example of how the visual arts passed from Dante&rsquo;s memory through his imagination and onto the pages of his epic poem.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After a childhood and adolescence no doubt filled with sights of Florentine artistic wonders, Dante&rsquo;s familiarity with the visual arts matured. &nbsp;In <em>Purgatorio </em>XI his understanding of various forms of visual arts and artists is especially evident. &nbsp;Through a conversation between his fictional self and the manuscript illuminator Oderisi da Gubbio, Dante discusses the fading glory of artists, always eclipsed by another&rsquo;s&nbsp;greatness. &nbsp;He writes that just as Franco Bolognese surpassed his master Oderisi in illumination, and Giotto surpassed Cimabue in painting&mdash;in poetry, a certain unnamed poet (that is, Dante) just may have outdone Guido Cavalcanti and Guido Guinizelli.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Dante implies that there are similarities between the written word and the painted picture, as he directly associates these mediums and their practitioners with one another. Certainly, poets like Dante learned from and were influenced by artists, and as we will now see, visual artists were also greatly affected by poets such as this great Florentine.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Yates-Thompson Codex</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Among the dozens of illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, one of the most outstanding is known as the Yates-Thompson Codex, which is located in the British Library.&nbsp;It was originally carried out for Alfonso V, the king of Aragon, Naples and Sicily, either as a gift or under his commission. &nbsp;The manuscript was produced in Siena in the 1440s, and two illuminators&nbsp;worked&nbsp;on the 112 framed miniatures. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>When you think of Hell, what images fill your imagination? &nbsp;Your mind might first conjure up a monstrous satanic figure, and then you may further fill in the picture with other beastly devils that roam around torturing damned sinners, who in turn cry out with pain and regret.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>And how about the better parts of the Christian&nbsp;afterlife; how do you imagine them? Perhaps the saved are singing songs of joy, angels are fluttering about, and throngs of holy men and women converse and worship God. &nbsp;To some degree, such imaginings have their origins in the Bible. However, in the Christian West, conceptions of the afterlife evolved quite a bit over the centuries. One important late medieval figure who played a key role in shaping the cultural concepts of life after death&mdash;even to the present day&mdash;is Dante Alighieri, the Florentine poet who was born in the 1260s and died in 1321.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his epic poem known as the<em> Divine Comedy</em>, Dante creates a fictional version of himself who&nbsp;travels through the farthest reaches of&nbsp;hell <em>(Inferno)</em>, purgatory<em> (Purgatorio)</em>&nbsp;and paradise<em> (Paradiso)</em>. Many details that he describes along this journey have left a lasting impression on the Western imagination for more than half a millennium. &nbsp;In fact, the rather stereotypical images of the afterlife I described earlier are all represented in his work. But Dante also&nbsp;found novel ways to portray already well-formed concepts, thus further solidifying them while also reshaping them into new guises that would become&nbsp;familiar to countless generations that followed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Because of Dante&#39;s image-driven descriptions, many artists have sought to illustrate his text through a wide variety of media. &nbsp;Almost immediately after his work was completed, illuminators created images to accompany manuscripts of his masterpiece. More than forty illuminated manuscripts of the <em>Divine Comedy</em> were created before the advent of the printing press (in the late 15th century). &nbsp;When the potential&nbsp;for faster reproductions of books&mdash;including illustrated books&mdash;became a reality, Dante&#39;s imagination, sometimes intertwined with the imagination of an artist rendering a visual interpretation of his words, reached an even larger audience than before. &nbsp;We will look here at two outstanding examples of how Dante&#39;s words fed the creative imagination of visual artists before and shortly after the invention of the printing press. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>The influence of art on Dante&#39;s world</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before looking at Dante&#39;s influence on the visual arts, however, we need take a little step back in time. &nbsp;The relationship between Dante and the arts was a reciprocal one; images he had seen also greatly influenced his literary vision. Were there any sights, sounds or works of art you saw as a child that you can still easily call to mind today? If you were writing a fictional story that relied heavily on your own imagination, could you see yourself drawing from these vivid sensorial experiences and making them a part of that story? This was the case for Dante.</p>\n"

"<p><span>In ancient Rome equestrian statues of emperors would not have been uncommon sights in the city&mdash;late antique sources suggest that at least 22 of these &ldquo;great horses&rdquo; (<em>equi magni</em>) were to be seen&mdash;as they were official devices for honoring the emperor for singular military and civic achievements. The statues themselves were, in turn, copied in other media, including coins, for even wider distribution. Few examples of these equestrian statues survive from antiquity, however, making the <em>Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius</em> a singular artifact of Roman antiquity, one that has borne quiet witness to the ebb and flow of the city of Rome for nearly 1,900 years. A gilded bronze monument of the 170s C.E. that was originally dedicated to the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, referred to commonly as Marcus Aurelius (reigned 161-180 C.E.), the statue is an important object not only for the study of official Roman portraiture, but also for the consideration of monumental dedications. Further, the&nbsp;use of the statue&nbsp;in the Medieval, Renaissance, modern, and post-modern city of Rome has important implications for the connectivity that exists between the past and the present.</span></p>\n"

"<p>The statue is an over life-size depiction of the emperor elegantly mounted atop his horse while participating in a public ritual or ceremony; the statue stands approximately 4.24 meters tall.

The horse is saddled with a Persian-style saddlecloth of several layers, as opposed to a rigid saddle. It should be noted that the horse is an important and expressive element of the overall composition.</p>\n"

"<p>In the Roman world it was standard practice to create official portrait types of high-ranking officials, such as emperors that would then circulate in various media, notably sculpture in the round and coin portraits. These portrait types are vital in several respects, especially for determining the chronology of monuments and coins, since the portrait types can usually be placed in a fairly accurate and legible chronological order.

"\n"
"<p>Marcus Aurelius became emperor in 161 C.E., when he was forty years of age; this was the occasion for the creation of his third and most important portrait type.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This mature type shows the emperor fully bearded with a full head of tightly curled, voluminous hair; he retains the characteristic oval-shaped face and heavy eyelids from his earlier portraits. His coiffure forms a distinctive arc over his forehead. This third type is known from approximately&nbsp;50 copies.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The statue of the horseman is carefully composed by the artist and depicts a figure that is simultaneously dynamic and a bit passive and removed, by virtue of his facial expression (see image below). The locks of hair are curly and compact and distributed evenly; the beard is also curly, covering the cheeks and upper lip, and is worn longer at the chin. The pose of the body shows the rider&rsquo;s head turned slightly to his right, in the direction of his outstretched right arm. The left hand originally held the reins (no longer preserved) between the index and middle fingers, with the palm facing upwards. Scholars continue to debate whether he originally held some attached figure or object in the palm of the left hand; possible suggestions have included a scepter, a globe, a statue of victory &ndash; but there is no clear indication of any attachment point for such an object. On the left hand the rider does wear the senatorial ring.</p>\n"

"<p>The rider is clad in civic garb, including a short-sleeved tunic that is gathered at the waist by a knotted belt (<em>cingulum</em>). Over the tunic the rider wears a cloak (<em>paludamentum</em>) that is clasped at the right shoulder. On his feet Marcus Aurelius wears the senatorial boots of the patrician class, known as <em>calcei patricii</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation and chronology</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The interpretation and chronology of the equestrian statue must rely on the statue itself, as no ancient literary testimony or other evidence survives to aid in the interpretation. It is obvious that the statue is part of an elaborate public monument, no doubt commissioned to mark an important occasion in the emperor&rsquo;s reign. With that said, however, it must also be noted that scholars continue to debate its precise dating, the occasion for its creation, and its likely original location in the city of Rome.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Starting with the portrait typology it is possible to determine a range of likely dates for the statue&rsquo;s creation. The portrait is clearly an adult type of the emperor, meaning the statue must have been created after 161 C.E., the year of Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; accession and the creation of his third portrait type. This provides a <em>terminus post quem</em>&nbsp;(the limit after which) for the equestrian statue. Art historians have debated whether the portrait head most resembles the Type III or the Type IV portrait. Recent scholarly thinking, based on the work of Klaus Fittschen, holds that the equestrian portrait represents a unique variant of the standard Type III portrait, created as an improvisation by the artist who was commissioned to create the equestrian statue. In the end the precise chronology of the portrait head&mdash;and indeed the typology&mdash;remains a matter of scholarly debate.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"Relief from honorary monument to Marcus Aurelius, 176-180 C.E., marble\n"

The emperor stretches his right hand outward, the palm facing toward the ground; a pose that could be interpreted as the posture of <em>adlocutio</em>, indicating that the emperor is about to speak. However, more likely in this case we may read it as the gesture of clemency (<em>clementia</em>), offered to a vanquished enemy, or of <em>restitutio pacis</em>, the &quot;restoration of peace.&quot;&nbsp;Richard Brilliant has noted that since the emperor appears in civic garb as opposed to the general&rsquo;s armor, the overall impression of the statue is one of peace rather than of the immediate post-war celebration of military victory. Some art historians reconstruct a now-missing barbarian on the right side of the horse, as seen in a surviving panel relief sculpture that originally belonged to a now-lost triumphal arch dedicated to Marcus Aurelius (left). We know that Marcus Aurelius celebrated a triumph in 176 C.E. for his victories over German and Sarmatian tribes, leading some to suggest that year as the occasion for the creation of the equestrian monument.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>History</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The original location of the equestrian monument also remains debated, with some supporting a location on the Caelian Hill near the barracks of the imperial cavalry (equites singulares), while others favor the Campus Martius &nbsp;(a low-lying alluvial plain of the Tiber River)&nbsp;&nbsp;as a possible location. A text known as the <em>Liber Pontificalis</em> that dates to the middle of the tenth century C.E. mentions the equestrian monument, referring to it as &ldquo;<em>caballus Constantini</em>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;horse of Constantine.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to&nbsp;the text, the urban prefect of Rome was condemned following an uprising against Pope John XII and, as punishment, was hung by the hair from the equestrian monument. At this time the equestrian statue was located in the Lateran quarter of the city of Rome near the Lateran Palace, where it may have been since at least the eighth century C.E. Popular theories at the time held that the bearded emperor was in fact Constantine I, thus sparing the statue from being melted down.</p>\n"

"<span class=\"image-caption\">Reverse of Italian &euro; 0.50 coin</span></span>In 1538 the statue was relocated from the Lateran quarter to the Capitoline Hill to become the centerpiece for Michelangelo&rsquo;s new design for the Campidoglio (a piazza, or public square, at the top of the Capitoline hill). The statue was set atop a pedestal at the center of an intricately designed piazza flanked by three palazzi (image above). It became the centerpiece of the main piazza of secular Rome and, as such, an icon of the city, a role that its still retains. The equestrian statue still plays a role as an official symbol of the city of Rome, even being incorporated into the reverse image of the Italian version of the &euro; 0.50 coin (image above). The statue itself remained where Michelangelo positioned it until it was moved indoors in 1981 for conservation reasons; a high-tech copy of the original was placed on the pedestal. The ancient statue is now housed within the Musei Capitolini where it can be visited and viewed today.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius is an enduring monument, one that links the city&rsquo;s many phases, ancient and modern. It has borne witness to the city&rsquo;s imperial glory, post-imperial decline,&nbsp;its Renaissance resurgence, and even its quotidian experience in the twenty-first century. In so doing it reminds us about the role of public art in creating and reinforcing cultural identity as it relates to specific events and locations. In the ancient world the equestrian statue would have evoked powerful memories from the viewer, not only reinforcing the identity and appearance of the emperor but also calling to mind the key events, achievements, and celebrations of his administration. The statue is, like the city, eternal, as reflected by the Romanesco&nbsp;poet Giuseppe Belli who reflects in his sonnet <em>Campidojjo</em> (1830) that the gilded statue is directly linked to the long sweep of Rome&rsquo;s history.</p>\n"

"<p>The rider is clad in civic garb, including a short-sleeved tunic that is gathered at the waist by a knotted belt (<em>cingulum</em>).

On his feet Marcus Aurelius wears the senatorial boots of the patrician class, known as <em>calcei patricii</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation and chronology</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The interpretation and chronology of the equestrian statue must rely on the statue itself, as no ancient literary testimony or other evidence survives to aid in the interpretation. It is obvious that the statue is part of an elaborate public monument, no doubt commissioned to mark an important occasion in the emperor&rsquo;s reign. With that said, however, it must also be noted that scholars continue to debate its precise dating, the occasion for its creation, and its likely original location in the city of Rome.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Starting with the portrait typology it is possible to determine a range of likely dates for the statue&rsquo;s creation. The portrait is clearly an adult type of the emperor, meaning the statue must have been created after 161 C.E., the year of Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; accession and the creation of his third portrait type. This provides a <em>terminus post quem</em>&nbsp;(the limit after which) for the equestrian statue. Art historians have debated whether the portrait head most resembles the Type III or the Type IV portrait. Recent scholarly thinking, based on the work of Klaus Fittschen, holds that the equestrian portrait represents a unique variant of the standard Type III portrait, created as an improvisation by the artist who was commissioned to create the equestrian statue. In the end the precise chronology of the portrait head&mdash;and indeed the typology&mdash;remains a matter of scholarly debate.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"Relief from honorary monument to Marcus Aurelius, 176-180 C.E., marble\n"
"350 cm (Capitoline Museums, Rome)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/428a3ef45858cc5f9b6b09e71a8dd5ce7b7569c6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"> Relief from honorary monument to Marcus Aurelius, 176-180 C.E., marble 350 cm (Capitoline Museums, Rome)</span></span>The pose of the horseman is also helpful. The emperor stretches his right hand outward, the palm facing toward the ground; a pose that could be interpreted as the posture of <em>adlocutio</em>, indicating that the emperor is about to speak. However, more likely in this case we may read it as the gesture of clemency (<em>clementia</em>), offered to a vanquished enemy, or of <em>restitutio pacis</em>, the &quot;restoration of peace.&quot;&nbsp;Richard Brilliant has noted that since the emperor appears in civic garb as opposed to the general&rsquo;s armor, the overall impression of the statue is one of peace rather than of the immediate post-war celebration of military victory. Some art historians reconstruct a now-missing barbarian on the right side of the horse, as seen in a surviving panel relief sculpture that originally belonged to a now-lost triumphal arch dedicated to Marcus Aurelius (left). We know that Marcus Aurelius celebrated a triumph in 176 C.E. for his victories over German and Sarmatian tribes, leading some to suggest that year as the occasion for the creation of the equestrian monument.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>História</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The original location of the equestrian monument also remains debated, with some supporting a location on the Caelian Hill near the barracks of the imperial cavalry (equites singulares), while others favor the Campus Martius &nbsp;(a low-lying alluvial plain of the Tiber River)&nbsp;&nbsp;as a possible location. A text known as the <em>Liber Pontificalis</em> that dates to the middle of the tenth century C.E. mentions the equestrian monument, referring to it as &ldquo;<em>caballus Constantini</em>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;horse of Constantine.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to&nbsp;the text, the urban prefect of Rome was condemned following an uprising against Pope John XII and, as punishment, was hung by the hair from the equestrian monument. At this time the equestrian statue was located in the Lateran quarter of the city of Rome near the Lateran Palace, where it may have been since at least the eighth century C.E. Popular theories at the time held that the bearded emperor was in fact Constantine I, thus sparing the statue from being melted down.</p>\n"

"<span class=\"image-caption\">Reverse of Italian &euro; 0.50 coin</span></span>In 1538 the statue was relocated from the Lateran quarter to the Capitoline Hill to become the centerpiece for Michelangelo&rsquo;s new design for the Campidoglio (a piazza, or public square, at the top of the Capitoline hill). The statue was set atop a pedestal at the center of an intricately designed piazza flanked by three palazzi (image above). It became the centerpiece of the main piazza of secular Rome and, as such, an icon of the city, a role that its still retains. The equestrian statue still plays a role as an official symbol of the city of Rome, even being incorporated into the reverse image of the Italian version of the &euro; 0.50 coin (image above). The statue itself remained where Michelangelo positioned it until it was moved indoors in 1981 for conservation reasons; a high-tech copy of the original was placed on the pedestal. The ancient statue is now housed within the Musei Capitolini where it can be visited and viewed today.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius is an enduring monument, one that links the city&rsquo;s many phases, ancient and modern. It has borne witness to the city&rsquo;s imperial glory, post-imperial decline,&nbsp;its Renaissance resurgence, and even its quotidian experience in the twenty-first century. In so doing it reminds us about the role of public art in creating and reinforcing cultural identity as it relates to specific events and locations. In the ancient world the equestrian statue would have evoked powerful memories from the viewer, not only reinforcing the identity and appearance of the emperor but also calling to mind the key events, achievements, and celebrations of his administration. The statue is, like the city, eternal, as reflected by the Romanesco&nbsp;poet Giuseppe Belli who reflects in his sonnet <em>Campidojjo</em> (1830) that the gilded statue is directly linked to the long sweep of Rome&rsquo;s history.</p>\n"

Now in his sixties, Wright and his new wife Olgivanna were struggling to keep Taliesin, his Wisconsin home and studio, out of foreclosure. Worse still, his peers were beginning to regard Wright as an irrelevant anachronism whose time had passed.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1932 Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson opened the &quot;Modern Architecture:&nbsp;International Exhibition&quot; at the newly founded Museum of Modern Art in New York and simultaneously&nbsp;published the book&nbsp;<em>International Style</em>. This was, perhaps, the most influential architectural exhibit ever mounted in the United States and the book became a manifesto for modern architecture and would profoundly affect almost every major architectural project worldwide for the next 30 years. It focused on the work of four great &ldquo;European functionalists&rdquo;&quot;&nbsp;Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and J.J.P. Oud. Wright was largely snubbed.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Hitchcock had praise for his early work, for its &ldquo;many innovations,&quot;&nbsp;but he condemned Wright for a&nbsp;&ldquo;[l]ack of continuity in his development and his unwillingness to absorb the innovations of his contemporaries and his juniors in Europe.&rdquo; Hitchcock insulted Wright further by characterizing him as &ldquo;a rebel by temperament&hellip; [who] refused even the discipline of his own theories.&rdquo; The catalogue calls Wright a &ldquo;half-modern&rdquo; throwback, one of the &ldquo;last representatives of Romanticism.&rdquo;&nbsp;Wright responded by denigrating European Modernism as an &ldquo;evil crusade,&rdquo; a manifestation of &ldquo;totalitarianism.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A fellowship and a commission</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Wrights devised an architectural apprenticeship program that came to be known as the &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; And among the first candidates was Edgar Kaufmann Jr. who&nbsp;became enamored with Wright after reading his biography. Kaufmann was the son of Pittsburgh department store tycoon Edgar Kaufmann Sr.; whose thirteen story downtown Pittsburgh emporium was reported to be the largest in the world. Kaufmann senior was no stranger to architectural pursuits&mdash;he was&nbsp;involved in numerous public projects and&nbsp;built several stores and homes. Kaufmann&nbsp;let&nbsp;Wright know that he had several civic architectural projects in mind for him. He and his wife Liliane were invited to Taliesin and were duly impressed.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"<p>Wright is famous for pushing the architectural envelope for dramatic effect. We see this is in the vast cantilevered wooden roof of Robie House in Chicago. In Fallingwater he chose ferro-concrete for his cantilevers, this use of reinforced concrete for the long suspended balconies was revolutionary. He boldly extended the balcony of the second floor master bedroom soaring six feet beyond the living room below.&nbsp;</p>\n"

To avoid a complete collapse, an ingenious system was devised using tensioned cables to correct the problem and stabilize Wright&rsquo;s masterwork.</span><br />\n"

"<p>Wright is famous for pushing the architectural envelope for dramatic effect. We see this is in the vast cantilevered wooden roof of Robie House in Chicago. In Fallingwater he chose ferro-concrete for his cantilevers, this use of reinforced concrete for the long suspended balconies was revolutionary. He boldly extended the balcony of the second floor master bedroom soaring six feet beyond the living room below.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Over the years since, cracks have been repeatedly repaired as the cantilevers continued to sag. By 2001 some of the 15 foot cantilevers had fallen more than 7 inches. To avoid a complete collapse, an ingenious system was devised using tensioned cables to correct the problem and stabilize Wright&rsquo;s masterwork.</span><br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span>Almost from the day of its completion, Fallingwater was celebrated around the world. The house and its architect were featured in major publications including the cover of <em>Time Magazine</em>. Over the years its fame has only increased. According to Franklin Toker, Fallingwater&rsquo;s most important contribution to Modern Architecture is surely the &quot;acceptance of Modern architecture itself.&quot;</span></p>\n"

"<p><em>The Minotaur</em> belongs to his later, symbolic works and illustrates a scene from the famous ancient Greek myth.</p>\n"

"<p>After her defeat by the Cretans, the story goes, the city of Athens was forced every nine years to send as tribute seven youths and seven maidens. A ship, bearing a black sail, ferried the victims across the Aegean Sea to the land of their subjugators. Once on shore they were sent to the fabled Labyrinth of Daedalus, an impossibly complex maze-like structure, as large as a town.

"\n"

"\n"
"<p>In Borges, he is a prisoner, painfully unaware of the crime he has committed, who longs for nothing but to be killed. For Picasso, the Minotaur is a tragic figure, dying a pitiful death in his <em>Vollard Suite</em>. For the Victorians, though, the Minotaur was just plain evil, the embodiment of violence and depravity, an association that was dramatically exploited in one of the most effective journalistic campaigns of the nineteenth century.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>&ldquo;The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&rdquo;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In 1885 the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> published a series of articles by William Thomas Stead that proved a milestone in the history of modern journalism. At the time Parliament was delaying pushing through a bill that would raise the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen. In a bid to force through this piece of legislation, Stead&rsquo;s articles set about exposing the widespread practice of child prostitution, particularly in London. The analogy with the Minotaur myth, comparing these young girls with Athenian virgins, was a powerful trope, but far more compelling were Stead&rsquo;s investigative journalistic tactics, the most controversial involving the purchase for &pound;5 of a thirteen year-old girl, bought from her own parents.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The articles were instrumental in pushing the bill through, ensuring the age of consent was raised, as well as making it a criminal offence to procure girls for prostitution by the administering of drugs, intimidation or fraud. Not all the reforms were progressive, though. Equating child abuse with other forms of sexual behavior, the new laws also criminalized acts of homosexuality, now punishable with a two-year prison sentence, with or without hard labor. Over the months that followed, however, many cases of child abuse were successfully brought to trial, thanks in no small part to Stead&rsquo;s widely circulated articles.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Reading them prompted Watts to take up his brush, &quot;to hold up to detestation the bestial and brutal,&rdquo; as he put it, and paint <em>The Minotaur</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beast</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Viewed obliquely, his neck twisted, his face in <em>profil perdu</em> (the figure is viewed from behind, with the face only partially visible), the Minotaur stands on the ramparts of the Labyrinth, gazing, almost longingly, out to sea. On closer inspection one sees to the left the white sail of the ship bearing the seven fair youths and seven maidens from Athens. It is this that has caught his eye. Gripped by destructive impulses he crushes a small bird in his hand. The sail lies on the orthogonal created by his arm emphasizing the fact that they are heading towards a similar fate as the bird&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Painted with startling rapidity in a single morning, Watts rejects the academic finish of his Victorian counterparts, applying the paint with agitated brushstrokes. The form of the figure is built up with layers of red and yellow creating expressive muscular striations, bringing to mind Turner&rsquo;s incarnadine sunsets or perhaps the industrial processes&mdash;the steelworks and blast furnaces&mdash;that have forged this modern Babylon, London.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The angle of the body rhymes visually with the masonry that constrains it, creating a dynamic interplay of curve and line, of raw animal energy set against the geometric exactitude of Daedalus&rsquo;s structure. The frame, too, constrains the figure, emphasizing the verticality of the composition and suggesting at first glance that he is standing on two legs and not four. We soon realize, though, following the musculature of the neck, the curvature of the back and the modeling of the lower-half of the body that it is a bull-headed, centaur-like creature that we are looking at, the human torso emerging from the bulk of a bull&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>A more likely visual source, however, given Watts&rsquo;s training as a sculptor, are those famous scenes from the Centauromachy, the battle between the Centaurs and the Lapiths, illustrated on the metopes from the Parthenon, works which profoundly informed his early training as a sculptor.</p>\n"

To argue that his vulnerability is deceptive, designed to beguile us as it were seems an inadequate explanation and certainly out of keeping with the Minotaur myth.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Dream/painting</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One way of tackling the problem is to look at the immediate context of its production. As mentioned, the painting&nbsp;was executed swiftly, Watts&#39;s friend Mrs Russell Barrington recording how it was composed early one morning in response to &ldquo;a painful subject&rdquo; that &ldquo;had filled one of the evening papers.&rdquo; The earliness, the urgency and the likelihood that he had read Stead&rsquo;s article the previous evening are all interesting clues, leading one to the possible conclusion that it is not the text that Watts is illustrating, but the dream he had dreamt after reading it.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There is certainly a dreamlike quality to the painting, the symbols used all being highly charged with meaning: the sail, the labyrinth, the Minotaur, the crushed bird, the looping tail. If only Freud were around, we may be tempted to say. But then, of course, he was around and in the years following <em>The Minotaur</em>, was busy penning <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> (1900), in which he proposed that the unconscious mind is structured like a language, the mechanisms of which serve to hide from the dreamer their disturbing thoughts. With this in mind, while the symbolism of the dream/painting purports to illustrate Watts&rsquo;s support for Stead&rsquo;s campaign, the visual contradictions of the image seem out of step with the moral certitudes of the articles, allowing a reading of the painting as a sort of dream displacement in which, while borrowing the symbols of Stead, who himself had borrowed them from the ancient Greeks, Watts is actually saying something entirely different and entirely personal. Whatever meanings or interpretations the painting generates are for the individual viewer to construct. The art historian, Andrew Graham-Dixon, suggests this is a characteristic feature of Watts&rsquo;s later works which whether consciously or otherwise anticipate Modernism, giving form to &ldquo;the troubled subjectivity and anxious relativism of a new era.&rdquo;*</p>\n"

"<h3>Shocked, titillated, and frightened</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Working during the height of the Enlightenment, the so-called &ldquo;Age of Reason,&rdquo; the Swiss-English painter Henry Fuseli (born Johann Heinrich F&uuml;ssli) instead chose to depict darker, irrational forces in his famous painting&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare.</em>&nbsp;In Fuseli&rsquo;s startling composition, a woman bathed in white light stretches across a bed, her arms, neck, and head hanging off the end of the mattress. An apelike figure crouches on her chest while a horse with glowing eyes and flared nostrils emerges from the shadowy background.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The painting was first displayed at the annual Royal Academy exhibition in London in 1782, where it shocked, titillated, and frightened exhibition visitors and critics. Unlike many of the paintings that were then popular and successful at the Royal Academy exhibitions, Fuseli&rsquo;s <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Nightmare</em>&nbsp;has no moralizing subject. The scene is an invented one, a product of Fuseli&rsquo;s imagination. It certainly has a literary character and the various figures demonstrate Fuseli&rsquo;s broad knowledge of art history, but&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;subject is not drawn from history, the Bible, or literature. The painting&nbsp;has yielded many interpretations and is seen as prefiguring late nineteenth-century psychoanalytic theories regarding dreams and the unconscious&nbsp;(Sigmund Freud allegedly kept a reproduction of the painting on the wall of his apartment in Vienna).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Incubus or&nbsp;mara</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The figure that sits upon the woman&rsquo;s chest is often described as an imp or an incubus, a type of spirit said to lie atop people in their sleep or even to have sexual intercourse with sleeping women. Fuseli&rsquo;s painting is suggestive but not explicit, leaving open the possibility that the woman is simply dreaming. Yet, her dream appears to take frightening, physical form in the shapes of the incubus and the horse. According to Fuseli&rsquo;s friend and biographer John Knowles, who saw the first drawing Fuseli made for the composition in 1781, the horse was not present in the drawing but added to the painting later.</p>\n"

"<h3>The slums of New York</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Jacob&nbsp;Riis&nbsp;documented the slums of New York, what he deemed the world of&nbsp;the &ldquo;other half,&rdquo; teeming with immigrants, disease, and abuse. A police reporter and social&nbsp;reformer, Riis became intimately familiar with the perils of tenement living and sought to draw attention to the horrendous conditions. Between 1888 and 1892, he photographed the streets,&nbsp;people, and tenement apartments he encountered, using the vivid black and white slides to&nbsp;accompany his lectures and influential text, <em>How the Other Half Lives</em>, published in 1890 by&nbsp;Scribner&rsquo;s. His powerful images brought public attention to urban conditions, helping to propel a&nbsp;national debate over what American working and living conditions should be.</p>\n"

Riis initially struggled to get by, working&nbsp;as a carpenter and at various odd jobs before gaining a footing in journalism. In 1877 he became&nbsp;a police reporter for <em>The New York Tribune</em>, assigned to the beat of New York City&rsquo;s Lower East&nbsp;Side. Riis believed his personal struggle as an immigrant who &ldquo;reached New York with just one&nbsp;cent in my&nbsp;pocket&rdquo;*&nbsp;shaped his involvement in reform efforts to alleviate the suffering he witnessed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As a police reporter, Riis had unique access to the city&rsquo;s slums. In the evenings, he would accompany&nbsp;law enforcement and members of the health department on raids of the tenements,&nbsp;witnessing the atrocities people suffered firsthand. Riis tried to convey the horrors to readers,&nbsp;but struggled to articulate the enormity of the problems through his writings. Impressed by the&nbsp;newly invented flash photography technique he read about, Riis began to experiment with the&nbsp;medium in 1888, believing that pictures would have the power to expose the tenement-house&nbsp;problem in a way that his textual reporting could not do alone. Indeed, the images he captured&nbsp;would shock the&nbsp;conscience of Americans.</p>\n"

"<h3>Midnight rounds</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At first&nbsp;Riis engaged the services of a photographer who would accompany him as he made&nbsp;his midnight rounds with the police, but ultimately dissatisfied with this arrangement, Riis&nbsp;purchased a box camera and learned to use it. The flash technique used a combination of&nbsp;explosives to achieve the light necessary to take pictures in the dark. The process was new&nbsp;and messy and Riis made adjustments as he went. First, he or his assistants would position the&nbsp;camera on a tripod and then they would ignite the mixture of magnesium flash-powder above&nbsp;the camera lens, causing an explosive noise, great smoke, and a blinding flash of light. Initially,&nbsp;Riis used a revolver to shoot cartridges containing the explosive magnesium flash-powder, but&nbsp;he soon discovered that showing up waving pistols set the wrong tone and substituted a frying pan for&nbsp;the&nbsp;gun, flashing the light on that instead. The process certainly terrified those in the&nbsp;vicinity and also proved dangerous. Riis reported setting two fires in places he visited and nearly&nbsp;blinding himself on one occasion.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Home and work</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is unclear if Riis&rsquo; pictures were totally candid or posed, his agenda of using the stark&nbsp;images to persuade the middle and upper classes that reform was needed is well documented.&nbsp;A major theme of Riis&rsquo; images was the terrible conditions immigrants lived in. In the 1890s,&nbsp;tenement apartments served as both homes and as garment factories. &ldquo;Knee-Pants at Forty-Five&nbsp;Cents a Dozen&mdash;A Ludlow Street Sweater&rsquo;s Shop&rdquo; depicts the intersection of home and work life&nbsp;that was typical. Note&nbsp;the number of people crowded together making knickers and&nbsp;consider their ages, gender, and role. Each worker would be paid by the piece produced and each had his/her own particular role to fill in the shop which was also&nbsp;a family&#39;s&nbsp;home.</p>\n"

In this regard, Riis has been criticized for both his bias and reducing&nbsp;those photographed&nbsp;to nameless victims. &ldquo;Knee-Pants,&rdquo; appears in the chapter Jewtown and one can assume that&nbsp;the individuals are part of the large wave of Eastern European Jewish migration that flooded&nbsp;New York at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>\n"

Under the contracting system, the&nbsp;tenement shop would be responsible for assembling the garments, which made up the bulk&nbsp;of the work. By 1910, New York produced 70% of women&rsquo;s clothing and 40% of men&rsquo;s ready-made clothing. That meant that the knee-pants and garments made by the workers captured in&nbsp;this Ludlow Street sweatshop were shipped across the nation. Riis&rsquo; photographs&nbsp;helped make the sweatshop a subject of a national debate and the center of a struggle between&nbsp;workers, owners, consumers, politicians, and social reformers.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Progressive Era</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Riis&rsquo; photographs are part of a larger reform effort undertaken during the Progressive Era,&nbsp;that sought to address the problems of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Progressives&nbsp;worked under the premise that if one studies and documents a problem and proposes and tests&nbsp;solutions, difficulties can ultimately be solved, improving the welfare of society as a whole. Progressives&nbsp;like Riis, Lewis Hine, and Jessie Tarbox Beals pioneered the tradition of documentary&nbsp;photography, using the tool to record and publicize working and housing conditions and a&nbsp;renewed call for reform. These efforts ultimately led to government regulation and the passage&nbsp;of the 1901 Tenement House Law, which mandated new construction and sanitation regulations&nbsp;that improved the access to air, light, and water in all tenement buildings.<br />\n"

"<h3>The slums of New York</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Jacob&nbsp;Riis&nbsp;documented the slums of New York, what he deemed the world of&nbsp;the &ldquo;other half,&rdquo; teeming with immigrants, disease, and abuse. A police reporter and social&nbsp;reformer, Riis became intimately familiar with the perils of tenement living and sought to draw attention to the horrendous conditions. Between 1888 and 1892, he photographed the streets,&nbsp;people, and tenement apartments he encountered, using the vivid black and white slides to&nbsp;accompany his lectures and influential text, <em>How the Other Half Lives</em>, published in 1890 by&nbsp;Scribner&rsquo;s. His powerful images brought public attention to urban conditions, helping to propel a&nbsp;national debate over what American working and living conditions should be.</p>\n"

Riis initially struggled to get by, working&nbsp;as a carpenter and at various odd jobs before gaining a footing in journalism. In 1877 he became&nbsp;a police reporter for <em>The New York Tribune</em>, assigned to the beat of New York City&rsquo;s Lower East&nbsp;Side. Riis believed his personal struggle as an immigrant who &ldquo;reached New York with just one&nbsp;cent in my&nbsp;pocket&rdquo;*&nbsp;shaped his involvement in reform efforts to alleviate the suffering he witnessed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As a police reporter, Riis had unique access to the city&rsquo;s slums. In the evenings, he would accompany&nbsp;law enforcement and members of the health department on raids of the tenements,&nbsp;witnessing the atrocities people suffered firsthand. Riis tried to convey the horrors to readers,&nbsp;but struggled to articulate the enormity of the problems through his writings. Impressed by the&nbsp;newly invented flash photography technique he read about, Riis began to experiment with the&nbsp;medium in 1888, believing that pictures would have the power to expose the tenement-house&nbsp;problem in a way that his textual reporting could not do alone. Indeed, the images he captured&nbsp;would shock the&nbsp;conscience of Americans.</p>\n"

"<h3>Midnight rounds</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At first&nbsp;Riis engaged the services of a photographer who would accompany him as he made&nbsp;his midnight rounds with the police, but ultimately dissatisfied with this arrangement, Riis&nbsp;purchased a box camera and learned to use it. The flash technique used a combination of&nbsp;explosives to achieve the light necessary to take pictures in the dark. The process was new&nbsp;and messy and Riis made adjustments as he went. First, he or his assistants would position the&nbsp;camera on a tripod and then they would ignite the mixture of magnesium flash-powder above&nbsp;the camera lens, causing an explosive noise, great smoke, and a blinding flash of light. Initially,&nbsp;Riis used a revolver to shoot cartridges containing the explosive magnesium flash-powder, but&nbsp;he soon discovered that showing up waving pistols set the wrong tone and substituted a frying pan for&nbsp;the&nbsp;gun, flashing the light on that instead. The process certainly terrified those in the&nbsp;vicinity and also proved dangerous. Riis reported setting two fires in places he visited and nearly&nbsp;blinding himself on one occasion.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Home and work</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While it is unclear if Riis&rsquo; pictures were totally candid or posed, his agenda of using the stark&nbsp;images to persuade the middle and upper classes that reform was needed is well documented.&nbsp;A major theme of Riis&rsquo; images was the terrible conditions immigrants lived in. In the 1890s,&nbsp;tenement apartments served as both homes and as garment factories. &ldquo;Knee-Pants at Forty-Five&nbsp;Cents a Dozen&mdash;A Ludlow Street Sweater&rsquo;s Shop&rdquo; depicts the intersection of home and work life&nbsp;that was typical. Note&nbsp;the number of people crowded together making knickers and&nbsp;consider their ages, gender, and role. Each worker would be paid by the piece produced and each had his/her own particular role to fill in the shop which was also&nbsp;a family&#39;s&nbsp;home.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>While Riis did not record the names of the people he photographed, he organized his book into&nbsp;ethnic sections, categorizing the images according to the racial and ethnic stereotypes of his&nbsp;age. In this regard, Riis has been criticized for both his bias and reducing&nbsp;those photographed&nbsp;to nameless victims. &ldquo;Knee-Pants,&rdquo; appears in the chapter Jewtown and one can assume that&nbsp;the individuals are part of the large wave of Eastern European Jewish migration that flooded&nbsp;New York at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>\n"

"<p>They are likely conversing in Yiddish and share&nbsp;some type of familial or neighborly connection. Some of the workers depicted might have lived in a neighboring New&nbsp;York City apartment or next door back in the old country. Home life, family relations and business relations, are intertwined. Just as it is impossible to know the names of the people captured in Riis&rsquo; image, and what Riis actually thought of them, one also cannot know their own&nbsp;impressions of the workplace, or their hopes and day-to-day challenges.</p>\n"

Under the contracting system, the&nbsp;tenement shop would be responsible for assembling the garments, which made up the bulk&nbsp;of the work. By 1910, New York produced 70% of women&rsquo;s clothing and 40% of men&rsquo;s ready-made clothing. That meant that the knee-pants and garments made by the workers captured in&nbsp;this Ludlow Street sweatshop were shipped across the nation. Riis&rsquo; photographs&nbsp;helped make the sweatshop a subject of a national debate and the center of a struggle between&nbsp;workers, owners, consumers, politicians, and social reformers.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Progressive Era</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Riis&rsquo; photographs are part of a larger reform effort undertaken during the Progressive Era,&nbsp;that sought to address the problems of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Progressives&nbsp;worked under the premise that if one studies and documents a problem and proposes and tests&nbsp;solutions, difficulties can ultimately be solved, improving the welfare of society as a whole. Progressives&nbsp;like Riis, Lewis Hine, and Jessie Tarbox Beals pioneered the tradition of documentary&nbsp;photography, using the tool to record and publicize working and housing conditions and a&nbsp;renewed call for reform. These efforts ultimately led to government regulation and the passage&nbsp;of the 1901 Tenement House Law, which mandated new construction and sanitation regulations&nbsp;that improved the access to air, light, and water in all tenement buildings.<br />\n"

"<h3><em>Bi</em></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Stone rings were being made by the peoples of eastern China as early as the fifth millennium B.C.E. Jade discs have been found carefully laid on the bodies of the dead in tombs of the Hongshan culture (about 3800-2700 B.C.E.), a practice which was continued by later Neolithic cultures. Large and heavy jade discs such as this example, appear to have been an innovation of the Liangzhu culture (about 3000-2000 B.C.E.), although they are not found in all major Liangzhu tombs. The term bi is applied to wide discs with proportionately small central holes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most finely carved discs or bi of the best stone (like the example above) were placed in prominent positions, often near the stomach and the chest of the deceased. Other bi were aligned with the body. Where large numbers of discs are found, usually in small piles, they tend to be rather coarse, made of stone of inferior quality that has been worked in a cursory way.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We do not know what the true significance of these discs was, but they must have had an important ritual function as part of the burial. This is an exceptionally fine example, with the two faces very highly polished.</p>\n"

Large and heavy jade discs such as this example, appear to have been an innovation of the Liangzhu culture (about 3000-2000 B.C.E.), although they are not found in all major Liangzhu tombs. The term bi is applied to wide discs with proportionately small central holes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most finely carved discs or bi of the best stone (like the example above) were placed in prominent positions, often near the stomach and the chest of the deceased. Other bi were aligned with the body. Where large numbers of discs are found, usually in small piles, they tend to be rather coarse, made of stone of inferior quality that has been worked in a cursory way.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We do not know what the true significance of these discs was, but they must have had an important ritual function as part of the burial. This is an exceptionally fine example, with the two faces very highly polished.</p>\n"

"<p><span>On the bank of a cool spring in a lush meadow, a beautiful princess swoons at the sight of a young prince who has stumbled upon her bathing. To an eighteenth century audience, the pair would have been immediately recognizable as Shirin and Khusraw, two of the most famous lovers in the history of Persian literature. Although rendered in oils with a palette indebted to the European&nbsp;Renaissance, the canvas immediately betrays its Islamic origin in its carefully rounded top&mdash;it was&nbsp;designed to fit into the window-shaped niches common in Persian architecture of the period.

"\n"
"<h3>For the love of images</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The content of the painting derives from Nizami&rsquo;s <em>Khamsa</em>, an immensely popular quintet of poems compiled in the thirteenth century. Of the stories recounted, the tale of the love shared between Shirin, a Lebanese princess, and Khusraw, a Sasanian prince, was most celebrated for its romantic appeal and poetic rendering. Nizami&rsquo;s telling of the story emphasizes the power of words and images to inflame the passions of the two lovers. The story is set in motion when Khusraw, aroused by the vivid description of Shirin&rsquo;s beauty by his court painter, Shapur, sends the artist off to lure the princess into his kingdom.</p>\n"

However, on the third day, Shirin falls in love with the man in the painting and learns of his identity from Shapur.

"<p>What follows is Nizami&rsquo;s account of the fated meeting of the lovers depicted in the present painting:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>For fourteen days and fourteen nights she [Shirin] traveled. Then she came upon an emerald field in which there gleamed a gentle pool&hellip; When she had satisfied herself that she was quite alone, she tethered Shabdiz and prepared to bathe. Beautiful was the whiteness of her skin against the blueness of the water. She loosed her braids and washed her long black hair, and the moon-like reflection of her face was caught in the shallows of the pool (Chelkowski, 25).</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, Khusraw&rsquo;s rapid departure from his palace brings him into the vicinity of the princess.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>[H]e ordered his attendants to feed their horses while he rode on alone. Suddenly, he came upon the pool in the emerald field and saw Shirin sitting in the water like a lily. At the sight of her his heart caught fire and burned; he trembled with desire in every limb.

Startled, she gathered her black hair about her like a cloak, emerged from the pool, dressed, and mounted her horse. At the touch of her heel, Shabdiz carried her off into the shadows of the late afternoon (Chelkowski, 26).</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Imperial Patronage</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Worship and power struggles, enlightenment and suicide&mdash;the 2300 caves and niches filled with Buddhist art at&nbsp;Longmen in China has witnessed it all. The&nbsp;steep limestone cliffs extend for almost a mile and contain approximately 110,000 Buddhist stone statues, 60 stupas (hemispherical structures containing Buddhist relics) and 2,800 inscriptions carved on steles (vertical stone markers).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Buddhism, born in India, was transmitted to China intermittently and haphazardly. Starting as early as the 1st century C.E., Buddhism brought to China new images, texts, ideas about&nbsp;life and death, and new opportunities to assert authority. The Longmen cave-temple complex, located on both sides of the Yi River (south of the ancient capital of Luoyang), is an excellent site for understanding how rulers wielded this foreign religion to affirm assimilation and superiority.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Many of the Tuoba elite opposed the move and disapproved of Xiao Wen&rsquo;s eager adoption of Chinese culture. Even his own son disapproved and was forced to end his own life. At first, Emperor Xiao Wen and rich citizens focused&nbsp;on building the city&rsquo;s administrative and court quarters&mdash;only later did they shift their energies and wealth into the construction of monasteries and temples.

"<p>In the images of&nbsp;arhats (worthy monks who have advanced very far in their quest of Enlightenment),&nbsp;who line the walls,&nbsp;the carver sought to create intense realism.

Twenty-nine monks form a procession around the cave perimeter, linking the subject matter to the rising interest in Chan Buddhism (the Meditation School) fostered at court by the empress herself. These&nbsp;portraits record&nbsp;the lineage of the great patriarchs who transmitted the Buddhist doctrine.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Sovereignty and iconography</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Foreign rulers of the Northern Wei, yearning for assimilation and control, made use of Buddhist images for authority and power. Tang dynasty leaders thrived during China&rsquo;s golden age, asserting their sovereignty with the assistance of Buddhist iconography. Today you can visit the stunning limestone remains in Luoyang, New York City, and Kansas City.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3><span>Imperial Patronage</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Worship and power struggles, enlightenment and suicide&mdash;the 2300 caves and niches filled with Buddhist art at&nbsp;Longmen in China has witnessed it all. The&nbsp;steep limestone cliffs extend for almost a mile and contain approximately 110,000 Buddhist stone statues, 60 stupas (hemispherical structures containing Buddhist relics) and 2,800 inscriptions carved on steles (vertical stone markers).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Buddhism, born in India, was transmitted to China intermittently and haphazardly. Starting as early as the 1st century C.E., Buddhism brought to China new images, texts, ideas about&nbsp;life and death, and new opportunities to assert authority. The Longmen cave-temple complex, located on both sides of the Yi River (south of the ancient capital of Luoyang), is an excellent site for understanding how rulers wielded this foreign religion to affirm assimilation and superiority.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Wei dynasty was founded by Tuoba tribesmen (nomads from the frontiers of northern China) who&nbsp;were considered to be barbaric foreigners by the Han Chinese. Northern Wei Emperor Xiao Wen decided to move the capital south to Luoyang in 494 C.E., a region considered the cradle of Chinese civilization. Many of the Tuoba elite opposed the move and disapproved of Xiao Wen&rsquo;s eager adoption of Chinese culture. Even his own son disapproved and was forced to end his own life. At first, Emperor Xiao Wen and rich citizens focused&nbsp;on building the city&rsquo;s administrative and court quarters&mdash;only later did they shift their energies and wealth into the construction of monasteries and temples. With all the efforts expended on the city, the court barely managed to complete one cave temple at Longmen&mdash;the Central Binyang Cave.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>In the images of&nbsp;arhats (worthy monks who have advanced very far in their quest of Enlightenment),&nbsp;who line the walls,&nbsp;the carver sought to create intense realism. Although they are still mortal, arhats&nbsp;are capable of extraordinary deeds both physical and spiritual (they can move at free will through space, can understand the thoughts in people&#39;s minds, and hear the voices of far away speakers). Twenty-nine monks form a procession around the cave perimeter, linking the subject matter to the rising interest in Chan Buddhism (the Meditation School) fostered at court by the empress herself. These&nbsp;portraits record&nbsp;the lineage of the great patriarchs who transmitted the Buddhist doctrine.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Sovereignty and iconography</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Foreign rulers of the Northern Wei, yearning for assimilation and control, made use of Buddhist images for authority and power. Tang dynasty leaders thrived during China&rsquo;s golden age, asserting their sovereignty with the assistance of Buddhist iconography. Today you can visit the stunning limestone remains in Luoyang, New York City, and Kansas City.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>As the viewer, we are placed at a slight leftward angle from the woman in the chair so that we see her through her reflection in the mirror while she is looking away from it.

"<p>Her desire to emulate the haziness, sensual, and&nbsp;suggestive possibilities of pastels is what motivated Cassatt not to use woodblock printing but intaglio. First, Cassatt carved her designs onto a smooth copper plate with a fine metal needle.&nbsp;Then the plate would be dusted with a powdered resin and heated until the resin melted in tiny mounds that hardened as they cooled. Acid was then added on to the metal plate biting the channels along the resin droplets. The deeper penetration of acid produced richer, darker tones, while a lighter application of acid produced lighter shades of color and a variety of nuanced gradients could be generated within a single print. Once Cassatt had replicated a certain number of images from a plate, she would incise the plate with a needle so that no one could use the same image again.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Cassatt was inspired in part by some of Degas&rsquo; pastels of women grooming. In Cassatt&rsquo;s prints, the time-honored boudoir scenes we see in Titian and Bellini become de-eroticized and re-appropriated as skilled exercises in form, shading, and line. In the spirit of <em>ukiyo-e</em> and Impressionism, these prints capture fugitive, fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Cassatt&rsquo;s motivation in making the prints was to make her art more accessible for a large audience. She believed that everyone, regardless of income or social position, should be able to experience art and to own works they enjoy:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>I believe [nothing] will inspire a taste for art more than the possibility of having it in the home. I should like to feel that amateurs in America could have an example of my work, a print or an etching, for a few dollars. That is what they do in France. It is not left to the rich alone to buy art; the people&mdash;even the poor&mdash;have taste and buy according to their means, and here they can always find something they can afford. [2]</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This philosophy of art for the masses wasn&rsquo;t always popular with Mary Cassatt&rsquo;s contemporaries, like John Singer Sargent and the art historian Vernon Lee (Violet Paget), who viewed Cassatt&rsquo;s printmaking as a dilution of her precious talent. Yet Cassatt understood that as the world was changing with the twentieth century&rsquo;s new industries and technology, more and more people would have the income, education, and ability to experience art in ways they hadn&rsquo;t been able to before.&nbsp;The proliferative possibilities of the print and its evocative potential to convey so much in such a small space was just the art form to reach a wider&nbsp;audience.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The deeper penetration of acid produced richer, darker tones, while a lighter application of acid produced lighter shades of color and a variety of nuanced gradients could be generated within a single print. Once Cassatt had replicated a certain number of images from a plate, she would incise the plate with a needle so that no one could use the same image again.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>Cassatt was inspired in part by some of Degas&rsquo; pastels of women grooming. In Cassatt&rsquo;s prints, the time-honored boudoir scenes we see in Titian and Bellini become de-eroticized and re-appropriated as skilled exercises in form, shading, and line. In the spirit of <em>ukiyo-e</em> and Impressionism, these prints capture fugitive, fleeting moments of the busy lives of the Parisian bourgeois and working class.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Cassatt&rsquo;s motivation in making the prints was to make her art more accessible for a large audience. She believed that everyone, regardless of income or social position, should be able to experience art and to own works they enjoy:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"<p>I believe [nothing] will inspire a taste for art more than the possibility of having it in the home. I should like to feel that amateurs in America could have an example of my work, a print or an etching, for a few dollars. That is what they do in France. It is not left to the rich alone to buy art; the people&mdash;even the poor&mdash;have taste and buy according to their means, and here they can always find something they can afford. [2]</p>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This philosophy of art for the masses wasn&rsquo;t always popular with Mary Cassatt&rsquo;s contemporaries, like John Singer Sargent and the art historian Vernon Lee (Violet Paget), who viewed Cassatt&rsquo;s printmaking as a dilution of her precious talent. Yet Cassatt understood that as the world was changing with the twentieth century&rsquo;s new industries and technology, more and more people would have the income, education, and ability to experience art in ways they hadn&rsquo;t been able to before.&nbsp;The proliferative possibilities of the print and its evocative potential to convey so much in such a small space was just the art form to reach a wider&nbsp;audience.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The story behind the creation of <em>Object</em>, an ordinary cup, spoon, and saucer wrapped evocatively in gazelle fur, has been told so many times its importance in modernist history transcends the fact it might be apocryphal (of dubious authenticity). The twenty-two year old Basel-born artist, Meret Oppenheim, had been in Paris for four years when, one day, she was at a caf&eacute; with Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar. Oppenheim was wearing a brass bracelet covered in fur when Picasso and Maar, who were admiring it, proclaimed, &ldquo;Almost anything can be covered in fur!&rdquo; As Oppenheim&rsquo;s tea grew cold, she jokingly asked the waiter for &ldquo;more fur.&rdquo; Inspiration struck&mdash;Oppenheim is said to have gone straight from the caf&eacute; to a store where she purchased the cup, saucer, and spoon used in this piece. This amusing story belies the importance of Object and the critical acclaim and public fascination that has elevated it to point where it has become the definitive surrealist object...ultimately to Oppenheim&rsquo;s dismay.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What Is a Surrealist Object?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Oppenheim&rsquo;s <em>Object</em> was created at a moment when sculpted objects and assemblages had become prominent features of Surrealist art practice. In 1937, British art critic Herbert Read emphasized that all Surrealist objects were representative of an idea and Salvador Dal&iacute; described some of them as &ldquo;objects with symbolic function.&rdquo; In other words, how might an otherwise typical, functional object be modified so it represents something deeply personal and poetic? How might it, in Freudian terms, resonate as a sublimation of internal desire and aspiration? Such physical manifestations of our internal psyches were indicative of a <em>surreality</em>, or the point in which external and internal realities united, as described by Andr&eacute; Breton (one of Surrealism&rsquo;s founders and theorists) in his first <em>Manifesto of Surrealism</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Visceral Responses</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What, then, do we make of this set of be-furred tableware? Interpretations vary wildly. The art historian Whitney Chadwick has described it as linked to the Surrealist&rsquo;s love of alchemical transformation by turning cool, smooth ceramic and metal into something warm and bristley, while many scholars have noted the fetishistic qualities of the fur-lined set&mdash;as the fur imbues these functional, hand-held objects with sexual connotations. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In a 1936 issue of the <em>New Yorker Magazine</em>, it was reported that a woman fainted &ldquo;right in front of the fur-bearing cup and saucer [while it was on exhibit at MoMA]. &ldquo;She left no name with the attendants who revived her - only a vague feeling of apprehension.&rdquo;* Such visceral reactions to Oppenheim&rsquo;s sculpture come closest, perhaps, to what were likely the artist&rsquo;s aspirations. In an interview later in life, Oppenheim described her creations as &ldquo;not an illustration of an idea, but the thing itself.&rdquo;<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Unlike Read and Dal&iacute;, Oppenheim stresses the physicality of <em>Object</em>, reinforcing the way we can readily imagine the feeling of the fur while drinking from the cup, and using the saucer and spoon. The frisson we experience when china is unexpectedly wrapped in fur is based on our familiarity with both, and the fur requires us to extend our sensory experiences to fully appreciate the work. <em>Object</em> insists we imagine what sipping warm tea from this cup feels like, how the bristles would feel upon our lips. &nbsp;With Oppenheim&rsquo;s elegant creation, how we understand those visceral memories, how we create metaphors and symbols out of this act of tactile extension, is entirely open to interpretation by each individual, which is, in many ways, the whole point of Surrealism itself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Presentation Problems</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In spite of our individual response, the interpretation of <em>Object</em> has been complicated by the ways it was assigned meaning by others. When <em>Object</em> was finished, Oppenheim submitted it to Breton for an exhibition of Surrealist objects at the Charles Ratton Gallery in Paris in 1936. &nbsp;However, while Oppenheim preferred a non-descriptive title, Breton took the liberty of titling the piece <em>Le D&eacute;jeneur en fourrure</em>, or <em>Luncheon in Fur</em>. &nbsp;This title is a play on two nineteenth-century works: &Eacute;douard Manet&rsquo;s infamous modernist painting <em>Luncheon on the Grass (Le D&eacute;jeneur sur l&rsquo;herbe)</em> and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch&rsquo;s erotic novel <em>Venus in Furs</em>. With these two references, Breton forces an explicit sexualized meaning onto <em>Object</em>. Recall that the original inspiration for this work was implicitly practical: when Oppenheim asked the waiter for more fur for her cooling teacup, it was suggested as a way to keep her tea warm, and not necessarily as overtly sexual.<br />\n"

The title and&nbsp;laced shoes together suggest the potential act of undressing and a fascination with exposing the female body. However, when Oppenheim later described <em>Das Paar</em> (with the laces untied), she stated it was an &ldquo;odd unisexual pair: two shoes, unobserved at night, doing &lsquo;forbidden&rsquo; things.&rdquo; She expressly assigned no gender, and suggests the &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; acts already taking place between anthropomorphized shoes. She takes a more literal approach, the shoes as expressive things in themselves, rather than symbolically resonant of something else.</span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Dangerous Success</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Yet, the early acclaim for the fur-covered <em>Object</em> had a negative effect on Oppenheim&rsquo;s early career. &nbsp;When it was purchased by The Museum of Modern Art and featured in their influential 1936-37 exhibition &quot;Fantastic Art, Dada, and Surrealism&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;visitors &nbsp;declared it the &ldquo;quintessential&rdquo; Surrealist object.

It was only later when she re-emerged, and began publicly showing new paintings and objects with renewed vigor and confidence, that she began reclaiming some of the intent of her work. When she was given an award for her work by the City of Basel, she touched upon this in her acceptance speech: &ldquo;I think it is the duty of a woman to lead a life that expresses her disbelief in the validity of the taboos that have been imposed upon her kind for thousands of years.

"<p>The emancipation of European&nbsp;Jews from ghettos became a benchmark of sorts indicating&nbsp;a nation&rsquo;s transformation from the medieval to the modern.&nbsp;Upon the formation of a secular nation, French Jews received civil rights in 1791 and 1792. Other European nations followed throughout the 19th century. National communities distanced themselves from old forms of Christianity, and they tolerated Jews, albeit with reservations.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish enlightenment (<em>Haskalah</em>)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Germany, which did not become a&nbsp;unified nation until 1871, Jews were not granted full equality. Rights depended on local municipalities and in some places, Jews were awarded rights only to have them taken away soon after. It is no coincidence that Germany was the birthplace of Reform Judaism.&nbsp;Progressive thinkers sought to transform Judaism from within when they could not stem prejudice against Jews from without.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Moses Mendelssohn &nbsp;pioneered the Jewish Enlightenment, or <em>Haskalah</em>, which advocated many of the same ideas about freedom and equal rights as those that&nbsp;Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant explored.&nbsp;Mendelssohn openly discussed the ways that Jews could live in a multi-religious society. &ldquo;Adopt the mores and constitution of the country in which you find yourself,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but be steadfast in upholding the religion of your fathers, too.&rdquo;*&nbsp;In subsequent generations, many Jews&mdash;among them, Karl Marx&rsquo;s parents&mdash;found it easier simply to convert to Christianity and live publicly as Christians in order to access jobs, property, and other basic rights.</p>\n"

Reformers spurned the idea that the past could dictate a way of life in an increasingly secular and&nbsp;industrial&nbsp;context.&nbsp;They modeled many of their religious practices after German Christians&nbsp;encouraging&nbsp;&ldquo;decorum&rdquo; in synagogue, introducing&nbsp;music similar to that heard in churches, and many even wanted to switch the Sabbath to Sunday. They wanted to remain Jews, while highlighting Judaism&rsquo;s similarities with Christianity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Orthodox movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These efforts infuriated traditionalists, who then reacted with steadfast conservatism.&nbsp; Some traditional rabbis had long opposed emancipation, but in response to the Reformers, a group of adherents to <em>Halakhah </em>codified the new Orthodox movement.&nbsp;They opposed many of the secular cultural forms that Judaism took in the coming decades: the Yiddishist movement, Zionism, and any other divergences from strict Halakhah. Some insisted that established customs not grounded in Jewish law should take on the weight of <em>Halakhah</em>&mdash;this is why some groups continue to dress and speak like their ancestors from a century ago or more.&nbsp; These extreme forms of observance are as much a product of modernity as Reform.</p>\n"

"<h3>Hasidic Judaism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Eastern Europe, another religious movement, called Hasidism, gained traction parallel to Reform and Orthodoxy.&nbsp;Founded in the eighteenth century by a rabbi and mystic who called himself Israel Baal Shem Tov, Hasidic Judaism grew out of a populist reaction to the elitism of the traditional Talmudic academy. Hasidic Judaism focuses on mystical interpretations of holy texts and the potential for uneducated Jews to experience holiness. The movement spread rapidly across Eastern and Central Europe. Hasidism&nbsp;gave rise to opposition from at least two sides: the traditional rabbinic legal structures that revolved around organized Torah study, and the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; Jews intent on both escaping the oppressive framework of the traditional Jewish family and acculturating into European society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In spite of Hasidic Judaism&rsquo;s strained history with what came to be known as Orthodoxy, it has become harder to distinguish stringent Orthodox Jews from their Hasidic counterparts. As Reform Judaism gained popularity, the two groups joined forces in support of Halakhah and in opposition to radical reform. Known for their distinctive dress (beards, fur hats, sidelocks, and caftans for men), Hasidim are among the most visible Jewish groups.</p>\n"

From Russia to Damascus, and Danzig to Algiers, Jews were attacked as infiltrators and blamed for a wide range of&nbsp;social and economic problems.&nbsp;Accusations and rumors led to riots and <em>pogroms</em> (a&nbsp;Russian word that means&nbsp;to violently destroy,&nbsp;used to describe the riots&nbsp;in Eastern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries&nbsp;that resulted&nbsp;in the rape and&nbsp;murder of Jews and the theft and&nbsp;destruction of their property).</p>\n"

"<h3>Zionism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Several events from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries proved that Jews were not welcomed as equals. In Russia, violent pogroms and economic instability pushed over two million people to emigrate&nbsp;in the 1880s. The vast majority fled to North America, and a small fraction of pioneers traveled to Palestine, the site of ancient Judaism&rsquo;s origins. Some Jewish leaders, responding to the growing nationalism and antisemitism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, followed Theodor Herzl&nbsp;who advocated for a type of&nbsp;secular Jewish nationalism, a return to the biblical homeland of the Jewish people.&nbsp;Religious Jews had prayed facing Jerusalem and called for a Messianic return to the Land of Israel since the Second Temple was destroyed. But the modern political movement, known as Zionism, united the religious impulse to &ldquo;return&rdquo; with&nbsp;secular ideas about constructing a European-style nation for Jews.&nbsp;It is important to note that Zionism was but one form of Jewish nationalism that took hold in the nineteenth century. Some Jews fought for territorial and political autonomy on different parts of the globe, others fought for cultural autonomy in the nations where they lived. These Diaspora nationalist movements mostly disappeared in 1948 when Israel became an&nbsp;independent state.</p>\n"

"<h3>Holocaust</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;The antisemite creates the Jew,&rdquo; wrote the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; Antisemitism had generated a false image of what a Jew is, making Jews seem like a social danger for the majority of Europeans. After World War I, liberal democracies everywhere appeared to be failing.&nbsp;The idea that Jews were responsible for social and economic crises convinced many&nbsp;to use race and ethnicity as a test to determine who&nbsp;belonged and who&nbsp;ought to be excluded.&nbsp;It was in this climate that the Nazi party was elected to power in 1933.&nbsp;Combining their expansionist vision with&nbsp;spurious theories of racial purity, the Germans quickly came to control most of central and eastern Europe.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Genocide became an everyday phenomenon&mdash;the Nuremburg Laws forced Jews to identify themselves with a badge, and criminalized sexual intimacy between Jews and gentiles. Laws were passed across Europe and the Mediterranean that excluded Jews from certain professions and the right to attend school.&nbsp;Citizenship was revoked and many people were&nbsp;forced&nbsp;from their homes into overcrowded wards.&nbsp;Inspired by the medieval ghetto, the Nazis went further&mdash;killing Jews by restricting food and medicine, packing thousands into spaces fit for far fewer, and, eventually, forbidding Jews to leave at all. Working in collaboration with governments across Europe, Nazi officials enacted a &ldquo;Final Solution&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Jewish Question&rdquo; in early 1942.&nbsp;Jews were forcibly&nbsp;gathered and shipped to local concentration camps and to death camps in Poland and Russia.&nbsp;Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>The emancipation of European&nbsp;Jews from ghettos became a benchmark of sorts indicating&nbsp;a nation&rsquo;s transformation from the medieval to the modern.&nbsp;Upon the formation of a secular nation, French Jews received civil rights in 1791 and 1792. Other European nations followed throughout the 19th century. National communities distanced themselves from old forms of Christianity, and they tolerated Jews, albeit with reservations.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Jewish enlightenment (<em>Haskalah</em>)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Germany, which did not become a&nbsp;unified nation until 1871, Jews were not granted full equality. Rights depended on local municipalities and in some places, Jews were awarded rights only to have them taken away soon after. It is no coincidence that Germany was the birthplace of Reform Judaism.&nbsp;Progressive thinkers sought to transform Judaism from within when they could not stem prejudice against Jews from without.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Moses Mendelssohn &nbsp;pioneered the Jewish Enlightenment, or <em>Haskalah</em>, which advocated many of the same ideas about freedom and equal rights as those that&nbsp;Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant explored.&nbsp;Mendelssohn openly discussed the ways that Jews could live in a multi-religious society. &ldquo;Adopt the mores and constitution of the country in which you find yourself,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but be steadfast in upholding the religion of your fathers, too.&rdquo;*&nbsp;In subsequent generations, many Jews&mdash;among them, Karl Marx&rsquo;s parents&mdash;found it easier simply to convert to Christianity and live publicly as Christians in order to access jobs, property, and other basic rights.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Reform movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Isador Kaufmann, Man with Fur Hat, c. 1910, Vienna (The Jewish Museum, New York). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/47cb3f02e63fb844d162d5eb84bf5f935caddc99.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Isador Kaufmann, <em>Man with Fur Hat</em>, c. 1910, Vienna (The Jewish Museum, New York).&nbsp;&ldquo;Kaufmann&rsquo;s portraits of religiously devout Jews conveyed aspects of Jewish tradition that his audience of acculturated Jews and non-Jews would understand. Here, the sitters orthodoxy is indicated by his fur-trimmed shtraymel (hat) and black kapote (coat). Hung in well-appointed parlors....they...provided a connection to Jewish heritage by linking the world of cosmopolitan Vienna to a traditional lifestyle that endured outside the capital.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/man-with-fur-hat/ZAHnngZnzTGp6A?projectId=art-project\">Source</a></span></span>But there was another answer to the paradox posed by modernity.&nbsp;Inspired by Mendelssohn, Jewish questioners throughout German-speaking lands in the early nineteenth century developed the Reform movement.&nbsp;These reformers believed that their mission was to bring Judaism in line with modern thought; they also promoted the idea that prayers should be chanted in the local language rather than in Hebrew.&nbsp;They encouraged rabbis to look beyond the Talmud and Torah for guidance. Reformers spurned the idea that the past could dictate a way of life in an increasingly secular and&nbsp;industrial&nbsp;context.&nbsp;They modeled many of their religious practices after German Christians&nbsp;encouraging&nbsp;&ldquo;decorum&rdquo; in synagogue, introducing&nbsp;music similar to that heard in churches, and many even wanted to switch the Sabbath to Sunday. They wanted to remain Jews, while highlighting Judaism&rsquo;s similarities with Christianity.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Orthodox movement</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These efforts infuriated traditionalists, who then reacted with steadfast conservatism.&nbsp; Some traditional rabbis had long opposed emancipation, but in response to the Reformers, a group of adherents to <em>Halakhah </em>codified the new Orthodox movement.&nbsp;They opposed many of the secular cultural forms that Judaism took in the coming decades: the Yiddishist movement, Zionism, and any other divergences from strict Halakhah. Some insisted that established customs not grounded in Jewish law should take on the weight of <em>Halakhah</em>&mdash;this is why some groups continue to dress and speak like their ancestors from a century ago or more.&nbsp; These extreme forms of observance are as much a product of modernity as Reform.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Hasidic Judaism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In Eastern Europe, another religious movement, called Hasidism, gained traction parallel to Reform and Orthodoxy.&nbsp;Founded in the eighteenth century by a rabbi and mystic who called himself Israel Baal Shem Tov, Hasidic Judaism grew out of a populist reaction to the elitism of the traditional Talmudic academy. Hasidic Judaism focuses on mystical interpretations of holy texts and the potential for uneducated Jews to experience holiness. The movement spread rapidly across Eastern and Central Europe. Hasidism&nbsp;gave rise to opposition from at least two sides: the traditional rabbinic legal structures that revolved around organized Torah study, and the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; Jews intent on both escaping the oppressive framework of the traditional Jewish family and acculturating into European society.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In spite of Hasidic Judaism&rsquo;s strained history with what came to be known as Orthodoxy, it has become harder to distinguish stringent Orthodox Jews from their Hasidic counterparts. As Reform Judaism gained popularity, the two groups joined forces in support of Halakhah and in opposition to radical reform. Known for their distinctive dress (beards, fur hats, sidelocks, and caftans for men), Hasidim are among the most visible Jewish groups.</p>\n"

It became part of the collection of the Great Synagogue of Danzig in the early 20th century. In 1939, it was sent to the Jewish Theological seminary in New York for safekeeping when the Nazis&#39; rise to power forced the Danzig Jewish community to disband.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/torah-crown/6gEqUFJXD4DlKw?projectId=art-project\">Source</a></span></span>Amidst political and economic turmoil in Western and Central Europe, nationalism&nbsp;became a rallying cry and pseudo-scientific&nbsp;ideas about&nbsp;race proliferated.&nbsp; A wave of antisemitism affected Jews within Europe and throughout the world in European&nbsp;colonies.

"\n"
"<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Zionism</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Several events from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries proved that Jews were not welcomed as equals. In Russia, violent pogroms and economic instability pushed over two million people to emigrate&nbsp;in the 1880s. The vast majority fled to North America, and a small fraction of pioneers traveled to Palestine, the site of ancient Judaism&rsquo;s origins. Some Jewish leaders, responding to the growing nationalism and antisemitism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, followed Theodor Herzl&nbsp;who advocated for a type of&nbsp;secular Jewish nationalism, a return to the biblical homeland of the Jewish people.&nbsp;Religious Jews had prayed facing Jerusalem and called for a Messianic return to the Land of Israel since the Second Temple was destroyed. But the modern political movement, known as Zionism, united the religious impulse to &ldquo;return&rdquo; with&nbsp;secular ideas about constructing a European-style nation for Jews.&nbsp;It is important to note that Zionism was but one form of Jewish nationalism that took hold in the nineteenth century. Some Jews fought for territorial and political autonomy on different parts of the globe, others fought for cultural autonomy in the nations where they lived. These Diaspora nationalist movements mostly disappeared in 1948 when Israel became an&nbsp;independent state.</p>\n"

"<h3>Holocaust</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&ldquo;The antisemite creates the Jew,&rdquo; wrote the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; Antisemitism had generated a false image of what a Jew is, making Jews seem like a social danger for the majority of Europeans. After World War I, liberal democracies everywhere appeared to be failing.&nbsp;The idea that Jews were responsible for social and economic crises convinced many&nbsp;to use race and ethnicity as a test to determine who&nbsp;belonged and who&nbsp;ought to be excluded.&nbsp;It was in this climate that the Nazi party was elected to power in 1933.&nbsp;Combining their expansionist vision with&nbsp;spurious theories of racial purity, the Germans quickly came to control most of central and eastern Europe.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Genocide became an everyday phenomenon&mdash;the Nuremburg Laws forced Jews to identify themselves with a badge, and criminalized sexual intimacy between Jews and gentiles. Laws were passed across Europe and the Mediterranean that excluded Jews from certain professions and the right to attend school.&nbsp;Citizenship was revoked and many people were&nbsp;forced&nbsp;from their homes into overcrowded wards.&nbsp;Inspired by the medieval ghetto, the Nazis went further&mdash;killing Jews by restricting food and medicine, packing thousands into spaces fit for far fewer, and, eventually, forbidding Jews to leave at all. Working in collaboration with governments across Europe, Nazi officials enacted a &ldquo;Final Solution&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Jewish Question&rdquo; in early 1942.&nbsp;Jews were forcibly&nbsp;gathered and shipped to local concentration camps and to death camps in Poland and Russia.&nbsp;Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.<br />\n"

"<h3>Vitally important, but difficult to interpret</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some artifacts are of such vital importance to our understanding of ancient cultures that they are truly unique and utterly irreplaceable. The gold mask of Tutankhamun was allowed to leave Egypt for display overseas; the <em>Narmer Palette</em>, on the other hand, is so valuable that it has never been permitted to leave the country.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Discovered among a group of sacred implements ritually buried in a deposit within an early temple of the falcon god Horus at the site of Hierakonpolis (the capital of Egypt during the pre-dynastic period), this large ceremonial object is one of the most important artifacts from the dawn of Egyptian civilization. The beautifully carved palette, 63.5 cm (more than 2 feet) in height and made of smooth greyish-green siltstone, is decorated on both faces with detailed low relief. These scenes show a king, identified by name as Narmer, and a series of ambiguous scenes that have been difficult to interpret and have resulted in a number of theories regarding their meaning.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The high quality of the workmanship, its original function as a ritual object dedicated to a god, and the complexity of the imagery clearly indicate that this was a significant object, but a satisfactory interpretation of the scenes has been elusive.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What was the palette used for?&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The object itself is a monumental version of a type of daily use item commonly found in the predynastic period&mdash;palettes were generally flat, minimally decorated stone objects used for grinding and mixing minerals for cosmetics. Dark eyeliner was an essential aspect of life in the sun-drenched region; like the dark streaks placed under the eyes of modern athletes, black cosmetic around the eyes served to reduce glare. Basic cosmetic palettes were among the typical grave goods found during this early era.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to these simple, purely functional, palettes however, there were also a number of larger, far more elaborate palettes created in this period. These objects still served the function of being a ground for grinding and mixing cosmetics, but they were also carefully carved with relief sculpture. Many of the earlier palettes display animals &mdash;some real, some fantastic&mdash;while later examples, like the Narmer palette, focus on human actions. Research suggests that these decorated palettes were used in temple ceremonies, perhaps to grind or mix makeup to be ritually applied to the image of the god. Later temple ritual included elaborate daily ceremonies involving the anointing and dressing of divine images; these palettes likely indicate an early incarnation of this process.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A ceremonial object, ritually buried&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The&nbsp;<em>Palette of Narmer</em>&nbsp;was discovered in 1898 by James Quibell and Frederick Green. It was found with a collection of other objects that had been used for ceremonial purposes and then ritually buried within the temple at Hierakonpolis.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Temple caches of this type are not uncommon. There was a great deal of focus on ritual and votive objects (offerings to the God) in temples. Every ruler, elite individual, and anyone else who could afford it, donated items to the temple to show their piety and increase their connection to the deity. After a period of time, the temple would be full of these objects and space would need to be cleared for new votive donations. However, since they had been dedicated to a temple and sanctified, the old items that needed to be cleared out could not simply be thrown away or sold. Instead, the general practice was to bury them in a pit under the temple floor. Often, these caches include objects from a range of dates and a mix of types, from royal statuary to furniture.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Conventions that remain the same for thousands of years</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are several reasons the&nbsp;<em>Narmer Palette</em>&nbsp;is considered to be of such importance. First, it is one of very few such palettes discovered in a controlled excavation. Second, there are a number of formal and iconographic characteristics appearing on the Narmer palette that remain conventional in Egyptian two-dimensional art for the following three millennia. These include the way the figures are represented, the scenes being organized in regular horizontal zones known as registers, and the use of hierarchical scale to indicate relative importance of the individuals. &nbsp;In addition, much of the regalia worn by the king, such as the crowns, kilts, royal beard, and bull tail, as well as other visual elements, such as the pose Narmer takes on one of the faces where he grasps an enemy by the hair and prepares to smash his skull with a mace, continue to be utilized from this time all the way through the Roman era. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagram of the Palette of Narmer\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/27bf72277f66037a77361248ad891229e17c12e3.jpeg\" /></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>What we see on the palette</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The king is represented twice in human form, once on each face, followed by his sandal-bearer. He may also be represented as a powerful bull, destroying a walled city with his massive horns, in a mode that again becomes conventional&mdash;pharaoh is regularly referred to as &quot;Strong Bull.&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In addition to the primary scenes, the palette includes a pair of fantastic creatures, known as serpopards&mdash;leopards with long, snaky necks&mdash;who are collared and controlled by a pair of attendants. Their necks entwine and define the recess where the makeup preparation took place. The lowest register on both sides include images of dead foes, while both uppermost registers display hybrid human-bull heads and the name of the king. The frontal bull heads are likely connected to a sky goddess known as Bat and are related to heaven and the horizon. The name of the king, written hieroglyphically as a catfish and a chisel, is contained within a squared element that represents a palace facade.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Possible interpretation: unification of Upper and Lower Egypt</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As mentioned above, there have been a number of theories related to the scenes carved on this palette. Some have interpreted the battle scenes as a historical narrative record of the initial unification of Egypt under one ruler, supported by the general timing (as this is the period of the unification) and the fact that Narmer sports the crown connected to Upper Egypt on one face of the palette and the crown of Lower Egypt on the other&mdash;this is the first preserved example where both crowns are used by the same ruler. Other theories suggest that, rather than an actual historical representation, these scenes were purely ceremonial and related to the concept of unification in general.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Another interpretation: the sun and the king</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>More recent research on the decorative program has connected the imagery to the careful balance of order and chaos (known as ma&rsquo;at and isfet) that was a fundamental element of the Egyptian idea of the cosmos. It may also be related to the daily journey of the sun god that becomes a central aspect in the Egyptian religion in the subsequent centuries.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The scene showing Narmer wearing the Lower Egyptian Red Crown (with its distinctive curl)* depicts him processing towards the decapitated bodies of his foes. The two rows of prone bodies are placed below an image of a high-prowed boat preparing to pass through an open gate. This may be an early reference to the journey of the sun god in his boat. In later texts, the Red Crown is connected with bloody battles fought by the sun god just before the rosy-fingered dawn on his daily journey and this scene may well be related to this. It is interesting to note that the foes are shown as not only executed, but rendered completely impotent&mdash;their castrated penises have been placed atop their severed heads.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>On the other face, Narmer wears the Upper Egyptian White Crown* (which looks rather like a bowling pin) as he grasps an inert foe by the hair and prepares to crush his skull. The White Crown is related to the dazzling brilliance of the full midday sun at its zenith as well as the luminous nocturnal light of the stars and moon. By wearing both crowns, Narmer may not only be ceremonially expressing his dominance over the unified Egypt, but also the early importance of the solar cycle and the king&rsquo;s role in this daily process.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This fascinating object is an incredible example of early Egyptian art. The imagery preserved on this palette provides a peek ahead to the richness of both the visual aspects and religious concepts that develop in the ensuing periods. It is a vitally important artifact of extreme significance for our understanding of the development of Egyptian culture on multiple levels.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>*The Red Crown of Lower Egypt and the White Crown of Upper Egypt were the earliest crowns worn by the king and are closely connected with the unification of the country that sparks full-blown Egyptian civilization. The earliest representation of them worn by the same ruler is on the&nbsp;<em>Narmer Palette</em>, signifying that the king was ruling over both areas of the country. Soon after the unification, the fifth ruler of the First Dynasty is shown wearing the two crowns simultaneously, combined into one. This crown, often referred to as the Double Crown, remains a primary crown worn by pharaoh throughout Egyptian history. The separate Red and White crowns, however, continue to be worn as well and retain their geographic connections. There are a number of Egyptian words used for these crowns (nine for the White and 11 for the Red), but the most common&mdash;deshret and hedjet&mdash;refer to the colors red and white, respectively. It is from these identifying terms that we take their modern name. Early texts make it clear that these crowns were believed to be imbued with divine power and were personified as goddesses.</p>\n"

"<h3>The subject of the Flagellation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s <em>Flagellation of Christ</em> is proof that, sometimes, good things really do come in small packages. Despite the panel&rsquo;s size (only 58.4&nbsp;cm &times;&nbsp;81.5&nbsp;cm), the painting has been a mainstay in the last century in discussions of Quattrocento (fifteenth century) painting. An early example of the use of oil paint&mdash;though Piero used both tempera and oil in its execution&mdash;the work depicts the moment in Christ&rsquo;s Passion when he was whipped before Pontius Pilate. Though the New Testament says very little about this moment, mentioning only that Pilate ordered Christ to be flogged, later Christian writers wrote much about the event, and even speculated about the number of lashes Christ received. Though the New Testament does not say that Christ was tied to a column while being whipped, during the fifteenth century this became a convention in depictions of the scene, which Piero here follows. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A masterpiece of the Early Renaissance</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This painting is a masterpiece of the early Renaissance. The figures are expressive; especially noteworthy is the face of the bearded man in the foreground. They are also given real volume through the use of modeling (the passage from light to dark over the surface of an object). True to Humanism, the painting shows a preoccupation with the Classical world, as seen especially in the architecture and inclusion of the golden statue in the background. Above all, Piero&rsquo;s obsession with perspective (the naturalistic recession in to space), is evident. In fact, the artist was the author of a treatise on perspective, entitled <em>De Perspectiva Pingendi</em> (<em>On the Perspective of Painting</em>) and was also known as a mathematician and geometer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Who are the men in the foreground?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s picture is also highly unusual. The flagellation, which is the gruesome main event, takes place in the background, while three extraneous men are painted prominently in the foreground. Piero uses two main devices to further emphasize the division of subjects. The first is setting. While the flagellation takes place inside of a covered courtyard with dramatic black and white checked tiles, the men are outdoors standing on the reddish tiles that pervade the scene. The second is the use of the orthogonal lines of the perspective, which divide the painting in half, and also delineate the interior and exterior space.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Not only is the painting strange because Piero marginalized the primary subject, relegating it to the back of the painting, but also because art historians cannot agree on who the three men in the foreground are. Theories abound. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The traditional identification of these three men is that the young man in the center is Oddantanio da Montefeltro, ruler of Urbino, flanked on either side by his advisors. &nbsp;All three of these men were killed in a conspiracy. In this case, it is suggested that the patron of the painting was Federigo da Montefeltro (who was later immortalized in a famous diptych by Piero) to commemorate his brother&rsquo;s death and compare his innocence to that of Christ. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historian Marilyn Lavin offered another notable interpretation of the painting. She suggested that the two older men are Ludovico Gonzaga and a friend, who had both recently lost their sons, symbolized by the young man in the center. The painting in this case would compare the pain that the two fathers felt to that of Christ during his Passion. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Other art historians have suggested that the painting is an allegory for the suffering of Constantinople after its fall to the Muslims in 1453. In this view, the two men watching the flagellation are Murad II (the Islamic sultan who waged a decades-long war against Christianity), and Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (against whom that war was waged). The emperor had gone to the 1438 Council of Florence to ask for protection from the Muslims, but received no aid. The three enigmatic men, then, represent nobles who stood by and let the Christian nation be destroyed. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Still another interpretation suggests that the key to understanding the painting lay in the lost inscription on the frame, which putatively said, &ldquo;Convenerunt in unum,&rdquo; or &ldquo;They come into one.&rdquo; This is a line from the Bible that was traditionally read each year on Good Friday, the day that commemorates Christ&rsquo;s Passion. &quot;They&rdquo; would refer then to the Sanhedrinists, or councilmen of Israel, who were present during Christ&rsquo;s suffering.

"\n"
"<h3>No definitive interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The enigmatic nature of Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s <em>Flagellation</em> underscores the fact that works of art, regardless of their age, continue to engender interesting art historical research. In the case of this painting, it is unlikely that a definitive interpretation will ever be accepted, as there is little documentation to support a single argument. Perhaps this ambiguity is partially why the painting continues to intrigue, and, almost 600 years later, grants multiple entry points to the viewer, drawing him into Piero&rsquo;s fictional world.</p>\n"

"This rare example of an Assyrian statue in the round was placed in the Temple of Ishtar Sharrat-niphi&nbsp;to remind the goddess Ishtar of the king&#39;s piety. Ashurnasirpal holds a sickle in his right hand, of a kind which gods are sometimes depicted using to fight monsters.

He was one of a line of energetic kings whose campaigns brought Assyria great wealth and established it as one of the Near East&#39;s major powers.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"Ashurnasirpal mounted at least fourteen military campaigns, many them were to the north and east of Assyria. Local rulers sent the king rich presents and resources flowed into the country. This wealth was ploughed into impressive building works undertaken in a new capital city created at Kalhu (modern Nimrud).

"\n"
"<h3>Construction: inner core stones, and outer casing stones</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The pyramid contains an estimated 2,300,000 blocks, some of which are upwards of 50 tons. Like the pyramids built by his predecessor Snefru and those that followed on the Giza plateau, Khufu&rsquo;s pyramid is constructed of inner, rough-hewn, locally quarried core stones, which is all we see today, and angled, outer casing blocks laid in even horizontal courses with spaces filled with gypsum plaster.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The fine outer casing stones, which have long since been removed, were laid with great precision. These blocks of white Tura limestone would have given the pyramid a smooth surface and been quite bright and reflective. At the very top of the pyramid would have sat a capstone, known as a pyramidion, that may have been gilt. This dazzling point, shining in the intense sunlight, would have been visible for a great distance.</p>\n"
"\n"

"<p>The interior chambers and passageways of Khufu&rsquo;s pyramid are unique and include a number of enigmatic features.

"<h3><span>Size</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Great Pyramid, the largest of the three, was built by the pharaoh Khufu and rises to a height of 146 meters (481 feet) with a base length of more than 230 meters (750 feet) per side. The greatest difference in length among the four sides is a mere 4.4 cm (1 &frac34; inches) and the base is level within 2.1 cm (less than an inch), an astonishing engineering accopmplishment.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Construction: inner core stones, and outer casing stones</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The pyramid contains an estimated 2,300,000 blocks, some of which are upwards of 50 tons. Like the pyramids built by his predecessor Snefru and those that followed on the Giza plateau, Khufu&rsquo;s pyramid is constructed of inner, rough-hewn, locally quarried core stones, which is all we see today, and angled, outer casing blocks laid in even horizontal courses with spaces filled with gypsum plaster.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The fine outer casing stones, which have long since been removed, were laid with great precision. These blocks of white Tura limestone would have given the pyramid a smooth surface and been quite bright and reflective. At the very top of the pyramid would have sat a capstone, known as a pyramidion, that may have been gilt. This dazzling point, shining in the intense sunlight, would have been visible for a great distance.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Interior</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The interior chambers and passageways of Khufu&rsquo;s pyramid are unique and include a number of enigmatic features. There is an unfinished subterranean chamber whose function is mysterious as well as a number of so-called &lsquo;air shafts&rsquo; that radiate out from the upper chambers.<br />\n"

"<h3>The oldest art: ornamentation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Humans make art. We do this for many reasons and with whatever technologies are available to us. Extremely old, non-representational ornamentation has been found across Africa. The oldest firmly-dated example is a collection of 82,000 year old Nassarius snail shells found in Morocco that are pierced and covered with red ochre. Wear patterns suggest that they may have been strung beads. Nassarius shell beads found in Israel may be more than 100,000 years old and in the Blombos cave in South Africa, pierced shells and small pieces of ochre (red Haematite) etched with simple geometric patterns have been found in a 75,000-year-old layer of sediment.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The oldest representational art</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The oldest known representational imagery comes from the Aurignacian culture of the Upper Paleolithic period (Paleolithic means old stone age). Archeological discoveries across a broad swath of Europe (especially Southern France, Northern Spain, and Swabia, in Germany) include over two hundred caves with spectacular Aurignacian paintings, drawings and sculpture that are among the earliest undisputed examples of representational image-making. The oldest of these is a 2.4-inch tall female figure carved out of mammoth ivory that was found in six fragments in the Hohle Fels cave near Schelklingen in southern Germany. It dates to 35,000 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The caves</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The caves at Chauvet-Pont-d&#39;Arc, Lascaux, Pech Merle, and Altamira contain the best known examples of pre-historic painting and drawing. Here are remarkably evocative renderings of animals and some humans that employ a complex mix of naturalism and abstraction. Archeologists that study Paleolithic era humans, believe that the paintings discovered in 1994, in the cave at Chauvet-Pont-d&#39;Arc in the Ard&eacute;che valley in France, are more than 30,000 years old. The images found at Lascaux and Altamira are more recent, dating to approximately 15,000 B.C.E. The paintings at Pech Merle date to both 25,000 and 15,000 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Questions</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What can we really know about the creators of these paintings and what the images originally meant? These are questions that are difficult enough when we study art made only 500 years ago. It is much more perilous to assert meaning for the art of people who shared our anatomy but had not yet developed the cultures or linguistic structures that shaped who we have become. Do the tools of art history even apply? Here is evidence of a visual language that collapses the more than 1,000 generations that separate us, but we must be cautious. This is especially so if we want to understand the people that made this art as a way to understand ourselves. The desire to speculate based on what we see and the physical evidence of the caves is wildly seductive.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Chauvet-Pont-d&#39;Arc</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The cave at Chauvet-Pont-d&#39;Arc is over 1,000 feet in length with two large chambers. Carbon samples date the charcoal used to depict the two head-to-head Rhinoceroses (see the image above, bottom right) to between 30,340 and 32,410 years before 1995 when the samples were taken. The cave&#39;s drawings depict other large animals including horses, mammoths, musk ox, ibex, reindeer, aurochs, megaceros deer, panther, and owl (scholars note that these animals were not then a normal part of people&#39;s diet). Photographs show that the drawing shown above is very carefully rendered but may be misleading. We see a group of horses, rhinos and bison and we see them as a group, overlapping and skewed in scale. But the photograph distorts the way these animal figures would have been originally seen. The bright electric lights used by the photographer create a broad flat scope of vision; how different to see each animal emerge from the dark under the flickering light cast by a flame.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A word of caution</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In a 2009 presentation at UC San Diego, Dr. Randell White, Professor of Anthropology at NYU, suggested that the overlapping horses pictured above might represent the same horse over time, running, eating, sleeping, etc. Perhaps these are far more sophisticated representations than we have imagined. There is another drawing at Chauvet-Pont-d&#39;Arc that cautions us against ready assumptions. It has been interpreted as depicting the thighs and genitals of a woman but there is also a drawing of a bison and a lion and the images are nearly intertwined. In addition to the drawings, the cave is littered with the skulls and bones of cave bear and the track of a wolf. There is also a foot print thought to have been made by an eight-year-old boy.<br />\n"

"<p>Conservators were able to reassess the old restoration when the vase was examined during gallery refurbishment in 1983.

Today, this type of resin is not considered appropriate for use on ceramic artifacts. It was decided that the vase would benefit from dismantling and reassembly using more stable and reversible conservation materials. Taking down the old joins and fills and manually cleaning away the polyester resin from fragments was a long process. The fragments were reassembled using a reversible adhesive and areas of loss were gap-filled using plaster of Paris and painted.</p>\n"

"<p>While today we consider the Greco-Roman period to be in the distant past, it should be noted that Cleopatra VII&#39;s reign (which ended in 30 BCE) is closer to our own time than it was to that of the construction of the pyramids of Giza.

"<h3>Consistency &amp; Stability</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Egypt&rsquo;s stability is in stark contrast to the Ancient Near East of the same period, which endured an overlapping series of cultures and upheavals with amazing regularity. The earliest royal monuments, such as the Narmer Palette carved around 3100 B.C.E., display identical royal costumes and poses as those seen on later rulers, even Ptolemaic kings on their temples 3000 years later.</p>\n"

"<p>A vast amount of Egyptian imagery, especially royal imagery that was governed by decorum (a sense of what was &lsquo;appropriate&rsquo;), remained stupefyingly consistent throughout its history. This is why, especially to the untrained eye, their art appears extremely static&mdash;and in terms of symbols, gestures, and the way the body is rendered, it was. It was intentional. The Egyptians were aware of their consistency, which they viewed as stability, divine balance, and clear evidence of the correctness of their culture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This consistency was closely related to a fundamental belief that depictions had an impact beyond the image itself&mdash;tomb scenes of the deceased receiving food, or temple scenes of the king performing perfect rituals for the gods&mdash;were functionally causing those things to occur in the divine realm. If the image of the bread loaf was omitted from the deceased&rsquo;s table, they had no bread in the Afterlife; if the king was depicted with the incorrect ritual implement, the ritual was incorrect and this could have dire consequences. This belief led to an active resistance to change in codified depictions.</p>\n"

"<p>The earliest recorded tourist graffiti on the planet came from a visitor from the time of Ramses II who left their appreciative mark at the already 1300-year-old site of the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, the earliest of the massive royal stone monuments.

"<h3>Geography</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Egypt is a land of duality and cycles, both in topography and culture. The geography is almost entirely rugged, barren desert, except for an explosion of green that straddles either side of the Nile as it flows the length of the country. The river emerges from far to the south, deep in Africa, and empties into the Mediterranean sea in the north after spreading from a single channel into a fan-shaped system, known as a delta, at its northernmost section.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The influence of this river on Egyptian culture and development cannot be overstated&mdash;without its presence, the civilization would have been entirely different, and most likely entirely elsewhere. The Nile provided not only a constant source of life-giving water, but created the fertile lands that fed the growth of this unique (and uniquely resilient) culture.</p>\n"

They divided the year into 3 seasons: akhet &quot;inundation,&quot; peret &quot;growing/emergence.&quot;&nbsp;and shemw &quot;harvest.&quot;&nbsp;Each season was, in turn, divided into four 30-day months. Although this annual cycle, paired with the daily solar cycle that is so evident in the desert, led to a powerful drive to see the universe in cyclical time, this idea existed simultaneously with the reality of linear time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These two concepts&mdash;the cyclical and the linear&mdash;came to be associated with two of their primary deities: Osiris, the eternal lord of the dead, and Re, the sun god who was reborn with each dawn.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Early Development: The Predynastic Period</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The civilization of Egypt obviously did not spring fully formed from the Nile mud; although the massive pyramids at Giza may appear to the uninitiated to have appeared out of nowhere, they were founded on thousands of years of cultural and technological development and experimentation. &quot;Dynastic&quot;&nbsp;Egypt&mdash;sometimes referred to as &quot;Pharaonic&quot;&nbsp;(after &quot;pharaoh,&quot; the Greek title of the Egyptian kings derived from the Egyptian title <em>per aA</em>, &quot;Great House&quot;) which was the time when the country was largely unified under a single ruler, begins around 3100 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The period before this, lasting from about 5000 B.C.E. until unification, is referred to as Predynastic by modern scholars. Prior to this were thriving Paleolithic and Neolithic groups, stretching back hundreds of thousands of years, descended from northward migrating homo erectus who settled along the Nile Valley. During the Predynastic period, ceramics, figurines, mace heads, and other artifacts such as slate palettes used for grinding pigments, begin to appear, as does imagery that will become iconic during the Pharaonic era&mdash;we can see the first hints of what is to come.</p>\n"

"<p>It is important to recognize that the dynastic divisions modern scholars use were not used by the ancients themselves. These divisions were created in the first Western-style history of Egypt, written by an Egyptian priest named Manetho in the 3rd century B.C.E. Each of the 33 dynasties included a series of rulers usually related by kinship or the location of their seat of power. Egyptian history is also divided into larger chunks, known as &quot;kingdoms&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;periods,&quot; to distinguish times of strength and unity from those of change, foreign rule, or disunity.</p>\n"

"<p>The Egyptians themselves referred to their history in relation to the ruler of the time. Years were generally recorded as the regnal dates (from the Latin regnum, meaning kingdom or rule) of the ruling king, so that with each new reign, the numbers began anew. Later kings recorded the names of their predecessors in vast &quot;king-lists&quot;&nbsp;on the walls of their temples and depicted themselves offering to the rulers who came before them&mdash;one of the best known examples is in the temple of Seti I at Abydos.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>These lists were often condensed, with some rulers (such as the contentious and disruptive Akhenaten) and even entire dynasties omitted from the record; they are not truly history, rather they are a form of ancestor worship, a celebration of the consistency of kingship of which the current ruler was a part.</p>\n"

"<h3>The Pharaoh&mdash;Not Just a King</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Kings in Egypt were complex intermediaries that straddled the terrestrial and divine realms. They were, obviously, living humans, but upon accession to the throne, they also embodied the eternal office of kingship itself. The ka, or spirit, of kingship was often depicted as a separate entity standing behind the human ruler. This divine aspect of the office of kingship was what gave authority to the human ruler. The living king was associated with the god Horus, the powerful, virile falcon-headed god who was believed to bestow the throne to the first human king.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Horus&rsquo;s immensely important father, Osiris, was the lord of the underworld. One of the original divine rulers of Egypt, this deity embodied the promise of regeneration. Cruelly murdered by his brother Seth, the god of the chaotic desert, Osiris was revived through the potent magic of his wife Isis. Through her knowledge and skill, Osiris was able to sire the miraculous Horus, who avenged his father and threw his criminal uncle off the throne to take his rightful place.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Osiris became ruler of the realm of the dead, the eternal source of regeneration in the Afterlife. Deceased kings were identified with this god, creating a cycle where the dead king fused with the divine king of the dead and his successor &quot;defeated&quot;&nbsp;death to take his place on the throne as Horus.</p>\n"

"<p>The underground terracotta army found in the First Emperor&rsquo;s burial complex is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable and mysterious discoveries from the ancient world.&nbsp;A sprawling citadel has been unearthed, complete with gardens and stables, bronze ritual vessels, jade jewelry, and a wealth of gold and silver ornaments.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Besides revealing much about an ancient way of life, observing the physical construction of the underground complex and the methodical production of the figures reveals a set of themes from which we gain a window of insight to the First Emperor&rsquo;s worldview and enduring influence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Innovation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The First Emperor<span>&nbsp;known for stunning innovations that consolidated his rule through modernization. During his reign, he introduced the standardization of currency, writing, measurements and more. He connected cities and states with advanced systems of roads and canals. He is also credited with continuing the construction of the Great Wall, which is perhaps the most widely-known symbol still associated with China to this day.</span><br />\n"

"<p>Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the burial complex is what it suggests about the young Emperor&rsquo;s obsession with immortality.&nbsp;Driven to conquer death itself, the eventual First Emperor ascended to the throne of the Qin state at age of 13 and immediately began to plan his burial, and more importantly, his underground palace, a mausoleum attended by&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>According to Han-dynasty historian Sima Qian, the First Emperor lined his burial complex with a treasury of riches and piles of precious gemstones said to represent the stars, sun and moon. He was deeply concerned with the universe and looked to the cosmos as a guide for crossing over to an immortal existence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Excavation also revealed other mysterious findings, like strangely high levels of mercury and evidence that the poisonous substance coursed through an intricate system of underground troughs, replicating the topography of the actual rivers and seas carving the surrounding landscape. Some suggest that the emperor believed mercury had life-giving power and so surrounded himself with the toxic element, believing it was yet another way he might live forever.</p>\n"

"<h3>Unification</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of all the accomplishments from this extraordinary period, the unification of China is, without question, the greatest symbol of the Qin dynasty&rsquo;s power and influence.&nbsp;Born in a time of turmoil in China&#39;s history, known as the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.E.), The First Emperor founded the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 B.C.E.). By 221 B.C.E., he merged the seven warring states into one nation and took the name Qin Shihuang, which means First Emperor. He left a legacy of a centralized and bureaucratic state that would be carried onto successive dynasties over the next two millennia.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>The First Emperor</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Qin Shihuang (259-210 B.C.E.) conquered much in this life, but his driving purpose was even greater;&nbsp;he sought to conquer death.&nbsp;In order to achieve immortality, he built himself a tomb&mdash;a vast underground city guarded by a life-size terracotta army including warriors, infantrymen, horses, chariots and all their attendant armor and weaponry.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The underground terracotta army found in the First Emperor&rsquo;s burial complex is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable and mysterious discoveries from the ancient world.&nbsp;A sprawling citadel has been unearthed, complete with gardens and stables, bronze ritual vessels, jade jewelry, and a wealth of gold and silver ornaments.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Besides revealing much about an ancient way of life, observing the physical construction of the underground complex and the methodical production of the figures reveals a set of themes from which we gain a window of insight to the First Emperor&rsquo;s worldview and enduring influence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Innovation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The First Emperor<span>&nbsp;known for stunning innovations that consolidated his rule through modernization. During his reign, he introduced the standardization of currency, writing, measurements and more. He connected cities and states with advanced systems of roads and canals. He is also credited with continuing the construction of the Great Wall, which is perhaps the most widely-known symbol still associated with China to this day.</span><br />\n"
"<br />\n"

"\n"
"<p>He is regarded as a military genius, and while his methods included massacre and destruction, some claim that his ultimate success at bringing the states together justifies the violence, a necessary cost of nation-building. We also see&nbsp;the first assembly-line style production in the creation of his terracotta warriors, horses and chariots.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Immortality</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the burial complex is what it suggests about the young Emperor&rsquo;s obsession with immortality.&nbsp;Driven to conquer death itself, the eventual First Emperor ascended to the throne of the Qin state at age of 13 and immediately began to plan his burial, and more importantly, his underground palace, a mausoleum attended by&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2c4d8eb2cb887feb626874cfa6306d928bd26dd4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Terracotta warriors from the mausoleum of the first Qin emperor of China Qin Shihuang, c. 221-206 B.C.E., Qin Dynasty, painted terracotta, Terracotta Warriors and Horses Museum, Shaanxi, China (photo: <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/8bByLC\">NekaPearl</a>, CC: BY-NC 2.0)</span></span>an army including over 7,000 terracotta warriors horses, chariots and weaponry intended to protect him in the afterlife.&nbsp;The First Emperor envisioned a subterranean domain that would parallel his worldly existence after corporal death.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>According to Han-dynasty historian Sima Qian, the First Emperor lined his burial complex with a treasury of riches and piles of precious gemstones said to represent the stars, sun and moon. He was deeply concerned with the universe and looked to the cosmos as a guide for crossing over to an immortal existence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Excavation also revealed other mysterious findings, like strangely high levels of mercury and evidence that the poisonous substance coursed through an intricate system of underground troughs, replicating the topography of the actual rivers and seas carving the surrounding landscape. Some suggest that the emperor believed mercury had life-giving power and so surrounded himself with the toxic element, believing it was yet another way he might live forever.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Unification</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Of all the accomplishments from this extraordinary period, the unification of China is, without question, the greatest symbol of the Qin dynasty&rsquo;s power and influence.&nbsp;Born in a time of turmoil in China&#39;s history, known as the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.E.), The First Emperor founded the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 B.C.E.). By 221 B.C.E., he merged the seven warring states into one nation and took the name Qin Shihuang, which means First Emperor. He left a legacy of a centralized and bureaucratic state that would be carried onto successive dynasties over the next two millennia.</p>\n"

"<h3>Boom times in Florence</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The city-state of Florence in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries was a city on the rise. Urbanization was experienced by all Italian cities at this time and Florence&rsquo;s population doubled in size. But more than almost any other town, Florence saw an explosion in international trade and innovations in finance. A new class of bankers and merchants replaced the old noble families as the center of power, developing a complex, barely democratic social structure that hung in a careful balance.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"View of Palazzo della Signoria, 1299-1310, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ed62d6c1d186e237b36c66eb2f3d38bda01ce547.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">View of Palazzo della Signoria, 1299-1310, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art and architecture helped define the relationships between individuals and the bewildering array of civic, professional, and religious institutions that made up the fabric of Florentine society. Thanks to the city&rsquo;s newfound wealth, impressive communal building projects were undertaken, like the building of a new seat of government, the Palazzo della Signoria.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Church and state&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During this building boom, church and state were anything but separate. Public funds were used to erect many of the religious centers, including the cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. Subsidies were even given over to the large new churches needed to accommodate growing audiences for the sermons of the mendicant orders (monks that had forsaken worldly possessions and that lived and preached in the cities). The largest of these mendicant behemoths were the Franciscan church of Santa Croce and the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Guilds and private patrons too&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Happily, the decoration of buildings throughout the city fell to a widening range of patrons. Professional guilds (somewhat like our trade unions) were often in charge of decorating public spaces with painting and, increasingly, architectural sculpture. Groups of priests, nuns, and confraternities (organizations of laypeople that gathered to perform acts of charity or sing hymns) hired artists to create devotional images and lavish books of hymns. For the first time, wealthy individuals and families could even purchase the rights to use and decorate chapels within a church.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A more personal spirituality</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>But art was not all about public displays of wealth or works of communal beautification. Faith and spirituality became more deeply personal even as they became more public. More than in previous centuries, images played an important role in focusing a person&rsquo;s devotion to Christ, Mary and the saints&mdash;in imagining their lives or picturing how they might appear in all their heavenly glory. In fact, images didn&rsquo;t just maintain relationships within Florentine society, they built imagined relationships between viewers and the sacred figures they portrayed. This affected more than just the amount of art people needed; it affected what they wanted it to look like. And in the course of the fourteenth century, what they wanted it to look like would change dramatically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Italo-Byzantine style</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Coppo di Marcovaldo and his son Salerno, Crucifixion, 1274 (Pistoia Cathedral)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d47dafe9fd25ad5ca42d1bf43040ea05c76af576.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Coppo di Marcovaldo and his son Salerno, <em>Crucifixion</em>, 1274 (Pistoia Cathedral)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like the art of most Italian cities at the time, thirteenth-century art in Florence was heavily influenced by Byzantine art (the art of the Byzantine Empire). Images from this period are in fact often described as &ldquo;Italo-Byzantine,&rdquo; a label that reflects how artists such as Coppo di Marcovaldo (and many more artists whose names we don&rsquo;t know) adapted the foreign style into something altogether Italian.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In painting, this meant emulating the way figures were strongly outlined against glittering gold backgrounds like those seen in Byzantine icons and mosaics. These ornate images seem to directly engage the viewer by pressing whatever is being depicted by the artist to the surface of the painting or mosaic. Figures are formed out of abstract but expressive shapes designed to identify various body parts or items of clothing while creating beautiful patterns. In narrative images, each story plays out across the field of representation instead of within it, eliminating the need for a sense of depth.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Cimabue, Santa Trinita Madonna (Madonna and Child Enthroned), 1280-90 tempera on panel (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/337136f84864b1990f529261ce815399bcae209e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Cimabue,<em> Santa Trinita Madonna (Madonna and Child Enthroned)</em>, 1280-90 tempera on panel (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>A new style emerges&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the late thirteenth century, artists in a handful of Italian cities began to move away from the Italo-Byzantine style. The Roman artist Pietro Cavallini created frescoes and mosaics featuring solid, monumentalizing figures; the sculptor Nicola Pisano studied ancient Roman sculpture; Sienese artists seem to have broken new ground in exploring perspective. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, back in Florence, Cimabue&rsquo;s paintings showed more interest in depicting space and modeling figures with gradations of light and shade. These ideas spread as artists travelled throughout Italy and southern France in search of work, creating a network of artistic centers that all exerted influence on one another.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Giotto di Bondone, The Ognissanti Madonna, 1306-10, tempera on panel, 128 x 80 1/4&quot; or 325 x 204 cm (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/9afde9efa4109d1a56e7e6e00e5ae316d10c76a9.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Giotto di Bondone, <em>The Ognissanti Madonna</em>, 1306-10, tempera on panel, 128 x 80 1/4&quot; or 325 x 204 cm (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence)</span></span>Giotto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As the new century opened, the painter Giotto di Bondone observed many of these currents and forged them into something distinctively Florentine and enormously influential.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where earlier works of art engage us with the embellished splendor of the heavenly, Giotto&rsquo;s paintings capture our attention by representing holy figures and stories as if in a majestic but earthly realm. Bold modeling of draperies and the bodies beneath them gives his figures greater volume and a sense of sculptural relief. Clever kinds of perspective create the illusion that a space is opening up in front of the viewer, as if we might be peering onto a stage.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Giotto, Meeting at the Golden Gate, Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel, Padua, c. 1305\n"

"\n"
"<p>Perhaps just as importantly, Giotto was a master of visual storytelling &ndash; a skill evident in his most important surviving project, the frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua (c. 1305). Here the monumentality of the figures, the quiet dignity of their movements, and the way architectural and landscape settings seem to echo the action all conjure up a solemn aura of the sacred. Like many of the narrative paintings attributed to Giotto, the scenes use closely observed human gestures and careful composition to enhance the drama and emotion of the moment depicted.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Art after Giotto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Giotto had an enormous workshop full of students and assistants, making it hard to tell which works he painted and which were by his pupils. Even more confusingly, his style was so immediately influential that it is still difficult to say who his formal students were. What we do know is that, in the years immediately after his death, the artists who were the most &ldquo;Giottesque&rdquo; received the lion&rsquo;s share of the important commissions for new projects. The success of artists like Bernardo Daddi, Maso di Banco, and Taddeo Gaddi demonstrates that wealthy patrons were on board with Giotto&rsquo;s new vision for art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sometime around mid-century, though, certain artists began to drift from the clear, spare art of Giotto&rsquo;s school. Many experimented with visually crowded compositions or with complex subjects represented through elaborate symbols and schemes. Some even seem to have purposefully echoed the ornamental, formal art of the Italo-Byzantine period. This has led art historians to wonder whether these changes in style were caused by Florence&rsquo;s collective despair after the outbreak of the bubonic plague&mdash;a sickness that wiped out over half the city&rsquo;s population in one year alone (1348).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e0bdde432f8605b350f3356d14877e7943773d81.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most scholars now think the situation was more mixed than this theory might lead us to believe. In fact, late fourteenth-century art is hard to generalize. This is partly because no single workshop dominated the art of Florence as much as Giotto and his school had in previous decades. But it is also because artists of the time were skilled at adapting their own style to the specific tastes of each patron and to the context and function of each image.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Overall, however, Florentine art from 1348 to 1400 did not experience the same kind of major stylistic shift that characterized Giotto&rsquo;s years on the scene. Rather, the fundamental influence of Giotto continued into the early 1400s. In the end, the long fourteenth-century was Giotto&rsquo;s century.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>During the late thirteenth century, artists in a handful of Italian cities began to move away from the Italo-Byzantine style. The Roman artist Pietro Cavallini created frescoes and mosaics featuring solid, monumentalizing figures; the sculptor Nicola Pisano studied ancient Roman sculpture; Sienese artists seem to have broken new ground in exploring perspective. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Meanwhile, back in Florence, Cimabue&rsquo;s paintings showed more interest in depicting space and modeling figures with gradations of light and shade. These ideas spread as artists travelled throughout Italy and southern France in search of work, creating a network of artistic centers that all exerted influence on one another.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>As the new century opened, the painter Giotto di Bondone observed many of these currents and forged them into something distinctively Florentine and enormously influential.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Where earlier works of art engage us with the embellished splendor of the heavenly, Giotto&rsquo;s paintings capture our attention by representing holy figures and stories as if in a majestic but earthly realm. Bold modeling of draperies and the bodies beneath them gives his figures greater volume and a sense of sculptural relief. Clever kinds of perspective create the illusion that a space is opening up in front of the viewer, as if we might be peering onto a stage.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Perhaps just as importantly, Giotto was a master of visual storytelling &ndash; a skill evident in his most important surviving project, the frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua (c. 1305). Here the monumentality of the figures, the quiet dignity of their movements, and the way architectural and landscape settings seem to echo the action all conjure up a solemn aura of the sacred. Like many of the narrative paintings attributed to Giotto, the scenes use closely observed human gestures and careful composition to enhance the drama and emotion of the moment depicted.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Art after Giotto</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Giotto had an enormous workshop full of students and assistants, making it hard to tell which works he painted and which were by his pupils. Even more confusingly, his style was so immediately influential that it is still difficult to say who his formal students were. What we do know is that, in the years immediately after his death, the artists who were the most &ldquo;Giottesque&rdquo; received the lion&rsquo;s share of the important commissions for new projects. The success of artists like Bernardo Daddi, Maso di Banco, and Taddeo Gaddi demonstrates that wealthy patrons were on board with Giotto&rsquo;s new vision for art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sometime around mid-century, though, certain artists began to drift from the clear, spare art of Giotto&rsquo;s school. Many experimented with visually crowded compositions or with complex subjects represented through elaborate symbols and schemes. Some even seem to have purposefully echoed the ornamental, formal art of the Italo-Byzantine period. This has led art historians to wonder whether these changes in style were caused by Florence&rsquo;s collective despair after the outbreak of the bubonic plague&mdash;a sickness that wiped out over half the city&rsquo;s population in one year alone (1348).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e0bdde432f8605b350f3356d14877e7943773d81.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Andrea Bonaiuti, Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, c. 1365-67, Guidalotti Chapel (Spanish Chapel) (Santa Maria Novella, Florence)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Most scholars now think the situation was more mixed than this theory might lead us to believe. In fact, late fourteenth-century art is hard to generalize. This is partly because no single workshop dominated the art of Florence as much as Giotto and his school had in previous decades. But it is also because artists of the time were skilled at adapting their own style to the specific tastes of each patron and to the context and function of each image.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Overall, however, Florentine art from 1348 to 1400 did not experience the same kind of major stylistic shift that characterized Giotto&rsquo;s years on the scene. Rather, the fundamental influence of Giotto continued into the early 1400s. In the end, the long fourteenth-century was Giotto&rsquo;s century.</p>\n"

"<p>The Maori built meeting houses&nbsp;before the period of contact with Europeans. The early structures appear to have been used as the homes of chiefs, though they were also used for accommodating guests. They did not exist in every community. From the middle of the nineteenth century, however, they started to develop into an important focal point of local society. Larger meeting houses were built, and they ceased to be used as homes. The open space in front of the house, known as a&nbsp;<em>marae</em>, is used as an assembly ground.&nbsp;They were, and still are, used for entertaining, for funerals, religious and political meetings.&nbsp;It is a focus of tribal pride and is treated with great respect.<br />\n"

"<p>But the emperor also commissioned small private works of art such as gems, and cameos. Unlike art in the public sphere, private art would not have been seen by a large audience. Instead, only a select few would have been granted access. If you were lucky enough to be invited to a dinner party at the emperor&rsquo;s palace, he might display his gem collection or show off his large imperial cameos. However, despite the fact that private art would not have been seen by the majority of Roman citizens, the messages contained within these works would have functioned in much the same way as their public counterparts. So if you were at that dinner party with Augustus and he showed you a large cameo, that cameo would have advertised the emperor&rsquo;s military victories, his role as the bringer of peace, and his connection to the gods.</p>\n"

"<p>Cameos were a popular medium in the private art of the Roman Empire. While cameos first appeared in the Hellenistic period, they became most fashionable under the Romans. Typically cameos were made of a brown stone that had bands or layers of white throughout, such as sardonyx. This layered stone was then carved in such a way that the figures stood out in white relief while the background remained the dark part of the stone. Most cameos were small and functioned as pendants or rings. But there are a few examples of much larger cameos that were specifically commissioned by the emperor and members of his imperial circle, the most famous example is the Gemma Augustea.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Gemma Augustea</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Gemma Augustea is divided into two registers that are crammed with figures and iconography. The upper register contains three historical figures and a host of deities and personifications. Our eyes immediately gravitate towards the center of the upper register and the two large enthroned figures, Roma (the personification of the city of Rome) and the emperor Augustus. Roma is surrounded by military paraphernalia while Augustus holds a scepter, a symbol of his right to rule and his role as the leader of the Roman Empire. At his feet is an eagle, a symbol of the god Jupiter and so we quickly realize that Augustus has close ties to the gods. Augustus is depicted as a heroic semi-nude, a convention usually reserved for deities. Augustus is not only stating that he has connections to gods, he is stating that he is also god-like.</p>\n"

"<p>Two other historical figures accompany Augustus in the upper register. At the far left is Tiberius, who will eventually succeed Augustus on the throne. To the right of Tiberius is the young Germanicus, another member of Augustus&rsquo; family and a potential heir to the throne.

"\n"
"<p>Interspersed amongst the three historical figures of the upper register are deities and personifications. Directly behind Tiberius is winged Victory. Behind Augustus is Oikoumene, the personification of the civilized world, who places a corona civica (civic crown) on the emperor&rsquo;s head. In the Roman Empire, it was a great honor to be awarded the civic crown as it was only given to someone who had saved Roman citizens from an enemy (and Augustus had certainly done just that by rescuing Romans from civil war). Oceanus, the personification of the oceans, sits on the far right. Finally, Tellus Italiae, the mother earth goddess and personification of Italy, sits with her two chubby children and holds a cornucopia.</p>\n"

"<p>What does the top register mean, with its grouping of mortals, deities, and personifications? In short, everything praises Augustus. The emperor expresses his domination throughout the Roman Empire and his greatest accomplishment, the pacification of the Roman world, which resulted in fertility and prosperity. Augustus&rsquo; peace and dominion will spread not only throughout the city of Rome (represented by the goddess Roma), but also to all of Italy (represented by Tellus Italiae) and throughout the entire civilized world (symbolized by Oikoumene).

In his summary, Plautus gives the reader the sense that one could find just about every sort of person in the forum&mdash;from criminals and hustlers to politicians and&nbsp;prostitutes. His summary reminds us that in the city of Rome the Forum Romanum was the key political, ritual, and civic center. Located in a valley separating the Capitoline and Palatine Hills, the Forum developed from the earliest times and remained in use after the city&rsquo;s eventual decline; during that span of time the forum witnessed the growth and eventual contraction of the city and her empire.&nbsp;The archaeological remains of the Forum Romanum&nbsp;itself continue to provide important insights into the phases and processes associated with urbanism and monumentality in ancient Rome.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The traditional foundation narrative holds that one of the first acts of Romulus, the city&rsquo;s eponymous founder, was to establish a fortification wall around the Palatine Hill, the site of his new settlement. The Capitoline Hill, opposite the Palatine, emerged as the city&rsquo;s citadel (<em>arx</em>) and site of the poliadic cult of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, among others (poliadic:&nbsp;the chief civic cult of an ancient city, derived from the Greek word &quot;polis&quot;).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Iron Age populations had used the marshy valley separating the Palatine and Capitoline hills as a necropolis (a large ancient cemetery), but the burgeoning settlement of archaic Rome had need of communal space and the valley was repurposed from a necropolis to a usable space. This required several transformations, both of human activity and the natural environment. Burial activity&nbsp;had to be transferred elsewhere; for this reason the main necropolis site shifted to the far side of the Esquiline Hill.<br />\n"

Since the Tiber river tended to leave its banks regularly, the valley was prone to significant flooding, as a low saddle of land known as the Velabrum connects the forum valley to the riverine zone. As coring studies conducted&nbsp;by Albert J. Ammerman have shown, a deliberate landfill project deposited fill in the forum valley in order to create usable, dry levels during the sixth century B.C.E. Twentieth century excavators, including Giacomo Boni and Einar Gjerstad, revealed important remains of Iron Age burials that pre-dated the establishment of the forum valley as a civic space; in particular the necropolis in the area known as the <em>Sepulcretum</em> along the Sacra Via (&quot;Sacred Way,&quot; the&nbsp;main sacred processional road of the city)&nbsp;has been extensively studied and published.&nbsp;The investigations of the burials themselves, and the patterns they followed, have allowed archaeologists to understand not only funeral customs but also social dynamics during Rome&rsquo;s proto-urban phases.<br />\n"

"<p>This major investment in the creation of civic space and the organization of labor also provides important information about the socio-economic structure of early Rome (Livy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi0011.perseus-eng3\">1.59.9</a>). The drainage canal eventually came to have a vaulted covering and was known as the <em>Cloaca Maxima</em> or &quot;Great Drain.&quot;&nbsp;One of the clear outcomes of these civic investments was the creation of a usable space that came to be a civic focus for activities in many spheres, especially political and sacred functions.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Temples and sacred buildings</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the Early Republican period the forum space saw the construction of key temples. One of the most prominent early temples is the Temple of Saturn (often considered the earliest of the temples in the Forum Romanum), the first iteration of which dates c. 498 B.C.E. The temple was dedicated to Saturn, the god of agriculture, and housed the state treasury. The temple was rebuilt in 42 B.C.E. and again after 283 C.E. Another early Republican temple is the Temple of the Castors (a.k.a. Temple of Castor and Pollux) that was completed in 484 B.C.E. and was dedicated to the Gemini who had aided the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 B.C.E. The temple had several construction phases. The Sacra Via&nbsp;passed along the forum square en route to the Capitoline Hill and the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. This sacred route was used for certain state-level ceremonies, especially the celebration of the victory ritual known as the Roman triumph.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Temple of Vesta\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8a44fb3981a08f0458e14bb1cf92414c195a9bcf.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Temple of Vesta</span></span>Two other early, sacred buildings are important to note. These are the Regia or &quot;king&rsquo;s house&quot;&nbsp;and the Temple of Vesta, both located on the downward slope of the Palatine Hill near the point where it reaches the edge of the Forum Romanum proper. Both of these sacred buildings are quite ancient and had many building phases, making it difficult to refine the chronology of the earliest phases. The Regia served as a ceremonial home for the king&mdash;later passing into the ownership of the pontifex maximus (principal state-level priesthood) once the kings had been expelled&mdash;and consisted of an irregularly planned suite of rooms surrounding a courtyard. The sixth century B.C.E. phase was decorated with painted plaques of architectural terracotta, clearly indicating both elite function and investment. Across the way was the Temple of Vesta, focused on the maternal elements of the archaic state as well as safeguarding the cult of Vesta and the sacred, eternal hearth flame of the Roman people. Both the Regia and the Temple of Vesta developed from crude structures in earlier phases to stone-built architecture in later phases. The Severan family carried out the final significant&nbsp;restoration of the Temple of Vesta in 191 C.E..</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Meeting spaces</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Important meeting spaces for political bodies emerged at the northwest side of the forum, namely a pair of complexes known as the Curia and Comitium. The Curia served as the council house for the Roman Senate, although the Senate could convene in any inaugurated space (i.e. a space ritually demarcated by Roman priests). The Curia emerged perhaps in the seventh century B.C.E., although little is known about its earliest phases. The surviving Curia is an imperial rebuilding of the Late Republican phase known as the Curia Julia, since Julius Caesar was its architectural patron. The Comitium was a tiered space that lay in front of the Curia that served as an open-air meeting space for public assemblies. Little of the Comitium remains today but it was a key architectural complex for political and sacred events during the time of the Roman Republic.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>From Republic to Empire</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the fourth and third centuries B.C.E. the Forum Romanum certainly continued to develop, but material remains of large-scale architecture have proven elusive and thus our understanding of the space during those centuries is less clear than in other periods. One middle Republican development is the continued elaboration of the Rostra, the platform from which orators would speak to those assembled in the forum square. This monument would continue to develop over time and took its name from the prows (<em>rostra</em>) of defeated enemy warships that were mounted on its fa&ccedil;ade.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The later second and first centuries B.C.E., the Late Republican period, witnessed many changes in the city and in the Forum Romanum. The successes of Rome and her growing empire during the second and first centuries B.C.E. led to a great deal of monumental construction in the city, including in the Forum Romanum itself. It was during this Late Republican phase that Rome became a metropolitan center, equipped with the monumental architecture that could compete with&mdash;if not eclipse&mdash;that of the foreign powers Rome had tamed during the Punic Wars and those against the Hellenistic kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean. In particular the Romans established a&nbsp;tradition of constructing monuments commemorating famous men who had achieved great success in military and public careers. The first of these was the <em>Columna Rostrata</em> that marked the naval victory of Caius Duilius at the naval battle of Mylae in 260 B.C.E. The Roman interest in monumental, commemorative monuments, now referred to as triumphal arches, would soon follow.&nbsp;The first of these, the Fabian arch (<em>fornix Fabianus</em>), was dedicated on the Sacra Via toward the eastern end of the Forum Romanum in 121 B.C.E., commemorating the military victories (and family) of Quintus Fabius Allobrogicus (Cicero <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/474/28/0#4\">pro Planc. 17</a>). While the Fabian monument is no longer extant, its construction established a tradition&nbsp;(and a traditional form) for official commemorative and honorific monuments in the context of Roman public art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Basilica</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The second century B.C.E. saw the creation and introduction of a unique Roman building type, the basilica. The basilica was a columnar hall that often had a multi-purpose use&mdash;from law courts to commerce to entertainments. Roman planners came to prefer them for lining the long sides of open squares, in a way not dissimilar from the Greek stoa. The sources claim that the Basilica Porcia (c. 184 B.C.E.) was the first basilica built at Rome, although no trace of it remains. The Basilica Porcia served as an office for the tribunes of the plebs. Other, more elaborate basilicae were soon to be built, including the famous Basilica Aemilia, first built in 179 B.C.E., and remodeled from c. 55 to 34 B.C.E. as the Basilica Paulli. Restored again after a fire in 14 B.C.E., the famous basilica was deemed by Pliny the Elder to be one of the three most beautiful monuments in Rome (Plin. <em>HN</em> <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/978/1/0#2619\">36.102.5</a>)</p>\n"

"<h3>Imperial period</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The advent of the principate of Augustus (27 B.C.E. &ndash; 14 C.E.) brought about additions and renovations to the Forum Romanum. With the deification of Julius Caesar, Augustus&rsquo; adoptive father, a temple dedicated to Caesar&rsquo;s cult (<em>templum&nbsp;divi Iulii</em>) was constructed on the edge of the forum square (15 in the diagram below).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus restored existing buildings, completed incomplete projects, and added commemorative projects to celebrate his own accomplishments and those of his family members. In this latter group, the Arch of Augustus (#16 above) and the Porticus of Caius and Lucius are notable. The former was a triumphal arch celebrating significant military and diplomatic accomplishments of the emperor, while the latter honored the emperor&rsquo;s grandsons. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus also followed Julius Caesar in creating yet another new forum space beyond the Forum Romanum that was named the Forum of Augustus.&nbsp;(dedicated in 2 B.C.E.). These new Imperial Fora in some cases provided additional space and, in turn, shifted attention away from the Forum Romanum.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Imperial period the Forum Romanum itself saw only sporadic new construction, although the maintenance of the existing structures would have provided a pressing and ongoing obligation. Just beyond the limit of the forum proper the second century C.E. temple of Antoninus Pius and his wife Faustina was constructed in 141 C.E. (and then modified in 161 C.E. following the emperor&rsquo;s death).&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Decline</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Declining imperial fortunes led inevitably to urban decay at Rome. After the Severan and Tetrarchic building programs of the third century C.E. and Constantinian investment in the early fourth century C.E., the forum and its environs began to decline and decay.&nbsp;Constantine I officially relocated the administrative center of the Roman world to Constantinople in 330 C.E. and Theodosius I suppressed all &quot;pagan&quot;&nbsp;religions and ordered temples shut permanently in 394 C.E. These changes, coupled with population decline, spelled the gradual demise of spaces like the Forum Romanum. Roman monuments were cannibalized for building materials and open, unused spaces were re-purposed&mdash;sometimes as ad hoc dwellings and other times for the deposition of rubbish and fill. Thus the forum slowly yielded its sacro-civic functions to more mundane concerns like pasturage&mdash;in fact it eventually came to be known as the &ldquo;Campo Vaccino&rdquo; (cow field).</p>\n"

"<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"View of the Roman Forum\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/67a0d85eaa60a2835ca2ec9c46dbdb23fb10e5ac.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">View of the Roman Forum</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The beauty of the ruins</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monument that is considered to be the final ancient structure erected in the Forum Romanum is a re-purposed monumental column set in place by the emperor Phocas in August of 608 C.E. The anonymous Einsiedeln itinerary, written in the eighth century C.E., mentions a general state of decay in the forum. A major earthquake in 847 C.E. wreaked considerable damage on remaining Roman monuments in the forum and in its environs. During the Middle Ages ancient structures provided reusable buildings materials, as well as reusable foundations, for Medieval structures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ruins themselves provided endless inspiration for artists, including painters the likes of Canaletto who became interested in the romanticism of the ruins of the ancient city as well as for cartographers and engravers the likes of G. B. Piranesi and G. Vasi, among others, who created views of the ruins themselves and restored plans of the ancient city.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Forum Romanum, despite being a relatively small space, was central to the function and identity of the city of Rome (and the wider Roman empire). The Forum Romanum played a key role in creating&nbsp;a communal focal point, one toward which various members of a diverse socio-economic community could gravitate. In that centralized space community rituals that served a larger purpose of group unity could be performed and observed and elites could reinforce social hierarchy through the display of monumental art and architecture. These devices that could create and continually reinforce not only a sense of community belonging but also the existing social hierarchy were of vital importance in archaic states. Even as the Forum Romanum changed over time, it remained an important space. After a series of emperors chose to build new forum complexes (the Imperial Fora)&nbsp;adjacent to the Forum Romanum, it retained its symbolic importance, especially considering that, as a people, ancient Romans were incredibly loyal to ancestral practices and traditions.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Rediscovery and excavation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of the monuments of the Forum Romanum, along with ancient occupation levels, gradually disappeared from view. Systematic exploration and study began under archaeologist Carlo Fea who started to clear the area near the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803. Study continued during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with prominent scholars including Rodolfo Lanciani, Giacomo Boni, Einar Gjerstad,&nbsp;and Andrea Carandini, among others, leading major campaigns. Study and excavation&mdash;as well as the hugely important obligation of preservation&mdash;continue in the Forum Romanum today. The bulk of the forum is accessible to visitors who have the opportunity to experience one of the great documents of urban archaeology.</p>\n"

In his summary, Plautus gives the reader the sense that one could find just about every sort of person in the forum&mdash;from criminals and hustlers to politicians and&nbsp;prostitutes. His summary reminds us that in the city of Rome the Forum Romanum was the key political, ritual, and civic center. Located in a valley separating the Capitoline and Palatine Hills, the Forum developed from the earliest times and remained in use after the city&rsquo;s eventual decline; during that span of time the forum witnessed the growth and eventual contraction of the city and her empire.&nbsp;The archaeological remains of the Forum Romanum&nbsp;itself continue to provide important insights into the phases and processes associated with urbanism and monumentality in ancient Rome.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The traditional foundation narrative holds that one of the first acts of Romulus, the city&rsquo;s eponymous founder, was to establish a fortification wall around the Palatine Hill, the site of his new settlement. The Capitoline Hill, opposite the Palatine, emerged as the city&rsquo;s citadel (<em>arx</em>) and site of the poliadic cult of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, among others (poliadic:&nbsp;the chief civic cult of an ancient city, derived from the Greek word &quot;polis&quot;).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Iron Age populations had used the marshy valley separating the Palatine and Capitoline hills as a necropolis (a large ancient cemetery), but the burgeoning settlement of archaic Rome had need of communal space and the valley was repurposed from a necropolis to a usable space. This required several transformations, both of human activity and the natural environment. Burial activity&nbsp;had to be transferred elsewhere;&nbsp;or this reason the main necropolis site shifted to the far side of the Esquiline Hill.<br />\n"

Since the Tiber river tended to leave its banks regularly, the valley was prone to significant flooding, as a low saddle of land known as the Velabrum connects the forum valley to the riverine zone. As coring studies conducted&nbsp;by Albert J. Ammerman have shown, a deliberate landfill project deposited fill in the forum valley in order to create usable, dry levels during the sixth century B.C.E. Twentieth century excavators, including Giacomo Boni and Einar Gjerstad, revealed important remains of Iron Age burials that pre-dated the establishment of the forum valley as a civic space; in particular the necropolis in the area known as the <em>Sepulcretum</em> along the Sacra Via (&quot;Sacred Way,&quot; the&nbsp;main sacred processional road of the city)&nbsp;has been extensively studied and published.&nbsp;The investigations of the burials themselves, and the patterns they followed, have allowed archaeologists to understand not only funeral customs but also social dynamics during Rome&rsquo;s proto-urban phases.<br />\n"

"<p>This major investment in the creation of civic space and the organization of labor also provides important information about the socio-economic structure of early Rome (Livy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi0011.perseus-eng3\">1.59.9</a>). The drainage canal eventually came to have a vaulted covering and was known as the <em>Cloaca Maxima</em> or &quot;Great Drain.&quot;&nbsp;One of the clear outcomes of these civic investments was the creation of a usable space that came to be a civic focus for activities in many spheres, especially political and sacred functions.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Temples and sacred buildings</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the Early Republican period the forum space saw the construction of key temples. One of the most prominent early temples is the Temple of Saturn (often considered the earliest of the temples in the Forum Romanum), the first iteration of which dates c. 498 B.C.E. The temple was dedicated to Saturn, the god of agriculture, and housed the state treasury. The temple was rebuilt in 42 B.C.E. and again after 283 C.E. Another early Republican temple is the Temple of the Castors (a.k.a. Temple of Castor and Pollux) that was completed in 484 B.C.E. and was dedicated to the Gemini who had aided the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 B.C.E. The temple had several construction phases. The Sacra Via&nbsp;passed along the forum square en route to the Capitoline Hill and the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. This sacred route was used for certain state-level ceremonies, especially the celebration of the victory ritual known as the Roman triumph.<br />\n"
"<br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Temple of Vesta\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8a44fb3981a08f0458e14bb1cf92414c195a9bcf.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Temple of Vesta</span></span>Two other early, sacred buildings are important to note. These are the Regia or &quot;king&rsquo;s house&quot;&nbsp;and the Temple of Vesta, both located on the downward slope of the Palatine Hill near the point where it reaches the edge of the Forum Romanum proper. Both of these sacred buildings are quite ancient and had many building phases, making it difficult to refine the chronology of the earliest phases. The Regia served as a ceremonial home for the king&mdash;later passing into the ownership of the pontifex maximus (principal state-level priesthood) once the kings had been expelled&mdash;and consisted of an irregularly planned suite of rooms surrounding a courtyard. The sixth century B.C.E. phase was decorated with painted plaques of architectural terracotta, clearly indicating both elite function and investment. Across the way was the Temple of Vesta, focused on the maternal elements of the archaic state as well as safeguarding the cult of Vesta and the sacred, eternal hearth flame of the Roman people. Both the Regia and the Temple of Vesta developed from crude structures in earlier phases to stone-built architecture in later phases. The Severan family carried out the final significant&nbsp;restoration of the Temple of Vesta in 191 C.E..</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Meeting spaces</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Important meeting spaces for political bodies emerged at the northwest side of the forum, namely a pair of complexes known as the Curia and Comitium. The Curia served as the council house for the Roman Senate, although the Senate could convene in any inaugurated space (i.e. a space ritually demarcated by Roman priests). The Curia emerged perhaps in the seventh century B.C.E., although little is known about its earliest phases. The surviving Curia is an imperial rebuilding of the Late Republican phase known as the Curia Julia, since Julius Caesar was its architectural patron. The Comitium was a tiered space that lay in front of the Curia that served as an open-air meeting space for public assemblies. Little of the Comitium remains today but it was a key architectural complex for political and sacred events during the time of the Roman Republic.&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>From Republic to Empire</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the fourth and third centuries B.C.E. the Forum Romanum certainly continued to develop, but material remains of large-scale architecture have proven elusive and thus our understanding of the space during those centuries is less clear than in other periods. One middle Republican development is the continued elaboration of the Rostra, the platform from which orators would speak to those assembled in the forum square. This monument would continue to develop over time and took its name from the prows (<em>rostra</em>) of defeated enemy warships that were mounted on its fa&ccedil;ade.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The later second and first centuries B.C.E., the Late Republican period, witnessed many changes in the city and in the Forum Romanum. The successes of Rome and her growing empire during the second and first centuries B.C.E. led to a great deal of monumental construction in the city, including in the Forum Romanum itself. It was during this Late Republican phase that Rome became a metropolitan center, equipped with the monumental architecture that could compete with&mdash;if not eclipse&mdash;that of the foreign powers Rome had tamed during the Punic Wars and those against the Hellenistic kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean. In particular the Romans established a&nbsp;tradition of constructing monuments commemorating famous men who had achieved great success in military and public careers. The first of these was the <em>Columna Rostrata</em> that marked the naval victory of Caius Duilius at the naval battle of Mylae in 260 B.C.E. The Roman interest in monumental, commemorative monuments, now referred to as triumphal arches, would soon follow.&nbsp;The first of these, the Fabian arch (<em>fornix Fabianus</em>), was dedicated on the Sacra Via toward the eastern end of the Forum Romanum in 121 B.C.E., commemorating the military victories (and family) of Quintus Fabius Allobrogicus (Cicero <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/474/28/0#4\">pro Planc. 17</a>). While the Fabian monument is no longer extant, its construction established a tradition&nbsp;(and a traditional form) for official commemorative and honorific monuments in the context of Roman public art.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Basilica</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The second century B.C.E. saw the creation and introduction of a unique Roman building type, the basilica. The basilica was a columnar hall that often had a multi-purpose use&mdash;from law courts to commerce to entertainments. Roman planners came to prefer them for lining the long sides of open squares, in a way not dissimilar from the Greek stoa. The sources claim that the Basilica Porcia (c. 184 B.C.E.) was the first basilica built at Rome, although no trace of it remains. The Basilica Porcia served as an office for the tribunes of the plebs. Other, more elaborate basilicae were soon to be built, including the famous Basilica Aemilia, first built in 179 B.C.E., and remodeled from c. 55 to 34 B.C.E. as the Basilica Paulli. Restored again after a fire in 14 B.C.E., the famous basilica was deemed by Pliny the Elder to be one of the three most beautiful monuments in Rome (Plin. <em>HN</em> <a href=\"http://latin.packhum.org/loc/978/1/0#2619\">36.102.5</a>)</p>\n"

"<h3>Imperial period</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The advent of the principate of Augustus (27 B.C.E. &ndash; 14 C.E.) brought about additions and renovations to the Forum Romanum. With the deification of Julius Caesar, Augustus&rsquo; adoptive father, a temple dedicated to Caesar&rsquo;s cult (<em>templum&nbsp;divi Iulii</em>) was constructed on the edge of the forum square (15 in the diagram below).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus restored existing buildings, completed incomplete projects, and added commemorative projects to celebrate his own accomplishments and those of his family members. In this latter group, the Arch of Augustus (#16 above) and the Porticus of Caius and Lucius are notable. The former was a triumphal arch celebrating significant military and diplomatic accomplishments of the emperor, while the latter honored the emperor&rsquo;s grandsons. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus also followed Julius Caesar in creating yet another new forum space beyond the Forum Romanum that was named the Forum of Augustus.&nbsp;(dedicated in 2 B.C.E.). These new Imperial Fora in some cases provided additional space and, in turn, shifted attention away from the Forum Romanum.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Imperial period the Forum Romanum itself saw only sporadic new construction, although the maintenance of the existing structures would have provided a pressing and ongoing obligation. Just beyond the limit of the forum proper the second century C.E. temple of Antoninus Pius and his wife Faustina was constructed in 141 C.E. (and then modified in 161 C.E. following the emperor&rsquo;s death).&nbsp;<br />\n"

The third century C.E. saw rebuilding of structures and monuments that had been damaged by fire, including the rebuilding of the Curia Julia by the emperor Diocletian in the late third century C.E. following a fire in 283 C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Decline</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Declining imperial fortunes led inevitably to urban decay at Rome. After the Severan and Tetrarchic building programs of the third century C.E. and Constantinian investment in the early fourth century C.E., the forum and its environs began to decline and decay.&nbsp;Constantine I officially relocated the administrative center of the Roman world to Constantinople in 330 C.E. and Theodosius I suppressed all &quot;pagan&quot;&nbsp;religions and ordered temples shut permanently in 394 C.E. These changes, coupled with population decline, spelled the gradual demise of spaces like the Forum Romanum. Roman monuments were cannibalized for building materials and open, unused spaces were re-purposed&mdash;sometimes as ad hoc dwellings and other times for the deposition of rubbish and fill. Thus the forum slowly yielded its sacro-civic functions to more mundane concerns like pasturage&mdash;in fact it eventually came to be known as the &ldquo;Campo Vaccino&rdquo; (cow field).</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The beauty of the ruins</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The monument that is considered to be the final ancient structure erected in the Forum Romanum is a re-purposed monumental column set in place by the emperor Phocas in August of 608 C.E. The anonymous Einsiedeln itinerary, written in the eighth century C.E., mentions a general state of decay in the forum. A major earthquake in 847 C.E. wreaked considerable damage on remaining Roman monuments in the forum and in its environs. During the Middle Ages ancient structures provided reusable buildings materials, as well as reusable foundations, for Medieval structures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The ruins themselves provided endless inspiration for artists, including painters the likes of Canaletto who became interested in the romanticism of the ruins of the ancient city as well as for cartographers and engravers the likes of G. B. Piranesi and G. Vasi, among others, who created views of the ruins themselves and restored plans of the ancient city.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Forum Romanum, despite being a relatively small space, was central to the function and identity of the city of Rome (and the wider Roman empire). The Forum Romanum played a key role in creating&nbsp;a communal focal point, one toward which various members of a diverse socio-economic community could gravitate. In that centralized space community rituals that served a larger purpose of group unity could be performed and observed and elites could reinforce social hierarchy through the display of monumental art and architecture. These devices that could create and continually reinforce not only a sense of community belonging but also the existing social hierarchy were of vital importance in archaic states. Even as the Forum Romanum changed over time, it remained an important space. After a series of emperors chose to build new forum complexes (the Imperial Fora)&nbsp;adjacent to the Forum Romanum, it retained its symbolic importance, especially considering that, as a people, ancient Romans were incredibly loyal to ancestral practices and traditions.<br />\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Rediscovery and excavation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Many of the monuments of the Forum Romanum, along with ancient occupation levels, gradually disappeared from view. Systematic exploration and study began under archaeologist Carlo Fea who started to clear the area near the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803. Study continued during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with prominent scholars including Rodolfo Lanciani, Giacomo Boni, Einar Gjerstad,&nbsp;and Andrea Carandini, among others, leading major campaigns. Study and excavation&mdash;as well as the hugely important obligation of preservation&mdash;continue in the Forum Romanum today. The bulk of the forum is accessible to visitors who have the opportunity to experience one of the great documents of urban archaeology.</p>\n"

"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> are located in an area bounded on the southwest by the Capitoline Hill, on the northeast by the Quirinal Hill, and extending toward the Esquiline Hill to the east. The <em>fora</em> were initially built between c. 54 B.C.E. and 113 C.E., with continuing additions, restorations, and modifications through late antiquity. In the middle ages the <em>fora</em> were spaces re-used for building materials, housing, industry, and burials. Gradually these spaces faded from view, buried beneath the medieval and modern city of Rome. A massive campaign of excavation in the twentieth century on the orders of the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini returned large areas of the <em>fora</em> to view. Ongoing archaeological investigation continues to reveal additional elements of the <em>fora</em> and to provide additional data that allow for their contextualization.</p>\n"

"<h3>Forum of Julius Caesar</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The Forum of Julius Caesar (also known as the<em> Forum Iulium</em> or <em>Forum Caesaris</em>) was the first of the imperial <em>fora </em>complexes to be built. Pompey the Great, a political rival of Caesar, had dedicated a monumental theater and portico complex in the Campus Martius in 55 B.C.E. and this perhaps spurred Caesar&rsquo;s ambition to construct a new forum complex. Caesar&rsquo;s project required the acquisition of land at the flank of the Capitoline Hill and he was aided in this early on by political allies, including Cicero, with the initial land purchased at a cost of sixty million sesterces (Cic. <em>ad Att</em>. 4.16.9).&nbsp;Additional land</span></p>\n"

The long sides of the forum square, flanking the temple, housed two storeys of rooms that may have served political and/or mercantile functions.

In this way, Augustus portrayed himself as the ideal man to lead the Roman state; he was&nbsp;connected to Rome&rsquo;s divine origins and he represented continuity with&nbsp;its republican tradition.

Pliny the Elder deemed the Forum of Augustus one of three most beautiful monuments in the city of Rome (Pliny the Elder <em>Natural History</em> 36.102.5).</p>\n"

"<h3>Templum Pacis / Forum of Vespasian</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The next imperial forum to be built was commissioned by the emperor Vespasian following the suppression of the Great Jewish Revolt that lasted from 66 to 73 C.E. Vespasian came to power following civil chaos in 69 C.E. and, together with his eldest son, Titus, suppressed the revolt and sacked the city of Jerusalem. During the summer of 71 C.E. Vespasian and Titus jointly celebrated a lavish triumph at Rome&mdash;an ancient ritual celebrating significant military victories. One of the key tenets of Vespasian&rsquo;s new administration was the restoration of the city, including the construction of new buildings and monuments. He dedicated a forum complex that housed a temple dedicated to Peace (<em>Pax</em>) in 71 C.E., completing it by 75 C.E. (Flavius Josephus <em>Jewish War</em> 7.5.7). This innovative complex was deemed one of Rome&rsquo;s most beautiful monuments by Pliny the Elder and housed not only significant spoils from Jerusalem but also masterworks of Greek art that had previously been hoarded by the emperor Nero.</p>\n"

Rather than featuring a central temple seated atop a prominent podium, the Templum Pacis complex consists of a square portico (dimensions 110 x 135 m) with the temple itself set within the eastern side of the portico, flanked by ancillary rooms. This left the square itself open for the installation of decorative water features and plantings which are seen both archaeologically and on fragments of the Severan marble plan of the city of Rome (<em>forma urbis Romae</em>) that was mounted in the forum complex in the third century C.E. The fragments of the Severan plan provide valuable information about the design of this architectural complex and has led scholars to speculate that&nbsp;the inspiration for its design may have been the great market (<em>macellum magnum</em>) of the city that had likely been destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. It is especially significant to note that this is a public space and that Vespasian&rsquo;s generosity granted the populace of Rome access not only to a beautiful, monumental square, but also to art&nbsp;and the spoils of military&nbsp;victory (including spoils from the Temple in Jerusalem).</p>\n"

"<p>The Forum Transitorium, also referred to as the Forum of Nerva, was begun by Domitian, the younger son of Vespasian. Incomplete at the time of Domitian&rsquo;s assassination in 96 C.E., the complex was completed by Nerva in 97 C.E. This is a narrow forum complex that abuts both the Forum of Augustus and the Templum Pacis and is constrained by these pre-existing structures (dimensions: 131 x 45 meters); as well as&nbsp;the Argiletum, a&nbsp;street that ran the length of the forum. The Forum Transitorium&rsquo;s temple was sacred to Minerva, who had been a patron divinity of Domitian, and the architectural sculpture that decorated&nbsp;the porticoes featured&nbsp;imagery connected to Minerva and scenes from the private lives of women.</p>\n"

"<p>The Forum of Trajan (<em>Forum Traiani</em>), the final imperial forum, was both the largest and the most lavish. Inaugurated in 112 C.E., the architectural complex relied upon imposing architectural and sculptural features to glorify the accomplishments and principate&nbsp;of the emperor Trajan. The elaborate forum complex has a vast footprint, measuring 200 x 120 meters. The open square of the forum is flanked by porticoes that contain exedrae and point viewer attention toward the main structure, the massive Basilica Ulpia. The architect Apollodorus of Damascus was responsible for the innovative design. On the western side of the basilica was another courtyard, flanked by two libraries (one Greek and one Latin), that contained a monumental honorific column, known today as the Column of Trajan.</p>\n"

(<em>Historia Augusta - Hadrian</em> 19.9). An ongoing point of scholarly contention is the position and appearance of this plan. Traditional reconstructions favor a free-standing temple at the western end of the forum, while more recent reconstructions instead favor a shrine positioned against the western exedra of the Forum of Augustus. Ongoing archaeological fieldwork may yet shed light on this contentious topographical debate.</p>\n"

"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> represent important architectural landscapes in the city of Rome. They demonstrate the efficacy of public art and architecture with respect to creating collective identity and communicating clear&nbsp;messages that both disseminate and reinforce ideology. The strength and accomplishments of the Roman state, not to mention its stability, are key&nbsp;themes in any such program of message making. We should also not underestimate the psychological effect of these grandiose, soaring, bedecked complexes,&nbsp;based around massive open plazas,&nbsp;on the minds and experiences of city dwellers (many of whom lived in crowded squalor). The Imperial <em>fora</em> demonstrate that within the mechanisms of Roman urbanism, civic architecture occupies a crucial role. We are reminded of this efficacy by an ancient example that is perhaps no different from the reaction of a modern visitor to the city of Rome. The emperor Constantius II, visiting Rome in the mid-fourth century C.E., was amazed by the Forum of Trajan, something he considered &ldquo;a construction unique under the heavens&rdquo; (Ammianus Marcellinus 16.10.15).</p>\n"

"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> are located in an area bounded on the southwest by the Capitoline Hill, on the northeast by the Quirinal Hill, and extending toward the Esquiline Hill to the east. The <em>fora</em> were initially built between c. 54 B.C.E. and 113 C.E., with continuing additions, restorations, and modifications through late antiquity. In the middle ages the <em>fora</em> were spaces re-used for building materials, housing, industry, and burials. Gradually these spaces faded from view, buried beneath the medieval and modern city of Rome. A massive campaign of excavation in the twentieth century on the orders of the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini returned large areas of the <em>fora</em> to view. Ongoing archaeological investigation continues to reveal additional elements of the <em>fora</em> and to provide additional data that allow for their contextualization.</p>\n"

"<p><span>The Forum of Julius Caesar (also known as the<em> Forum Iulium</em> or <em>Forum Caesaris</em>) was the first of the imperial <em>fora </em>complexes to be built. Pompey the Great, a political rival of Caesar, had dedicated a monumental theater and portico complex in the Campus Martius in 55 B.C.E. and this perhaps spurred Caesar&rsquo;s ambition to construct a new forum complex. Caesar&rsquo;s project required the acquisition of land at the flank of the Capitoline Hill and he was aided in this early on by political allies, including Cicero, with the initial land purchased at a cost of sixty million sesterces (Cic. <em>ad Att</em>. 4.16.9).&nbsp;Additional land</span></p>\n"

"The Forum of Caesar takes the form of a&nbsp;rectangle measuring 160 by 75 m. The centerpiece of the complex was the Temple of Venus Genetrix, dedicated to the goddess that Caesar celebrated as his distant ancestor. The octastyle (eight columns across the fa&ccedil;ade) temple was made of solid marble and sat&nbsp;atop a high podium. The long sides of the forum square, flanking the temple, housed two storeys of rooms that may have served political and/or mercantile functions.

The emperor Tiberius added two arches in 19 C.E. meant to honor the German victories of Drusus and Germanicus (Tacitus<em> Annales</em> 2.64; <em>CIL</em> 6.911) and the emperor Hadrian restored the forum complex in the second century. Pliny the Elder deemed the Forum of Augustus one of three most beautiful monuments in the city of Rome (Pliny the Elder <em>Natural History</em> 36.102.5).</p>\n"

"<h3>Templum Pacis / Forum of Vespasian</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The next imperial forum to be built was commissioned by the emperor Vespasian following the suppression of the Great Jewish Revolt that lasted from 66 to 73 C.E. Vespasian came to power following civil chaos in 69 C.E. and, together with his eldest son, Titus, suppressed the revolt and sacked the city of Jerusalem. During the summer of 71 C.E. Vespasian and Titus jointly celebrated a lavish triumph at Rome&mdash;an ancient ritual celebrating significant military victories. One of the key tenets of Vespasian&rsquo;s new administration was the restoration of the city, including the construction of new buildings and monuments. He dedicated a forum complex that housed a temple dedicated to Peace (<em>Pax</em>) in 71 C.E., completing it by 75 C.E. (Flavius Josephus <em>Jewish War</em> 7.5.7). This innovative complex was deemed one of Rome&rsquo;s most beautiful monuments by Pliny the Elder and housed not only significant spoils from Jerusalem but also masterworks of Greek art that had previously been hoarded by the emperor Nero.</p>\n"

Rather than featuring a central temple seated atop a prominent podium, the Templum Pacis complex consists of a square portico (dimensions 110 x 135 m) with the temple itself set within the eastern side of the portico, flanked by ancillary rooms. This left the square itself open for the installation of decorative water features and plantings which are seen both archaeologically and on fragments of the Severan marble plan of the city of Rome (<em>forma urbis Romae</em>) that was mounted in the forum complex in the third century C.E. The fragments of the Severan plan provide valuable information about the design of this architectural complex and has led scholars to speculate that&nbsp;the inspiration for its design may have been the great market (<em>macellum magnum</em>) of the city that had likely been destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. It is especially significant to note that this is a public space and that Vespasian&rsquo;s generosity granted the populace of Rome access not only to a beautiful, monumental square, but also to art&nbsp;and the spoils of military&nbsp;victory (including spoils from the Temple in Jerusalem).</p>\n"

"<h3>Forum Transitorium</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Forum Transitorium, also referred to as the Forum of Nerva, was begun by Domitian, the younger son of Vespasian. Incomplete at the time of Domitian&rsquo;s assassination in 96 C.E., the complex was completed by Nerva in 97 C.E. This is a narrow forum complex that abuts both the Forum of Augustus and the Templum Pacis and is constrained by these pre-existing structures (dimensions: 131 x 45 meters); as well as&nbsp;the Argiletum, a&nbsp;street that ran the length of the forum. The Forum Transitorium&rsquo;s temple was sacred to Minerva, who had been a patron divinity of Domitian, and the architectural sculpture that decorated&nbsp;the porticoes featured&nbsp;imagery connected to Minerva and scenes from the private lives of women.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Forum of Trajan (<em>Forum Traiani</em>), the final imperial forum, was both the largest and the most lavish. Inaugurated in 112 C.E., the architectural complex relied upon imposing architectural and sculptural features to glorify the accomplishments and principate&nbsp;of the emperor Trajan. The elaborate forum complex has a vast footprint, measuring 200 x 120 meters. The open square of the forum is flanked by porticoes that contain exedrae and point viewer attention toward the main structure, the massive Basilica Ulpia. The architect Apollodorus of Damascus was responsible for the innovative design. On the western side of the basilica was another courtyard, flanked by two libraries (one Greek and one Latin), that contained a monumental honorific column, known today as the Column of Trajan.</p>\n"

(<em>Historia Augusta - Hadrian</em> 19.9). An ongoing point of scholarly contention is the position and appearance of this plan. Traditional reconstructions favor a free-standing temple at the western end of the forum, while more recent reconstructions instead favor a shrine positioned against the western exedra of the Forum of Augustus. Ongoing archaeological fieldwork may yet shed light on this contentious topographical debate.</p>\n"

"<h3>Interpretation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Imperial <em>fora</em> represent important architectural landscapes in the city of Rome. They demonstrate the efficacy of public art and architecture with respect to creating collective identity and communicating clear&nbsp;messages that both disseminate and reinforce ideology. The strength and accomplishments of the Roman state, not to mention its stability, are key&nbsp;themes in any such program of message making. We should also not underestimate the psychological effect of these grandiose, soaring, bedecked complexes,&nbsp;based around massive open plazas,&nbsp;on the minds and experiences of city dwellers (many of whom lived in crowded squalor). The Imperial <em>fora</em> demonstrate that within the mechanisms of Roman urbanism, civic architecture occupies a crucial role. We are reminded of this efficacy by an ancient example that is perhaps no different from the reaction of a modern visitor to the city of Rome. The emperor Constantius II, visiting Rome in the mid-fourth century C.E., was amazed by the Forum of Trajan, something he considered &ldquo;a construction unique under the heavens&rdquo; (Ammianus Marcellinus 16.10.15).</p>\n"

"<h3>Overview</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The House of the Vettii or Casa dei Vettii (VI xv,1) is a Roman townhouse (<em>domus</em>) located within the ruined ancient city of Pompeii, Italy. A volcanic eruption destroyed Pompeii in the year 79 C.E., thus preserving extraordinary archaeological remains of the Roman town as it was at the time of its cataclysmic destruction. Those remains constitute a nearly unparalleled resource for the study of the Roman world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Domus</em> architecture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beginning with the Renaissance interest in all things classical, architectural historians and archaeologists have been debating the form and function of ancient Roman houses for several hundred years. The interest in the domestic architectural form was fueled further by the re-discovery, in the middle of the eighteenth century, of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and other sites destroyed by Vesuvius.&nbsp;<br />\n"

Brack</a>, 1995, posted by Penn State University, CC BY-NC 2.0)</span></span>A house is, of course, a dwelling&mdash;but it is also a stage on which the rituals of daily life and social hierarchy would be performed. During the time of the Roman republic (fifth through first centuries B.C.E.), ranking aristocratic families (patricians) used domestic display as a way to reinforce social position and as a way to advance their own fortunes, as well as those of their dependents and clients (<em>clientes</em>), within the community. Since Republican society operated on the basis of this patron-client relationship, the <em>domus</em> played a key part in the reinforcement of social hierarchy as the patron (<em>patronus</em>) would receive his clients (<em>clientes</em>) in the atrium of his <em>domus</em> each business day. While visiting with the patron, each client would get an eyeful of the patron&rsquo;s household wealth, thus applying implicit pressure on the patron to ensure that his house was tasteful and fashionable.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The patron-client system revolved around asymmetrical social relationships whereby lower ranking clients were bound to their patrons by the qualities of trust (<em>fides</em>) and dutifulness (<em>pietas</em>). Governed by ancestral custom (<em>mos maiorum</em>), clients would seek support and favors from the patron; in turn the patron provided protection, support, and benefaction, collectively known as <em>patrocinium</em>. This system had changed somewhat by the time of the brothers Vettii and it is unclear to what extent the patron-client system factored in their lives or in their own domestic sphere.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his treatise on Roman architecture, the first century B.C.E. author Vitruvius outlines the key elements, proportions, and aesthetics of the Roman house, creating what has been treated as a canonical recommendation for domestic architecture of the period. The Vitruvian canon (or standard) proposes a range of plans, suggesting strongly that the organization of interior space was important in Roman architectural theory (<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.3\"><em>De Architectura </em>6.3.3-6</a>). Although the plan of the Roman <em>domus</em> does reflect the canonical aspects described by Vitruvius, we also see enormous variation with modifications and remodeling undertaken over time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Standard plan of an ancient Roman Domus\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/49bc17b554edbc9d988b3e2484369b89e7f0b60e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Standard plan of an ancient Roman Domus</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The standard house (<em>domus</em>) plan has several key architectural elements. Generally entered from the street via a narrow doorway (<em>fauces</em>), the large centralized reception hall (<em>atrium</em>) is flanked by wings (<em>alae</em>) and often bounded by bedrooms (<em>cubicula</em>). The office of the head of household (<em>paterfamilias</em>), known as the tablinum, links the public part of the house (<em>pars urbana</em>) to the private part of the house (<em>pars rustica</em>). This latter area often focuses on an open, colonnaded courtyard (peristylium) and serves as the center of family life, with the kitchen (<em>culina</em>), dining room(s) (<em>triclinium</em> or <em>oecus</em>), and often a small garden (<em>hortus</em>). Many houses also had a second level that may have contained additional sleeping spaces and perhaps storage.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Excavation and Identification</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The House of the Vettii was excavated between late 1894 and early 1896. The artifacts that were recovered allowed for the identification of the house&rsquo;s putative owners, Aulus Vettius Conviva and his brother, Aulus Vettius Restitutus. Both men have been identified as former slaves or freedmen (liberti). The Vettii had risen to some prominence; Conviva was an&nbsp;augustalis&mdash;the top civic office for which a freedman would be eligible.&nbsp;In the construction and decoration of their house the brothers display&nbsp;a mind-set not uncommon among the newly-rich. Two strongboxes (arca -&nbsp;essentially lockable boxes for storing valuables)&mdash;concrete signs of wealth&mdash;were placed prominently in the large atrium so that visitors would be sure to notice them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Plan of Pompeii, with location of the House of the Vettii\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/533ceeeeade558b0b89034fab34fb7dd837ca252.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plan of Pompeii, with location of the House of the Vettii</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The strongboxes, paired with a painting of the god Priapus in the vestibule, serve to underscore the wealth of the brothers Vettii. This painting, which shows Priapus weighing his own phallus against a bag of money, may represent the socio-economic ambitions of the Vettii and perhaps indicates that those ambitions were different from those of high-ranking citizen families. This is interesting when we consider that achieving the status of <em>augustalis</em> likely indicates that Conviva made a large donation to a public works project in Pompeii.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The plan of the house</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The House of the Vettii covers an area of approximately 1,100 square meters. The construction of the house and its decorations belong to the final period of Pompeii&rsquo;s occupation and therefore provides important evidence of the aesthetics of the city on the eve of its destruction..</p>\n"

The plan of the House of the Vettii has two large central halls (<em>atria</em>) and, significantly, lacks an office space (<em>tablinum</em>). Entry to the house was gained from the east by way of a vestibule that granted admission to the larger atrium. The stone-lined basin for collecting rainwater (<em>impluvium</em>) lies at the center of the atrium. This larger atrium communicates directly with the peristyle (an open courtyard surrounded by fluted Doric columns) by means of a set of folding doors. The smaller atrium was the focus of the service portion of the house, while the peristyle and its well-appointed rooms was meant for entertainment and dining.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p><span>The decorative schema of the House of the Vettii provides important evidence for trends in domestic decoration in the final years of Pompeii&rsquo;s occupation. Since Pompeii suffered a major earthquake in 62 C.E. that caused significant destruction, the chronology of the wall paintings and other decorations in the House of the Vettii has been a topic of debate since the house&rsquo;s discovery.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Most art historians point to the house&rsquo;s decorative schema as being representative of a key transitional phase, between the Third and Fourth styles of Pompeian wall painting. Some scholars&nbsp;consider it among the finest examples of the Fourth Style at Pompeii. Paul Zanker sees the Fourth Style wall paintings as being imitations of higher art forms, reckoning that the chosen pictures aim to turn the rooms into picture galleries (<em>pinacothecae</em>).</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The atrium is richly decorated, as are the rooms opening onto the peristyle. Two of these were in the course of being painted at the time of destruction, while the other three are richly appointed with Fourth Style wall painting. The largest of these, a dining room, is decorated in panels of red and black with an exceptionally fine motif of erotes or putti (mythological winged gods associated with love) engaged in various occupations (image below). The central panel pictures that were likely set into the walls do not survive. Overall the scheme of wall painting in the house of the Vettii suggests an attempt at forward-looking&nbsp;interior decoration on the part of the owners.</span></p>\n"

"<p><span>Overall the evidence furnished by the House of the Vettii offers key insights into domestic architecture and interior decoration in the last days of the city of Pompeii.

"<p><span>The ancient city&nbsp;may be quiet now, its life ended by a fantastic cataclysm nearly two thousand years ago, but the remains of houses, decorations, and the objects of daily life whisper to us about the lives of the ancient people who inhabited Pompeii before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

"<h3>Visão geral</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The House of the Vettii or Casa dei Vettii (VI xv,1) is a Roman townhouse (<em>domus</em>) located within the ruined ancient city of Pompeii, Italy. A volcanic eruption destroyed Pompeii in the year 79 C.E., thus preserving extraordinary archaeological remains of the Roman town as it was at the time of its cataclysmic destruction. Those remains constitute a nearly unparalleled resource for the study of the Roman world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><em>Domus</em> architecture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Beginning with the Renaissance interest in all things classical, architectural historians and archaeologists have been debating the form and function of ancient Roman houses for several hundred years. The interest in the domestic architectural form was fueled further by the re-discovery, in the middle of the eighteenth century, of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and other sites destroyed by Vesuvius.&nbsp;<br />\n"

Brack</a>, 1995, posted by Penn State University, CC BY-NC 2.0)</span></span>A house is, of course, a dwelling&mdash;but it is also a stage on which the rituals of daily life and social hierarchy would be performed. During the time of the Roman republic (fifth through first centuries B.C.E.), ranking aristocratic families (patricians) used domestic display as a way to reinforce social position and as a way to advance their own fortunes, as well as those of their dependents and clients (<em>clientes</em>), within the community. Since Republican society operated on the basis of this patron-client relationship, the <em>domus</em> played a key part in the reinforcement of social hierarchy as the patron (<em>patronus</em>) would receive his clients (<em>clientes</em>) in the atrium of his <em>domus</em> each business day. While visiting with the patron, each client would get an eyeful of the patron&rsquo;s household wealth, thus applying implicit pressure on the patron to ensure that his house was tasteful and fashionable.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The patron-client system revolved around asymmetrical social relationships whereby lower ranking clients were bound to their patrons by the qualities of trust (<em>fides</em>) and dutifulness (<em>pietas</em>). Governed by ancestral custom (<em>mos maiorum</em>), clients would seek support and favors from the patron; in turn the patron provided protection, support, and benefaction, collectively known as <em>patrocinium</em>. This system had changed somewhat by the time of the brothers Vettii and it is unclear to what extent the patron-client system factored in their lives or in their own domestic sphere.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In his treatise on Roman architecture, the first century B.C.E. author Vitruvius outlines the key elements, proportions, and aesthetics of the Roman house, creating what has been treated as a canonical recommendation for domestic architecture of the period. The Vitruvian canon (or standard) proposes a range of plans, suggesting strongly that the organization of interior space was important in Roman architectural theory (<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.3\"><em>De Architectura </em>6.3.3-6</a>). Although the plan of the Roman <em>domus</em> does reflect the canonical aspects described by Vitruvius, we also see enormous variation with modifications and remodeling undertaken over time.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Standard plan of an ancient Roman Domus\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/49bc17b554edbc9d988b3e2484369b89e7f0b60e.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Standard plan of an ancient Roman Domus</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The standard house (<em>domus</em>) plan has several key architectural elements. Generally entered from the street via a narrow doorway (<em>fauces</em>), the large centralized reception hall (<em>atrium</em>) is flanked by wings (<em>alae</em>) and often bounded by bedrooms (<em>cubicula</em>). The office of the head of household (<em>paterfamilias</em>), known as the tablinum, links the public part of the house (<em>pars urbana</em>) to the private part of the house (<em>pars rustica</em>). This latter area often focuses on an open, colonnaded courtyard (peristylium) and serves as the center of family life, with the kitchen (<em>culina</em>), dining room(s) (<em>triclinium</em> or <em>oecus</em>), and often a small garden (<em>hortus</em>). Many houses also had a second level that may have contained additional sleeping spaces and perhaps storage.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Excavation and Identification</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The House of the Vettii was excavated between late 1894 and early 1896. The artifacts that were recovered allowed for the identification of the house&rsquo;s putative owners, Aulus Vettius Conviva and his brother, Aulus Vettius Restitutus. Both men have been identified as former slaves or freedmen (liberti). The Vettii had risen to some prominence; Conviva was an&nbsp;augustalis&mdash;the top civic office for which a freedman would be eligible.&nbsp;In the construction and decoration of their house the brothers display&nbsp;a mind-set not uncommon among the newly-rich. Two strongboxes (arca -&nbsp;essentially lockable boxes for storing valuables)&mdash;concrete signs of wealth&mdash;were placed prominently in the large atrium so that visitors would be sure to notice them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Plan of Pompeii, with location of the House of the Vettii\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/533ceeeeade558b0b89034fab34fb7dd837ca252.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plan of Pompeii, with location of the House of the Vettii</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The strongboxes, paired with a painting of the god Priapus in the vestibule, serve to underscore the wealth of the brothers Vettii. This painting, which shows Priapus weighing his own phallus against a bag of money, may represent the socio-economic ambitions of the Vettii and perhaps indicates that those ambitions were different from those of high-ranking citizen families. This is interesting when we consider that achieving the status of <em>augustalis</em> likely indicates that Conviva made a large donation to a public works project in Pompeii.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The plan of the house</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The House of the Vettii covers an area of approximately 1,100 square meters. The construction of the house and its decorations belong to the final period of Pompeii&rsquo;s occupation and therefore provides important evidence of the aesthetics of the city on the eve of its destruction..</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"View through the atrium to the peristyle\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f67fdcc665bf4fb339cd2a90dbe04cbb1609cc5b.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">View through&nbsp;atrium to the peristyle, photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/peterstewart/2431217760\">Peter Stewart</a>&nbsp;(CC BY-NC 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"

The plan of the House of the Vettii has two large central halls (<em>atria</em>) and, significantly, lacks an office space (<em>tablinum</em>). Entry to the house was gained from the east by way of a vestibule that granted admission to the larger atrium. The stone-lined basin for collecting rainwater (<em>impluvium</em>) lies at the center of the atrium. This larger atrium communicates directly with the peristyle (an open courtyard surrounded by fluted Doric columns) by means of a set of folding doors. The smaller atrium was the focus of the service portion of the house, while the peristyle and its well-appointed rooms was meant for entertainment and dining.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Wall paintings</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Frescoes in the atrium, House of the Vettii, Pompeii\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5ab4be8e9f801df9d7eb0a5b761f34499473d9da.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Frescoes in the atrium, House of the Vettii, Pompeii, photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nh53/5132243644/\">Irene Norman</a>,&nbsp;(CC BY-NC 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The decorative schema of the House of the Vettii provides important evidence for trends in domestic decoration in the final years of Pompeii&rsquo;s occupation. Since Pompeii suffered a major earthquake in 62 C.E. that caused significant destruction, the chronology of the wall paintings and other decorations in the House of the Vettii has been a topic of debate since the house&rsquo;s discovery.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Most art historians point to the house&rsquo;s decorative schema as being representative of a key transitional phase, between the Third and Fourth styles of Pompeian wall painting. Some scholars&nbsp;consider it among the finest examples of the Fourth Style at Pompeii. Paul Zanker sees the Fourth Style wall paintings as being imitations of higher art forms, reckoning that the chosen pictures aim to turn the rooms into picture galleries (<em>pinacothecae</em>).</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The atrium is richly decorated, as are the rooms opening onto the peristyle. Two of these were in the course of being painted at the time of destruction, while the other three are richly appointed with Fourth Style wall painting. The largest of these, a dining room, is decorated in panels of red and black with an exceptionally fine motif of erotes or putti (mythological winged gods associated with love) engaged in various occupations (image below). The central panel pictures that were likely set into the walls do not survive. Overall the scheme of wall painting in the house of the Vettii suggests an attempt at forward-looking&nbsp;interior decoration on the part of the owners.</span></p>\n"

"<h3>Siena: a&nbsp;city overlooked?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries, Siena&rsquo;s role in the history of European art was underappreciated. This is partly because its moment of greatest influence occurred just before the Renaissance, a period commonly associated with the nearby city of Florence (both Florence and Siena were independent city-states in Italy at this time&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.sheltonstate.edu/Uploads/files/faculty/Chuck%20Boening/western%20civ/Renaissance%20Italy.jpg\">see this map</a>). But history&mdash;even art history&mdash;is written by the victors. So when Siena&rsquo;s position of power faded while Florence remained one of the financial and artistic centers of Europe, the achievements of Sienese artists slid slowly into the background. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians now know that the development of style in these two city-states was closely intertwined. The artists of one inevitably influenced the other, even in later periods. It is not an exaggeration to say that, at the height of its artistic flourishing, Siena was unsurpassed in its fame for producing celebrated painters.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Siena Cathedral\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b237edd2e759bf9e1024086c0378de2f3d2a4976.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Siena Cathedral</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An international city</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the early fourteenth century, Siena was a wealthy and cosmopolitan city. Several large international banks were run by wealthy Sienese families. Merchants based in Siena traded goods in several foreign countries, particularly France. The city&rsquo;s location on the Via Francigena, the main pilgrimage route to Rome, meant that pilgrims from all over Europe streamed through its streets. These pilgrims would have been greeted by one of the most impressive cityscapes in Italy at the time. Spread out over three hills, the skyline was dominated by the enormous cathedral and by the central seat of government, the Palazzo Pubblico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. \n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e3e30f4c7f901c8865774bea7bdae8ad4a3aa9a4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Communal oversight of the arts&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many cities today, the Sienese were acutely aware of how art and architecture shaped the city&rsquo;s identity in the eyes of both natives and visitors. The communal government was controlled by the &ldquo;Nove,&rdquo; or the Nine, a rotating group of representatives chosen from the city&rsquo;s leading families. The Nove dominated art patronage during the period, helping to decide the layout of the city and its largest buildings, selecting committees to oversee large public projects, and subsidizing the decoration of churches.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sienese art of the period was communally oriented in a few other ways. The central government and various churches hired local Sienese artists, almost exclusively, to produce the most important paintings. Such a preference for native sons hints at a general pride in the city&rsquo;s painters, known throughout Italy for the quality of their work (this was not the case with sculpture). There were also a few examples of large works of art created for private individuals. Compare this to Florence at the time, where rich citizens often bought the right to decorate family chapels in large churches and where painters from other cities were sometimes awarded prestigious commissions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Duccio</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Duccio di Buoninsegna, The Rucellai Madonna, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence)  \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46b0b58a512e4a121a52252828059ed9db2d6299.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio di Buoninsegna,&nbsp;<em>Rucellai Madonna</em>, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>In fact, the most famous Sienese artist of the fourteenth century may have first made a name for himself in Florence. The earliest recorded work by Duccio, an artist who is often called the father of Sienese painting, was commissioned for the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This nearly fifteen-foot tall altarpiece depicting the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child introduced Duccio&rsquo;s innovative style to a wider audience. Like previous artists, Duccio was interested in creating beautiful patterns and shapes. We can see the love of surface decoration in the undulating arrangements of fabric or even in the faces of his figures. Yet he also used soft modeling with light and shade to give a sense of mass in the figures&rsquo; delicate but real bodies.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Duccio&rsquo;s ability to combine elegant lines and patterns with a fragile naturalism became a hallmark of Sienese painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Duccio, Maesta (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0994300bbf1aa960593705d69939bb15e6fd9a15.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio, <em>Maesta</em> (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell&#39;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Maest&agrave;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Santa Maria Novella altarpiece must have won Duccio fame in his own city of Siena, for he soon became a favorite painter of the commune. In 1308, he was asked to create a massive painting for the main altar in the middle of the Cathedral. The front of the altarpiece depicted the Madonna and Child sitting on a throne and surrounded by saints and angels, a subject known in Italian as a Maest&agrave;. Originally, the main scene was at the center of a set of stories and figures, all united in an elaborate wooden structure of frames covered in gold leaf. The back of the altarpiece was painted with a series of scenes from the life of Christ. Unfortunately, these panels are now dispersed in many museums. In these panels, Duccio demonstrated his unsurpassed skills of visual storytelling, capturing the imagination of contemporary viewers with his vivid depictions of the gospel stories that were so central to the faith of Siena and its visitors.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>Cathedral altarpieces&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is hard to overestimate how important Duccio&rsquo;s altarpiece was for the citizens who worshiped in front of it and for the artists who studied it. The city had long ago dedicated itself to the Virgin Mary, believing her to be their special protector. In an age where painted images gave faithful viewers a channel of access to celestial figures, the Maest&agrave; became the central representation of Siena&rsquo;s powerful patron as the queen of heaven.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work&rsquo;s role as a devotional and artistic well for the city was most eloquently honored in four altarpieces painted for the chapels surrounding Duccio&rsquo;s painting. Each altarpiece depicted a scene involving Mary, so that the story of her life would have unfolded as your eye travelled along the chapels. Over the course of two decades, one altarpiece was commissioned from each of the leading Sienese painters of the day, transforming the heart of the Cathedral into something like a gallery of the great Sienese artists. This is a perfect illustration of the city&rsquo;s tendency to blend devotional piety and civic pride in large artistic projects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" Simone Martini, The Annunciation, 1333, tempera on panel, 72 1/2 x 82 5/8&quot; or 184 x 210 cm.

(Uffizi, Florence) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Simone Martini</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the best known of these four altarpieces is the Annunciation by Simone Martini. Building on the legacy of Duccio, Simone was also influenced by the elongated, swaying figures and elaborate architectural forms of northern European art. On the other hand, his paintings show a bit more of the kind of careful observation of the world around him that we might associate with Giotto, the leading Florentine artist at the time. Thanks to this eclectic but refined mixing of new styles, Simone&rsquo;s reputation and influence spread throughout Europe, a legacy carried on by a large workshop of assistants and students.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Lorenzetti brothers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two of the other three artists hired to paint altarpieces behind the Maest&agrave; were actually brothers: Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. While the Lorenzetti brothers worked in the Sienese style, they absorbed the art of Giotto more fully than Simone Martini and his followers did. Weighty, massive figures covered in heavy drapery populate their works, a sure sign of their familiarity with Florentine painting.

"<h3>Siena: a&nbsp;city overlooked?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For centuries, Siena&rsquo;s role in the history of European art was underappreciated. This is partly because its moment of greatest influence occurred just before the Renaissance, a period commonly associated with the nearby city of Florence (both Florence and Siena were independent city-states in Italy at this time&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.sheltonstate.edu/Uploads/files/faculty/Chuck%20Boening/western%20civ/Renaissance%20Italy.jpg\">see this map</a>). But history&mdash;even art history&mdash;is written by the victors. So when Siena&rsquo;s position of power faded while Florence remained one of the financial and artistic centers of Europe, the achievements of Sienese artists slid slowly into the background. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Art historians now know that the development of style in these two city-states was closely intertwined. The artists of one inevitably influenced the other, even in later periods. It is not an exaggeration to say that, at the height of its artistic flourishing, Siena was unsurpassed in its fame for producing celebrated painters.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Siena Cathedral\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/b237edd2e759bf9e1024086c0378de2f3d2a4976.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Siena Cathedral</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>An international city</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>By the early fourteenth century, Siena was a wealthy and cosmopolitan city. Several large international banks were run by wealthy Sienese families. Merchants based in Siena traded goods in several foreign countries, particularly France. The city&rsquo;s location on the Via Francigena, the main pilgrimage route to Rome, meant that pilgrims from all over Europe streamed through its streets. These pilgrims would have been greeted by one of the most impressive cityscapes in Italy at the time. Spread out over three hills, the skyline was dominated by the enormous cathedral and by the central seat of government, the Palazzo Pubblico.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. \n"
"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/e3e30f4c7f901c8865774bea7bdae8ad4a3aa9a4.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. The representatives of the Sienese government, the &quot;Nine&quot; met here. </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Communal oversight of the arts&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Like many cities today, the Sienese were acutely aware of how art and architecture shaped the city&rsquo;s identity in the eyes of both natives and visitors. The communal government was controlled by the &ldquo;Nove,&rdquo; or the Nine, a rotating group of representatives chosen from the city&rsquo;s leading families. The Nove dominated art patronage during the period, helping to decide the layout of the city and its largest buildings, selecting committees to oversee large public projects, and subsidizing the decoration of churches.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Sienese art of the period was communally oriented in a few other ways. The central government and various churches hired local Sienese artists, almost exclusively, to produce the most important paintings. Such a preference for native sons hints at a general pride in the city&rsquo;s painters, known throughout Italy for the quality of their work (this was not the case with sculpture). There were also a few examples of large works of art created for private individuals. Compare this to Florence at the time, where rich citizens often bought the right to decorate family chapels in large churches and where painters from other cities were sometimes awarded prestigious commissions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Duccio</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Duccio di Buoninsegna, The Rucellai Madonna, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence)  \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/46b0b58a512e4a121a52252828059ed9db2d6299.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio di Buoninsegna,&nbsp;<em>Rucellai Madonna</em>, 1285-86, tempera on panel, 177 x 114&quot; or 450 x 290 cm (Uffizi, Florence) </span></span>In fact, the most famous Sienese artist of the fourteenth century may have first made a name for himself in Florence. The earliest recorded work by Duccio, an artist who is often called the father of Sienese painting, was commissioned for the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This nearly fifteen-foot tall altarpiece depicting the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child introduced Duccio&rsquo;s innovative style to a wider audience. Like previous artists, Duccio was interested in creating beautiful patterns and shapes. We can see the love of surface decoration in the undulating arrangements of fabric or even in the faces of his figures. Yet he also used soft modeling with light and shade to give a sense of mass in the figures&rsquo; delicate but real bodies.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Duccio&rsquo;s ability to combine elegant lines and patterns with a fragile naturalism became a hallmark of Sienese painting.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Duccio, Maesta (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/0994300bbf1aa960593705d69939bb15e6fd9a15.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio, <em>Maesta</em> (front, central panel), 1308-11 (Museo dell&#39;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Maest&agrave;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Santa Maria Novella altarpiece must have won Duccio fame in his own city of Siena, for he soon became a favorite painter of the commune. In 1308, he was asked to create a massive painting for the main altar in the middle of the Cathedral. The front of the altarpiece depicted the Madonna and Child sitting on a throne and surrounded by saints and angels, a subject known in Italian as a Maest&agrave;. Originally, the main scene was at the center of a set of stories and figures, all united in an elaborate wooden structure of frames covered in gold leaf. The back of the altarpiece was painted with a series of scenes from the life of Christ. Unfortunately, these panels are now dispersed in many museums. In these panels, Duccio demonstrated his unsurpassed skills of visual storytelling, capturing the imagination of contemporary viewers with his vivid depictions of the gospel stories that were so central to the faith of Siena and its visitors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Duccio, Maesta (reconstruction of back), 1308-11 (Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena)  \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/de9fbb61a91fcaa94122878011171960ef75e8ac.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Duccio, Maesta (reconstruction of back), 1308-11 (Museo dell&#39;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo, Siena) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Cathedral altarpieces&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is hard to overestimate how important Duccio&rsquo;s altarpiece was for the citizens who worshiped in front of it and for the artists who studied it. The city had long ago dedicated itself to the Virgin Mary, believing her to be their special protector. In an age where painted images gave faithful viewers a channel of access to celestial figures, the Maest&agrave; became the central representation of Siena&rsquo;s powerful patron as the queen of heaven.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The work&rsquo;s role as a devotional and artistic well for the city was most eloquently honored in four altarpieces painted for the chapels surrounding Duccio&rsquo;s painting. Each altarpiece depicted a scene involving Mary, so that the story of her life would have unfolded as your eye travelled along the chapels. Over the course of two decades, one altarpiece was commissioned from each of the leading Sienese painters of the day, transforming the heart of the Cathedral into something like a gallery of the great Sienese artists. This is a perfect illustration of the city&rsquo;s tendency to blend devotional piety and civic pride in large artistic projects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" Simone Martini, The Annunciation, 1333, tempera on panel, 72 1/2 x 82 5/8&quot; or 184 x 210 cm.

(Uffizi, Florence) </span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Simone Martini</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Perhaps the best known of these four altarpieces is the Annunciation by Simone Martini. Building on the legacy of Duccio, Simone was also influenced by the elongated, swaying figures and elaborate architectural forms of northern European art. On the other hand, his paintings show a bit more of the kind of careful observation of the world around him that we might associate with Giotto, the leading Florentine artist at the time. Thanks to this eclectic but refined mixing of new styles, Simone&rsquo;s reputation and influence spread throughout Europe, a legacy carried on by a large workshop of assistants and students.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Lorenzetti brothers</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Two of the other three artists hired to paint altarpieces behind the Maest&agrave; were actually brothers: Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. While the Lorenzetti brothers worked in the Sienese style, they absorbed the art of Giotto more fully than Simone Martini and his followers did. Weighty, massive figures covered in heavy drapery populate their works, a sure sign of their familiarity with Florentine painting. Even more than Giotto and his school, both Ambrogio and Pietro experimented with using different kinds of perspective to give an illusion of depth in the spaces their figures occupy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3d785182974044d37bee333c1a8e5fa8d88b2b8a.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"> Ambrogio Lorenzetti, detail from Allegory of Good Government, Effects of Good Government in the City and the Country, c. 1337-40, fresco, Sala della Pace (Hall of Peace) also known as the Sala dei Nove (the Hall of the Nine), 7.7 x 14.4 meters (room), Palazzo Pubblico, Siena</span></span></p>\n"

"<h3><span>Roman Art: When and Where</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman art is a very broad topic, spanning almost 1,000 years and three continents, from Europe into Africa and Asia. The first Roman art can be dated back to 509 B.C.E., with the legendary founding of the Roman Republic, and lasted until 330 C.E. (or much longer, if you include Byzantine art). Roman art also encompasses a broad spectrum of media including marble, painting, mosaic, gems, silver and bronze work, and terracottas, just to name a few.&nbsp;The city of Rome was a melting pot, and the Romans had no qualms about adapting artistic influences from the other Mediterranean cultures that surrounded and preceded them. For this reason it is common to see Greek, Etruscan and Egyptian influences throughout Roman art. This is not to say that all of Roman art is derivative, though, and one of the challenges for specialists is to define what is &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; about Roman art. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Doryphoros (Spear Bearer) or Canon. Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6'6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/06527f2a9dc5663aef7b38bf6f87dd7673b31758.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Doryphoros (Spear Bearer)</em>,&nbsp;Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6&#39;6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples),&nbsp;photo: Steven Zucker (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>Greek art certainly had a powerful influence on Roman practice; the Roman poet Horace famously said that &ldquo;Greece, the captive, took her savage victor captive,&rdquo; meaning that Rome (though it conquered Greece) adapted much of Greece&rsquo;s cultural and artistic heritage (as well as importing many of its most famous works). &nbsp;It is also true that many Romans commissioned versions of famous Greek works from earlier centuries; this is why we often have marble versions of lost Greek bronzes such as the <em>Doryphoros</em>&nbsp;by Polykleitos. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The Romans did not believe, as we do today, that to have a copy of an artwork was of any less value that to have the original. The copies, however, were more often variations rather than direct copies, and they had small changes made to them. The variations could be made with humor, taking the serious and somber element of Greek art and turning it on its head. So, for example, a famously gruesome Hellenistic sculpture of the satyr Marsyas being flayed was converted in a Roman dining room to a knife handle (currently in the National Archaeological Museum in Perugia). A knife was the very element that would have been used to flay the poor satyr, demonstrating not only the owner&rsquo;s knowledge of Greek mythology and important statuary,&nbsp;but also a dark sense of humor. From the direct reporting of the Greeks to the utilitarian and humorous luxury item of a Roman enthusiast, Marsyas made quite the journey. But the Roman artist was not simply copying. He was also adapting in a conscious and brilliant way.&nbsp;It is precisely this ability to adapt, convert, combine elements and add a touch of humor that makes Roman art Roman.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Republican Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mythic founding of the Roman Republic is supposed to have happened in 509 B.C.E., when the last Etruscan king, Tarquinius Superbus, was overthrown. &nbsp;During the Republican period, the Romans were governed by annually elected magistrates, the two consuls being the most important among them, and the Senate, which was the ruling body of the state. Eventually the system broke down and civil wars ensued between 100 and 42 B.C.E. The wars were finally brought to an end when Octavian (later called Augustus) defeated Mark Antony in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Marble bust of a man, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropilitan Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6607b0e560cc3dc3cce42932492accc2e348bc40.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Marble bust of a man</em>, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropolitan Museum of Art)</span></span>In the Republican period, art was produced in the service of the state, depicting public sacrifices or celebrating victorious military campaigns (like the Monument of Aemilius Paullus at Delphi). Portraiture extolled the communal goals of the Republic; hard work, age, wisdom, being a community leader and soldier. &nbsp;Patrons chose to have themselves represented with balding heads, large noses, and extra wrinkles, demonstrating that they had spent their lives working for the Republic as model citizens, flaunting their acquired wisdom with each furrow of the brow. We now call this portrait style veristic, referring to the hyper-naturalistic features that emphasize every flaw, creating portraits of individuals with personality and essence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Imperial Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus&rsquo;s rise to power in Rome signaled the end of the Roman Republic and the formation of Imperial rule. Roman art was now put to the service of aggrandizing the ruler and his family. It was also meant to indicate shifts in leadership. The major periods in Imperial Roman art are named after individual rulers or major dynasties, they are:&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Imperial art often hearkened back to the Classical art of the past. &nbsp;&ldquo;Classical&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Classicizing,&rdquo;&nbsp;when used in reference to Roman art refers broadly to the influences of Greek art from the Classical and Hellenistic periods (480-31 B.C.E.). Classicizing elements include the smooth lines, elegant drapery, idealized nude bodies, highly naturalistic forms and balanced proportions that the Greeks had perfected over centuries of practice.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus and the Julio-Claudian dynasty were particularly fond of adapting Classical elements into their art. The <em>Augustus of Primaporta </em>was made at the end of Augustus&rsquo;s life, yet he is represented as youthful, idealized and strikingly handsome like a young athlete; all hallmarks of Classical art. The emperor Hadrian was known as a philhellene, or lover of all things Greek. The emperor himself began sporting a Greek &ldquo;philosopher&rsquo;s beard&rdquo; in his official portraiture, unheard of before this time. D&eacute;cor at his rambling Villa at Tivoli included mosaic copies of famous Greek paintings, such as <em>Battle of the Centaurs</em> <em>and Wild Beasts</em> by the legendary ancient Greek painter&nbsp;Zeuxis. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Later Imperial art moved away from earlier Classical influences, and Severan art signals the shift to art of Late Antiquity. The characteristics of Late Antique art include frontality, stiffness of pose and drapery, deeply drilled lines, less naturalism, squat proportions and lack of individualism. Important figures are often slightly larger or are placed above the rest of the crowd to denote importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Roman art encompasses private art made for Roman homes as well as art in the public sphere.

They could also depict an emperor&rsquo;s successes in domestic and foreign policy rather than in war, such as Trajan&rsquo;s Arch in Benevento. Religious art is also included in this category, such as the cult statues placed in Roman temples that stood in for the deities they represented, like Venus or Jupiter. Gods and religions from other parts of the empire also made their way to Rome&rsquo;s capital&nbsp;including the Egyptian goddess Isis, the Persian god Mithras and ultimately Christianity.

"<h3><span>Roman Art: When and Where</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman art is a very broad topic, spanning almost 1,000 years and three continents, from Europe into Africa and Asia. The first Roman art can be dated back to 509 B.C.E., with the legendary founding of the Roman Republic, and lasted until 330 C.E. (or much longer, if you include Byzantine art). Roman art also encompasses a broad spectrum of media including marble, painting, mosaic, gems, silver and bronze work, and terracottas, just to name a few.&nbsp;The city of Rome was a melting pot, and the Romans had no qualms about adapting artistic influences from the other Mediterranean cultures that surrounded and preceded them. For this reason it is common to see Greek, Etruscan and Egyptian influences throughout Roman art. This is not to say that all of Roman art is derivative, though, and one of the challenges for specialists is to define what is &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; about Roman art. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Doryphoros (Spear Bearer) or Canon. Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6'6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples). \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/06527f2a9dc5663aef7b38bf6f87dd7673b31758.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Doryphoros (Spear Bearer)</em>,&nbsp;Roman copy after an original by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos from c. 450-440 B.C.E., marble, 6&#39;6&quot; (Archaeological Museum, Naples),&nbsp;photo: Steven Zucker (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>Greek art certainly had a powerful influence on Roman practice; the Roman poet Horace famously said that &ldquo;Greece, the captive, took her savage victor captive,&rdquo; meaning that Rome (though it conquered Greece) adapted much of Greece&rsquo;s cultural and artistic heritage (as well as importing many of its most famous works). &nbsp;It is also true that many Romans commissioned versions of famous Greek works from earlier centuries; this is why we often have marble versions of lost Greek bronzes such as the <em>Doryphoros</em>&nbsp;by Polykleitos. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>The Romans did not believe, as we do today, that to have a copy of an artwork was of any less value that to have the original. The copies, however, were more often variations rather than direct copies, and they had small changes made to them. The variations could be made with humor, taking the serious and somber element of Greek art and turning it on its head. So, for example, a famously gruesome Hellenistic sculpture of the satyr Marsyas being flayed was converted in a Roman dining room to a knife handle (currently in the National Archaeological Museum in Perugia). A knife was the very element that would have been used to flay the poor satyr, demonstrating not only the owner&rsquo;s knowledge of Greek mythology and important statuary,&nbsp;but also a dark sense of humor. From the direct reporting of the Greeks to the utilitarian and humorous luxury item of a Roman enthusiast, Marsyas made quite the journey. But the Roman artist was not simply copying. He was also adapting in a conscious and brilliant way.&nbsp;It is precisely this ability to adapt, convert, combine elements and add a touch of humor that makes Roman art Roman.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Republican Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The mythic founding of the Roman Republic is supposed to have happened in 509 B.C.E., when the last Etruscan king, Tarquinius Superbus, was overthrown. &nbsp;During the Republican period, the Romans were governed by annually elected magistrates, the two consuls being the most important among them, and the Senate, which was the ruling body of the state. Eventually the system broke down and civil wars ensued between 100 and 42 B.C.E. The wars were finally brought to an end when Octavian (later called Augustus) defeated Mark Antony in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C.E.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Marble bust of a man, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropilitan Museum of Art)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6607b0e560cc3dc3cce42932492accc2e348bc40.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Marble bust of a man</em>, mid 1st century, marble, 14 3/8 inches (The Metropolitan Museum of Art)</span></span>In the Republican period, art was produced in the service of the state, depicting public sacrifices or celebrating victorious military campaigns (like the Monument of Aemilius Paullus at Delphi). Portraiture extolled the communal goals of the Republic; hard work, age, wisdom, being a community leader and soldier. &nbsp;Patrons chose to have themselves represented with balding heads, large noses, and extra wrinkles, demonstrating that they had spent their lives working for the Republic as model citizens, flaunting their acquired wisdom with each furrow of the brow. We now call this portrait style veristic, referring to the hyper-naturalistic features that emphasize every flaw, creating portraits of individuals with personality and essence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Imperial Rome</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Augustus&rsquo;s rise to power in Rome signaled the end of the Roman Republic and the formation of Imperial rule. Roman art was now put to the service of aggrandizing the ruler and his family. It was also meant to indicate shifts in leadership. The major periods in Imperial Roman art are named after individual rulers or major dynasties, they are:&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Imperial art often hearkened back to the Classical art of the past. &nbsp;&ldquo;Classical&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Classicizing,&rdquo;&nbsp;when used in reference to Roman art refers broadly to the influences of Greek art from the Classical and Hellenistic periods (480-31 B.C.E.). Classicizing elements include the smooth lines, elegant drapery, idealized nude bodies, highly naturalistic forms and balanced proportions that the Greeks had perfected over centuries of practice.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Augustus and the Julio-Claudian dynasty were particularly fond of adapting Classical elements into their art. The <em>Augustus of Primaporta </em>was made at the end of Augustus&rsquo;s life, yet he is represented as youthful, idealized and strikingly handsome like a young athlete; all hallmarks of Classical art. The emperor Hadrian was known as a philhellene, or lover of all things Greek. The emperor himself began sporting a Greek &ldquo;philosopher&rsquo;s beard&rdquo; in his official portraiture, unheard of before this time. D&eacute;cor at his rambling Villa at Tivoli included mosaic copies of famous Greek paintings, such as <em>Battle of the Centaurs</em> <em>and Wild Beasts</em> by the legendary ancient Greek painter&nbsp;Zeuxis. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Later Imperial art moved away from earlier Classical influences, and Severan art signals the shift to art of Late Antiquity. The characteristics of Late Antique art include frontality, stiffness of pose and drapery, deeply drilled lines, less naturalism, squat proportions and lack of individualism. Important figures are often slightly larger or are placed above the rest of the crowd to denote importance.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>In relief panels from the <em>Arch of Septimius Severu</em>s from Lepcis Magna, Septimius Severus and his sons, Caracalla and Geta ride in a chariot, marking them out from an otherwise uniform sea of repeating figures, all wearing the same stylized and flat drapery. There is little variation or individualism in the figures and they are all stiff and carved with deep, full lines. There is an ease to reading the work; Septimius is centrally located, between his sons and slightly taller; all the other figures direct the viewer&rsquo;s eyes to him.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Easter Island is famous for its stone statues of human figures, known as <em>moai</em>&nbsp;(meaning &ldquo;statue&rdquo;). The island is known to its inhabitants as Rapa Nui.&nbsp;The <em>moai</em> were probably carved to commemorate important ancestors and were made from around 1000 C.E. until the second half of the seventeenth century.&nbsp;Over a few hundred years the inhabitants of this remote island quarried, carved and erected around 887 <em>moai</em>.&nbsp;The size and complexity of the moai increased over time, and it is believed that <em>Hoa Hakananai&#39;a</em>&nbsp;(below) dates to around 1200 C.E. It is one of only fourteen moai made from basalt, the rest are carved from the island&rsquo;s softer volcanic tuff.&nbsp;With the adoption of Christianity in the 1860s, the remaining standing <em>moai</em> were toppled.<br />\n"

Its eyes sockets were originally inlaid with red stone and coral and the sculpture was painted with red and white designs, which were washed off when it was rafted to the ship, to be taken to Europe in 1869.&nbsp;It was collected by the crew of the English ship HMS Topaze, under the command of Richard Ashmore Powell, on their visit to Easter Island in 1868 to carry out surveying work.&nbsp;Islanders helped the crew to move the statue, which has been estimated to weigh around four tons.

"<h3>The&nbsp;<em>moai</em> of&nbsp;Rapa Nui</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Easter Island is famous for its stone statues of human figures, known as <em>moai</em>&nbsp;(meaning &ldquo;statue&rdquo;). The island is known to its inhabitants as Rapa Nui.&nbsp;The <em>moai</em> were probably carved to commemorate important ancestors and were made from around 1000 C.E. until the second half of the seventeenth century.&nbsp;Over a few hundred years the inhabitants of this remote island quarried, carved and erected around 887 <em>moai</em>.&nbsp;The size and complexity of the moai increased over time, and it is believed that <em>Hoa Hakananai&#39;a</em>&nbsp;(below) dates to around 1200 C.E. It is one of only fourteen moai made from basalt, the rest are carved from the island&rsquo;s softer volcanic tuff.&nbsp;With the adoption of Christianity in the 1860s, the remaining standing <em>moai</em> were toppled.<br />\n"

"<h3>A rare night landscape</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The curving, swirling lines of hills, mountains, and sky, the brilliantly contrasting blues and yellows, the large, flame-like cypress trees, and the thickly layered brushstrokes of Vincent van Gogh&rsquo;s<em> The Starry Night</em> are engrained in the minds of many as an expression of the artist&rsquo;s turbulent state-of-mind. Van Gogh&rsquo;s canvas is indeed an exceptional work of art, not only in terms of its quality but also within the artist&rsquo;s oeuvre, since in comparison to favored subjects like irises, sunflowers, or wheat fields, night landscapes are rare. Nevertheless, it is surprising that <em>The Starry Night</em> has become so well known. Van Gogh mentioned it briefly in his letters as a simple &ldquo;study of night&rdquo; or &rdquo;night effect.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>His &nbsp;brother Theo, manager of a Parisian art gallery and a gifted connoisseur of contemporary art, was unimpressed, telling Vincent, &ldquo;I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight&hellip; but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things&rdquo; (813, 22 October 1889). Although Theo Van Gogh felt that the painting ultimately pushed style too far at the expense of true emotive substance, the work has become iconic of individualized expression in modern landscape painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/17735bb9ce7ba89b5fa2dc8eb2f19588069b7c83.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Vincent van Gogh, <em>Starry Night over the Rhone</em>,1888, oil on canvas, 72 x 92 cm (Mus&eacute;e d&#39;Orsay)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>Technical challenges&nbsp;</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Van Gogh had had the subject of a blue night sky dotted with yellow stars in mind for many months before he painted <em>The Starry Night</em> in late June or early July of 1889. It presented a few technical challenges he wished to confront&mdash;namely the use of contrasting color and the complications of painting en plein air (outdoors) at night&mdash;and he referenced it repeatedly in letters to family and friends as a promising if problematic theme. &ldquo;A starry sky, for example, well &ndash; it&rsquo;s a thing that I&rsquo;d like to try to do,&rdquo; Van Gogh confessed to the painter Emile Bernard in the spring of 1888, &ldquo;but how to arrive at that unless I decide to work at home and from the imagination?&rdquo; (596, 12 April 1888).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As an artist devoted to working whenever possible from prints and illustrations or outside in front of the landscape he was depicting, the idea of painting an invented scene from imagination troubled Van Gogh. When he did paint a first example of the full night sky in <em>Starry Night over the Rh&ocirc;ne</em> (1888, oil on canvas, 72.5 x 92 cm, Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay, Paris), an image of the French city of Arles at night, the work was completed outdoors with the help of gas lamplight, but evidence suggests that his second Starry Night was created largely if not exclusively in the studio. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Location</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Following the dramatic end to his short-lived collaboration with the painter Paul Gauguin in Arles in 1888 and the infamous breakdown during which he mutilated part of his own ear, Van Gogh was ultimately hospitalized at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, an asylum and clinic for the mentally ill near the village of Saint-R&eacute;my. During his convalescence there, Van Gogh was encouraged to paint, though he rarely ventured more than a few hundred yards from the asylum&rsquo;s walls.</p>\n"

"<h3>A rare night landscape</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The curving, swirling lines of hills, mountains, and sky, the brilliantly contrasting blues and yellows, the large, flame-like cypress trees, and the thickly layered brushstrokes of Vincent van Gogh&rsquo;s<em> The Starry Night</em> are engrained in the minds of many as an expression of the artist&rsquo;s turbulent state-of-mind. Van Gogh&rsquo;s canvas is indeed an exceptional work of art, not only in terms of its quality but also within the artist&rsquo;s oeuvre, since in comparison to favored subjects like irises, sunflowers, or wheat fields, night landscapes are rare. Nevertheless, it is surprising that <em>The Starry Night</em> has become so well known. Van Gogh mentioned it briefly in his letters as a simple &ldquo;study of night&rdquo; or &rdquo;night effect.&rdquo;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>His &nbsp;brother Theo, manager of a Parisian art gallery and a gifted connoisseur of contemporary art, was unimpressed, telling Vincent, &ldquo;I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight&hellip; but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things&rdquo; (813, 22 October 1889). Although Theo Van Gogh felt that the painting ultimately pushed style too far at the expense of true emotive substance, the work has become iconic of individualized expression in modern landscape painting.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"<h3><span>Technical challenges&nbsp;</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Van Gogh had had the subject of a blue night sky dotted with yellow stars in mind for many months before he painted <em>The Starry Night</em> in late June or early July of 1889. It presented a few technical challenges he wished to confront&mdash;namely the use of contrasting color and the complications of painting en plein air (outdoors) at night&mdash;and he referenced it repeatedly in letters to family and friends as a promising if problematic theme. &ldquo;A starry sky, for example, well &ndash; it&rsquo;s a thing that I&rsquo;d like to try to do,&rdquo; Van Gogh confessed to the painter Emile Bernard in the spring of 1888, &ldquo;but how to arrive at that unless I decide to work at home and from the imagination?&rdquo; (596, 12 April 1888).&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As an artist devoted to working whenever possible from prints and illustrations or outside in front of the landscape he was depicting, the idea of painting an invented scene from imagination troubled Van Gogh. When he did paint a first example of the full night sky in <em>Starry Night over the Rh&ocirc;ne</em> (1888, oil on canvas, 72.5 x 92 cm, Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay, Paris), an image of the French city of Arles at night, the work was completed outdoors with the help of gas lamplight, but evidence suggests that his second Starry Night was created largely if not exclusively in the studio. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Localização</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Following the dramatic end to his short-lived collaboration with the painter Paul Gauguin in Arles in 1888 and the infamous breakdown during which he mutilated part of his own ear, Van Gogh was ultimately hospitalized at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, an asylum and clinic for the mentally ill near the village of Saint-R&eacute;my. During his convalescence there, Van Gogh was encouraged to paint, though he rarely ventured more than a few hundred yards from the asylum&rsquo;s walls.</p>\n"

Wall reliefs are found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k with some frequency, most often representing animals, such as pairs of animals facing each other and human-like creatures.

"<p>The most remarkable art found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, however, are the installations of animal remains and among these the most striking are the bull bucrania. In many houses the main room was decorated with several plastered skulls of bulls set into the walls (most common on East or West walls) or platforms, the pointed horns thrust out into the communal space. Often the bucrania would be painted ochre red. In addition to these, the remains of other animals&rsquo; skulls, teeth, beaks, tusks or horns were set into the walls and platforms, plastered and painted. &nbsp;It would appear that the ancient residents of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were only interested in taking the pointy parts of the animals back to their homes!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How can we possibly understand this practice of interior decoration with the remains of animals? &nbsp;A clue might be in the types of creatures found and represented. Most of the animals represented in the art of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were not domesticated; wild animals dominate the art at the site. &nbsp;Interestingly, examination of bone refuse shows that the majority of the meat which was consumed was of wild animals, especially bulls. The excavator believes this selection in art and cuisine had to do with the contemporary era of increased domestication of animals and what is being celebrated are the animals which are part of the memory of the recent cultural past, when hunting was much more important for survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p><span>&Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k or &Ccedil;atal H&ouml;y&uuml;k&nbsp;(pronounced &quot;cha-tal hay OOK&quot;) is not the oldest site of the Neolithic era or the largest, but it is extremely important to the beginning of art. &nbsp;Located near the modern city of Konya in south central Turkey, it was inhabited 9000 years ago by up to 8000 people who lived together in a large town. &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, across its history, witnesses the transition from exclusively hunting and gathering subsistence to increasing skill in plant and animal domestication. We might see &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k as a site whose history is about one of man&rsquo;s most important transformations: from nomad to settler. &nbsp;It is also a site at which we see art, both painting and sculpture, appear to play a newly important role in the lives of settled people. &nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"<p><span>Like at Jericho, the deceased were placed under the floors or platforms in houses and sometimes the skulls were removed and plastered to resemble live faces. &nbsp;The burials at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k show no significant variations, either based on wealth or gender; the only bodies which were treated differently, decorated with beads and covered with ochre, were those of children. The excavator of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k believes that this special concern for youths at the site may be a reflection of the society becoming more sedentary and required larger numbers of children because of increased labor, exchange and inheritance needs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n"

"Nearly every house excavated at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k was found to contain decorations on its walls and platforms, most often in the main room of the house.

"<p>painting and the excavator of the site believes that geometric wall painting was particularly associated with adjacent buried youths. Figural paintings show the animal world alone, such as, for instance, two cranes facing each other standing behind a fox, or in interaction with people, such as a vulture pecking at a human corpse or hunting scenes. Wall reliefs are found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k with some frequency, most often representing animals, such as pairs of animals facing each other and human-like creatures. These latter reliefs, alternatively thought to be bears, goddesses or regular humans, are always represented splayed, with their heads, hands and feet removed, presumably at the time the house was abandoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The most remarkable art found at &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, however, are the installations of animal remains and among these the most striking are the bull bucrania. In many houses the main room was decorated with several plastered skulls of bulls set into the walls (most common on East or West walls) or platforms, the pointed horns thrust out into the communal space. &nbsp;Often the bucrania would be painted ochre red. In addition to these, the remains of other animas&rsquo; skulls, teeth, beaks, tusks or horns were set into the walls and platforms, plastered and painted. &nbsp;It would appear that the ancient residents of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were only interested in taking the pointy parts of the animals back to their homes!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>How can we possibly understand this practice of interior decoration with the remains of animals? &nbsp;A clue might be in the types of creatures found and represented. Most of the animals represented in the art of &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k were not domesticated; wild animals dominate the art at the site. &nbsp;Interestingly, examination of bone refuse shows that the majority of the meat which was consumed was of wild animals, especially bulls. The excavator believes this selection in art and cuisine had to do with the contemporary era of increased domestication of animals and what is being celebrated are the animals which are part of the memory of the recent cultural past, when hunting was much more important for survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h3>The Diaspora</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although there is no archaeological evidence for it, the Hebrew Bible describes a Temple in Jerusalem erected by King Solomon, probably sometime during the tenth century B.C.E. The Bible also describes the Temple&rsquo;s destruction at the hand of the Babylonians 500 years later.

Rabbinical scholars realized then that it would be necessary to write down oral interpretations&mdash;and they set the blueprint for future generations who would debate and reinterpret Jewish laws. The best-known rabbinical scholar was Hillel (70 B.C.E. to 10 C.E.). &nbsp;Hillel developed methods for interpreting the Hebrew Bible that were flexible. &nbsp;Since its inception, Judaism has been subject to community ritual interpretation and context.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A new Temple was constructed a century after the first was destroyed when some Jews returned to the Land of Israel.

"<h3>The Middle Ages&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Diaspora, Jewish groups lived in both Muslim- and Christian-dominated areas. Local communities had distinct traditions, but the differences between those who came from Muslim areas and those who came from Christian areas was more pronounced. Jews who can trace their ancestry&nbsp;back to Central and Eastern European areas are now known as Ashkenazim, and those who come from the Islamic world are now known as Sephardim. Sephardic Jews technically trace their origins back to the Iberian Peninsula, but Jews from the historically Muslim lands of the Middle East and North Africa (referred to as Mizrahi and Maghrebi, respectively), have been conflated with contemporary Sephardim since they share many of the same customs. These labels did not become widely used until the 1960s, when Jews from Islamic lands emigrated into Europe, the United States, and Israel. On a global scale, these distinctions weren&rsquo;t relevant until after World War II.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In both Ashkenazic and Sephardic communities, Jews in the Middle Ages had to pay taxes in exchange for communal autonomy.

"The back is blank except for an Arabic stamp with the name and date of the Muslim ruler, Imam al-Mansur al-Husayn, and an engraved inscription in Hebrew that names the silversmith, Yahya Tayyib&nbsp;</span></span>Life for Jews in Islamic lands was comparatively tranquil. In areas dominated by Muslims, Jews in the Middle Ages were tolerated as a &ldquo;dhimmi&rdquo;&mdash;a people of the book. Unlike in the Christian world, Jewish people were not the only non-Muslim inhabitants (there were also Christians, Zoroastrians,&nbsp;Hindus, Buddhists, etc.). Jews were integrated into the economy, and they were allowed to practice their religion freely. Jews conducted business with non-Jews in the Middle Ages and the similarities in art, music, and food traditions speak to Jewish and non-Jewish interaction. But their communal lives remained mostly separate&mdash;Jewish dietary laws, or kashrut, meant that Jews had their own butchers, bakers, and even wine producers. The weekly Sabbath meant that Jewish merchants and peasants would refrain from work, while Christian or Muslim commerce might continue. And&nbsp;Jewish law forbid marriage&nbsp;outside of the religion,&nbsp;further solidifying&nbsp;boundaries between Jews and their neighbors&mdash;boundaries that in some later instances became&nbsp;walled ghettos within which&nbsp;Jews were forced to live.</p>\n"

"The back is blank except for an Arabic stamp with the name and date of the Muslim ruler, Imam al-Mansur al-Husayn, and an engraved inscription in Hebrew that names the silversmith, Yahya Tayyib&nbsp;</span></span>Life for Jews in Islamic lands was comparatively tranquil. In areas dominated by Muslims, Jews in the Middle Ages were tolerated as a &ldquo;dhimmi&rdquo;&mdash;a people of the book. Unlike in the Christian world, Jewish people were not the only non-Muslim inhabitants (there were also Christians, Zoroastrians,&nbsp;Hindus, Buddhists, etc.). Jews were integrated into the economy, and they were allowed to practice their religion freely. Jews conducted business with non-Jews in the Middle Ages and the similarities in art, music, and food traditions speak to Jewish and non-Jewish interaction. But their communal lives remained mostly separate&mdash;Jewish dietary laws, or kashrut, meant that Jews had their own butchers, bakers, and even wine producers. The weekly Sabbath meant that Jewish merchants and peasants would refrain from work, while Christian or Muslim commerce might continue. And&nbsp;Jewish law forbid marriage&nbsp;outside of the religion,&nbsp;further solidifying&nbsp;boundaries between Jews and their neighbors&mdash;boundaries that in some later instances became&nbsp;walled ghettos within which&nbsp;Jews were forced to live.</p>\n"

"<h3>Eurasian connections</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Silla crown demonstrates cultural interactions between the Korean peninsula and the Eurasian steppe (thousands of miles&nbsp;of grassland&nbsp;that stretches&nbsp;from central Europe through Asia). Scytho-Siberian peoples of the Eurasian steppe created golden diadems similar to the Silla crown, such as a crown from Tillya Tepe&nbsp;(an archaeological site of six nomad graves that contained objects known as the &ldquo;Bactrian Hoard&rdquo;)&nbsp;&nbsp;in modern-day Afghanistan. With five tree-shaped projections, flower ornaments and reflective discs, the Tillya Tepe crown can be compared with the natural imagery and radiant gold of the Silla crown. Though separated by many miles and by centuries, both crowns attest to shamanic beliefs prevalent among the nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppe.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Burial customs in the Three Kingdoms Period</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Though their use of gold and practice of shamanism related to the northern steppe cultures, the Silla royalty adopted the burial customs of the Chinese by burying their elite in mounded tombs. In Chinese burials, objects that were important in life were often taken to the grave. Similarly, power objects like the Silla gold crowns were used both above ground and below, and their luxurious materials conveyed the social status of the tomb occupant in the afterlife.&nbsp;</p>\n"

This gold belt, for instance, was made for the burial of a Silla king. It was like a tool belt or charm bracelet, with pendants that dangled from its band of interlinked square plates and entwining dragon openwork. Some objects were practical, such as knife sheaths and needle boxes, which evoked nomadic life on the Eurasian steppe. Others were symbolic, such as the comma-shaped ornaments seen on the Silla crown or miniature fish, which may have been charms to avert evil. The materials of the belt also corresponded to social status; for example, tombs of the Silla royalty had gold belts, while the nobility in other regions of the peninsula had silver or gilt-bronze belts.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Korea and the Silk Road</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Stretching from the Mediterranean to the Silla kingdom at the tip of the Korean peninsula, the Silk Road connected a vast terrain of ancient cultures. While the Silla kingdom shared shamanism with the Eurasian steppe and burial customs with China and Japan, the Silk Road was a main route for conveying materials, techniques, and ideas from as far away as Rome. Luxury objects in tombs of the Silla elite, such as these earrings, are made of gold and decorated with stylized foliage that resembles the Silla crown. Two tiers of leaf-shaped ornaments dangle from double loops adorned with floral motifs, continuing the imagery of the sacred world tree.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>However, a closer look at the thick, upper loop of each earring reveals the technique of granulation. Metalworking techniques, such as granulation (a&nbsp;technique whereby a surface is covered in spherules or granules of precious metal)&nbsp;and filigree&mdash;seen in the Mediterranean&mdash;appear to have traveled along the Silk Road. Silla tombs also contained other objects, such as Roman glass bowls and ewers, which reveal the extent to which luxury materials traveled via the Silk Road. These prized imports clearly inspired new forms of Korean-made luxury goods for use in both life and death.</p>\n"

A feast to the eye, the object is filled with drawings and paintings that were meant to show scribes and illuminators how to decorate letters, paint initials, or add large segments of decoration to the page. Within this tradition, two types of model books can roughly be distinguished. Some functioned as instruction manuals. In these books, the drawings might be accompanied by a narrative or explanation that instructs the artisan how to proceed, usually in a step-by-step process. Other model books appear to have merely functioned as a source of inspiration: they present a wide array of shapes and drawings from which the artisan could take his pick.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The level of sophistication among surviving model books varies considerably. On the lower end of the spectrum there are pattern books that merely show how to make enlarged letters with some minor flourishing. On the higher end, by contrast, there are copies with high-quality stand-alone designs and sophisticated historiated initials inhabited by figures and scenes. Evidently the requirements of the artisans varied; and by proxy, so did the taste of medieval readers. It is this variation that makes model books so fascinating, both as physical objects and as cultural artifacts.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>To start at the lower end of the spectrum, some model books merely showed scribes how to execute a certain script or how to draw plain enlarged capitals&mdash;the most basic kind of decoration. The book opening seen above&nbsp;is from Gregorius Bock&rsquo;s Scribal Pattern Book, which provides instruction on both fronts (<a href=\"http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3593605\">more about the manuscript here</a>). Produced in 1510-1517, the first part of the small parchment book contains a series of alphabets in different scripts, some of which are clearly influenced by print typefaces. The second part contains decorative initials arranged in alphabetical order. In the introduction to his manual, Gregorius adds a dedication to his cousin Heinrich Lercher Wyss of Stuttgart, who was scribe to the Duke of W&uuml;rttemberg. The arrangement of the material shows how Heinrich likely used the book: he would thumb through its pages until he had reached either an alphabet or capital letter to his liking.</p>\n"

This appears to be the oldest surviving pattern book for initials: it dates from c. 1150 and was produced and used in a Tuscan workshop. The choice is much more limited than in the previous example: the Cambridge copy does not provide multiple alphabets, nor does it present a wide range of initials (in fact, only about twenty are present). Interestingly, some manuscripts survive in which we encounter decorated letters that could well be modeled from this or a similar model book (like <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=6386&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=7183\">British Library, Harley MS 7183</a>).</p>\n"

A feast to the eye, the object is filled with drawings and paintings that were meant to show scribes and illuminators how to decorate letters, paint initials, or add large segments of decoration to the page. Within this tradition, two types of model books can roughly be distinguished. Some functioned as instruction manuals. In these books, the drawings might be accompanied by a narrative or explanation that instructs the artisan how to proceed, usually in a step-by-step process. Other model books appear to have merely functioned as a source of inspiration: they present a wide array of shapes and drawings from which the artisan could take his pick.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The level of sophistication among surviving model books varies considerably. On the lower end of the spectrum there are pattern books that merely show how to make enlarged letters with some minor flourishing. On the higher end, by contrast, there are copies with high-quality stand-alone designs and sophisticated historiated initials inhabited by figures and scenes. Evidently the requirements of the artisans varied; and by proxy, so did the taste of medieval readers. It is this variation that makes model books so fascinating, both as physical objects and as cultural artifacts.&nbsp;</p>\n"

It is this pillar that was adopted as the national emblem of India. It is depicted on the one rupee note and the two rupee coin.</p>\n"

"<p>The top of the column&mdash;the capital&mdash;has three parts.&nbsp;First, a base of a lotus flower, the most ubiquitous symbol of Buddhism.</p>\n"

"<p>Then, a drum on which four animals are carved representing the four cardinal directions: a horse (west), an ox (east), an elephant (south), and a lion (north). They also represent the four rivers that leave Lake Anavatapta and enter the world as the four major rivers. Each of the animals can also be identified by each of the four perils of samsara.

Their mouths are open roaring or spreading the dharma, the Four Noble Truths, across the land. The lion references the Buddha, formerly Shakyamuni, a member of the Shakya (lion) clan. The lion is also a symbol of royalty and leadership and may also represent the Buddhist king Ashoka who ordered these columns. A cakra was originally mounted above the lions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some of the lion capitals that survive have a row of geese carved below the lions. The goose is an ancient Vedic symbol (Veda means knowledge in Sanskrit and the Vedas refers to the canonical collection of hymns, prayers and liturgical formulas that make up the earliest of the Hindu sacred writings.

"\n"
"<h3>Site of Buddha&rsquo;s First Sermon</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most celebrated of the Ashokan pillars is the one erected at Sarnath, the site of Buddha&rsquo;s First Sermon where he shared the Four Noble Truths (the dharma or the law). Currently, the pillar remains where it was originally sunk into the ground, but the capital is now on display at the Sarnath Museum. It is this pillar that was adopted as the national emblem of India. It is depicted on the one rupee note and the two rupee coin.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Pillar</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The pillar is a symbol of the axis mundi (cosmic axis) and of the column that rises everyday at noon from the legendary Lake Anavatapta (the lake at the center of the universe according to Buddhist cosmology) to touch the sun.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The Capital&nbsp;</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The top of the column&mdash;the capital&mdash;has three parts.&nbsp;First, a base of a lotus flower, the most ubiquitous symbol of Buddhism.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Then, a drum on which four animals are carved representing the four cardinal directions: a horse (west), an ox (east), an elephant (south), and a lion (north). They also represent the four rivers that leave Lake Anavatapta and enter the world as the four major rivers. Each of the animals can also be identified by each of the four perils of samsara. The moving animals follow one another endlessly turning the wheel of existence.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/06d13a3b61041ce3c0c8a4a55173c00144ef1d37.jpg\" /></span>Four lions stand atop the drum, each facing in the four cardinal directions. Their mouths are open roaring or spreading the dharma, the Four Noble Truths, across the land. The lion references the Buddha, formerly Shakyamuni, a member of the Shakya (lion) clan. The lion is also a symbol of royalty and leadership and may also represent the Buddhist king Ashoka who ordered these columns. A cakra was originally mounted above the lions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Some of the lion capitals that survive have a row of geese carved below the lions. The goose is an ancient Vedic symbol (Veda means knowledge in Sanskrit and the Vedas refers to the canonical collection of hymns, prayers and liturgical formulas that make up the earliest of the Hindu sacred writings. Many of the Buddhist symbols and practices derive from these early texts). The flight of the goose is thought of as a link between the earthly and heavenly spheres.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>A vivid&nbsp;picture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When the British tried to expand their own trade in&nbsp;the 19th century, the Benin people killed their envoys. So in 1897 the&nbsp;British sent an armed expedition which captured the king of Benin,&nbsp;destroyed his palace and took away large quantities of sculpture and&nbsp;regalia, including works in wood, ivory and especially brass. Some of these things came from royal altars for the king&rsquo;s ancestors, but&nbsp;among them were a large number of cast brass plaques made to decorate&nbsp;the wooden pillars of the palace. These had been left in the palace&nbsp;storerooms while part of the palace was being rebuilt. As it later emerged,&nbsp;most of them were probably made between about 1550 -&nbsp;1650, the people&nbsp;and scenes that they show are so many and varied that they give a vivid&nbsp;picture of the court and kingdom of that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaques were most sought after and were bought by museums across Europe and America&mdash;you can see the plaques at the British Museum, in Chicago, Vienna, Paris and a large collection can be viewed in Berlin.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>A sensation</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The arrival and the reception of the bronze plaques caused a sensation in Europe. Scholars struggled to understand how African craftsmen could have made such works of art, putting forward some wild theories to explain them. Quickly, however, research showed that the Benin bronzes were entirely West African creations without European influence, and they transformed&nbsp;European understanding of African history.</p>\n"

"<h3>The plaques</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When the son of the deposed king revived the Benin&nbsp;monarchy in 1914, now under British rule, he did his best to restore the&nbsp;palace and continue the ancient traditions of the Benin monarchy. Because&nbsp;these traditions are followed in the modern city of Benin, it is still possible&nbsp;to recognize many of the scenes cast in brass by Benin artists about five&nbsp;hundred years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As decorations for the halls of the king&rsquo;s palace, the plaques were designed to proclaim and glorify the prestige of the king, his status and&nbsp;achievements, so they give an informative but very one-sided view of the&nbsp;kingdom of Benin. They do not show how the ordinary people lived in the&nbsp;villages outside the city as farmers, growing their yams and vegetables in&nbsp;gardens cleared from the tropical forest. Nor do they show how most of&nbsp;the townspeople lived, employed in crafts such as the making of the brass&nbsp;plaques themselves. And most striking of all, there are no women or&nbsp;children shown in the plaques, which means that more than half of the&nbsp;people of the king&rsquo;s court are not shown.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Many of the brass plaques from the king&rsquo;s palace show images of&nbsp;</span><span>Portuguese men and they seem to have been made during the 16th and&nbsp;</span><span>17th centuries as their costumes show. Although Benin had no gold to&nbsp;</span><span>offer, they supplied the Portuguese with pepper, ivory, leopard skins and&nbsp;</span><span>people, who were taken as slaves to work elsewhere in Africa and in the&nbsp;</span><span>Portuguese colonies in Brazil.

"<p>When I decided to learn how to program, I looked for programs where ever I could find them.

I then moved into learning front end development, which I learned primarily through <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/\">Skillcrush</a>. It was tough to stay motivated from time to time, but I was very lucky to have friends in the industry who were able to help me when I got stuck and point me towards next steps when I wasn&rsquo;t sure where to go.</p>\n"

"<h3><span>A sacred object out of context</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The art of medieval India, like the art of medieval Europe, was primarily in the service of religion. The devotee&rsquo;s spiritual experience was enhanced by meditation inspired by works of art and architecture. Just as the luminous upper chapel of the Sainte Chapelle dazzled and overwhelmed worshipers in France, the looming bronze statues of Shiva and Parvati in, for example, the inner halls of the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, in south India would have awed a Hindu devotee.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Its important to keep in mind that the bronze <em>Shiva as Lord of the Dance</em> (&ldquo;Nataraja&rdquo;&mdash;nata meaning dance or performance, and raja meaning king or lord), is a sacred object that has been taken out of its original context&mdash;in fact, we don&#39;t even know where this particular sculpture was originally venerated. In the intimate spaces of the Florence and Herbert Irving South Asian Galleries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> is surrounded by other metal statues of Hindu gods including the Lords Vishnu, Parvati, and Hanuman. It is easy to become absorbed in the dark quiet of these galleries with its remarkable collection of divine figures, but it is important to remember that this particular statue was intended to be movable, which explains its moderate size and sizeable circular base, ideal for lifting and hoisting onto a shoulder.</p>\n"

"<h3>Made for mobility</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>From the 11th century and onwards, Hindu devotees carried these statues in processional parades as priests followed chanting prayers and bestowing blessings on people gathered for this purpose. Sometimes the statues would be adorned in resplendent red and green clothes and gold jewelry to denote the glorious human form of the gods. In these processions The <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> may have had its legs wrapped with a white and red cloth, adorned with flowers, and surrounded by candles. In a religious Hindu context, the statue is the literal embodiment of the divine. When the worshiper comes before the statue and begins to pray, faith activates the divine energy inherent in the statue, and at that moment, Shiva is present.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><span>A bronze Shiva</span></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Shiva constitutes a part of a powerful triad of divine energy within the cosmos of the Hindu religion. There is Brahma, the benevolent creator of the universe; there is Vishnu, the sagacious preserver; then there is Shiva, the destroyer. &ldquo;Destroyer&rdquo; in this sense is not an entirely negative force, but one that is expansive in its impact. In Hindu religious philosophy all things must come to a natural end so they can begin anew, and Shiva is the agent that brings about this end so that a new cycle can begin.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Metropolitan Museum&#39;s <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> was made some time in the eleventh century during the Chola Dynasty (9th-13th centuries C.E.) in south India, in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu. One of the longest lasting empires of south India, the Chola Dynasty heralded a golden age of exploration, trade, and artistic development. A great area innovation within the arts of the Chola period was in the field of metalwork, particularly in bronze sculpture. The expanse of the Chola empire stretched south-east towards Sri Lanka and gave the kingdom access to vast copper reserves that enabled the proliferation of bronze work by skilled artisans.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During this period a new kind of sculpture is made, one that combines the expressive qualities of stone temple carvings with the rich iconography possible in bronze casting. This image of Shiva is taken from the ancient Indian manual of visual depiction, the <em>Shilpa Shastras</em> (The Science or Rules of Sculpture), which contained a precise set of measurements and shapes for the limbs and proportions of the divine figure. Arms were to be long like stalks of bamboo, faces round like the moon, and eyes shaped like almonds or the leaves of a lotus. The <em>Shastras </em>were a primer on the ideals of beauty and physical perfection within ancient Hindu ideology.</p>\n"

"<h3>Beyond grace there is perfection</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The supple and expressive quality of the dancing Shiva is one of the touchstones of South Asian, and indeed, world sculpture. When the French sculptor Auguste Rodin saw some photographs of the 11th century bronze <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> in the Madras Museum around 1915, he wrote that it seemed to him the &ldquo;perfect expression of rhythmic movement in the world.&rdquo; In an essay he wrote that was published in 1921 he wrote that the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em> has &ldquo;what many people cannot see&mdash;the unknown depths, the core of life. There is grace in elegance, but beyond grace there is perfection.&rdquo; The English philosopher Aldous Huxley said in an interview in 1961 that the Hindu image of god as a dancer is unlike anything he had seen in Western art. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything that approaches the symbolism of this work of art, which is both cosmic and psychological.&quot;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The eloquent bronze statue of the <em>Shiva Nataraja</em>, despite the impact of its formal beauty on Rodin who knew little of its background, is incomplete without an understanding of its symbolism and religious significance. Bronzes of the Chola period such as <em>Shiva as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja)</em> arose out of a need to transmute the divine into a physical embodiment of beauty.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>You should definitely consider your study preferences, SAT goals, and resources before deciding on a study plan. In general, we recommend starting your SAT prep early; about three months before your test should give you enough of a buffer to try a few <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"9f945ba3-c712-4a34-8a5b-dbebe0556f94\" id=\"2a4b6723-2a53-4ed8-8e45-aaa63333d628\">study</gs> approaches and get comfortable with the content on the test.</p>\n"

"<p>For more tips on how to study and manage your time, see these ideas from fellow students.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><u><strong>What we recommend for everyone preparing for the SAT:</strong></u></p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Diagnose your skills early on. </strong>Even if you don&rsquo;t plan on starting your studying several months before the SAT, we advise you to take a diagnostic on Khan Academy (or complete the PSAT/NMSQT) six months before the test so you&rsquo;ll have a good sense of how close you are to your SAT goal. If you have a lot of skills to learn, you might want to start studying even earlier than you&rsquo;d planned. <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"5fd84f60-77f5-49ea-ac15-71b879ef5e68\" id=\"3beb3d90-b79c-49b0-8b2a-0f81e4513071\">Fariha</gs> suggests:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Figure out what areas you need to focus on the most, and keep practicing. Don&#39;t get discouraged if at first it is difficult to understand or learn, the more you practice the easier it will get.&rdquo;</em></li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Take at least two full practice tests.</strong> We recommend taking at least one toward the beginning of your studying, and one toward the end. We also recommend you take at least one practice test on paper, which is how the actual SAT is administered, so you can get comfortable with the format. Taking a full length practice test provides a realistic sense of how long the test is and where you tend to get tired or mentally blocked.

"<p><u><strong>What we recommend for everyone preparing for the SAT:</strong></u></p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Diagnose your skills early on. </strong>Even if you don&rsquo;t plan on starting your studying several months before the SAT, we advise you to take a diagnostic on Khan Academy (or complete the PSAT/NMSQT) six months before the test so you&rsquo;ll have a good sense of how close you are to your SAT goal. If you have a lot of skills to learn, you might want to start studying even earlier than you&rsquo;d planned. <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"5fd84f60-77f5-49ea-ac15-71b879ef5e68\" id=\"3beb3d90-b79c-49b0-8b2a-0f81e4513071\">Fariha</gs> suggests:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Figure out what areas you need to focus on the most, and keep practicing. Don&#39;t get discouraged if at first it is difficult to understand or learn, the more you practice the easier it will get.&rdquo;</em></li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Take at least two full practice tests.</strong> We recommend taking at least one toward the beginning of your studying, and one toward the end. We also recommend you take at least one practice test on paper, which is how the actual SAT is administered, so you can get comfortable with the format. Taking a full length practice test provides a realistic sense of how long the test is and where you tend to get tired or mentally blocked. Yes, it&rsquo;s at least three hours of hard work, but if your first full SAT is on test day, you may find yourself unpleasantly surprised by how taxing all of that intense thinking can be. <gs class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=\"9006690b-fcc2-4d31-ada3-28f1b16110ed\" id=\"85d97fc0-fd7b-4bd2-b744-7254c771c17f\">Gaeun</gs> says:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Full practice tests are invaluable.

"<p>Born Maria Antonia Montoya, Maria Martinez became one of the best-known Native potters of the twentieth century due to her excellence as a ceramist and her connections with a larger, predominantly non-Native audience. Though she lived at the Pueblo of San Ildefonso, about 20 miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, from her birth in 1887 until her death in 1980, her work and her life had a wide reaching importance to the Native art world by reframing Native ceramics as a fine art. Before the arrival of the railroad to the area in the 1880s, pots were used in the Pueblos for food storage, cooking, and ceremonies. But with inexpensive pots appearing along the rail line, these practices were in decline. By the 1910s, Ms. Martinez found a way to continue the art by selling her pots to a non-Native audience where they were purchased as something beautiful to look at rather than as utilitarian objects.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Maria Martinez shown with physicist Enrico Fermi, c. 1948\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/48ceba3abba93ab52633794bc134ac477c52b529.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Maria Martinez shown with physicist Enrico Fermi, c. 1948 (public domain;&nbsp;photo by U.S. Government employee made for U.S. Government)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>Her mastery as a ceramist was noted in her village while she was still young. She learned the ceramic techniques that were used in the Southwest for several millennia by watching potters from San Ildefonso, especially her aunt Nicholasa as well as potters (including Margaret Tafoya from Santa Clara), from other nearby Pueblos. All the raw materials had to be gathered and processed carefully or the final vessel would not fire properly. The clay was found locally. To make the pottery stronger it had to be mixed with a temper made from sherds of broken pots that had been pounded into a powder or volcanic ash. When mixed with water, the elasticity of the clay and the strength of the temper could be formed into different shapes, including a rounded pot (known as an <em>olla</em>) or a flat plate, using only the artist&rsquo;s hands as the potting wheel was not used. The dried vessel needed to be scraped, sanded, smoothed, then covered with a slip (a thin solution of clay and water). The slip was polished by rubbing a smooth stone over the surface to flatten the clay and create a shiny finish&mdash;a difficult and time-consuming process. Over the polished slip the pot was covered with designs painted with an iron-rich solution using either pulverized iron ore or a reduction of wild plants called guaco. These would be dried but required a high temperature firing to change the brittle clay to hard ceramics. Even without kilns, the ceramists were able to create a fire hot enough to transform the pot by using manure.</span></p>\n"

Similar to the pot pictured here, the design was based on pottery sherds found on an Ancestral Pueblo dig site dating to the twelfth to seventeenth centuries at what is now known as Bandelier National Monument. The Martinezes worked at the site, with Julian helping the archaeologists at the dig and Maria helping at the campsite. Julian Martinez spent time drawing and painting the designs found on the walls and on the sherds of pottery into his notebooks, designs he later recreated on pots. In the 1910s, Maria and Julian worked together to recreate the black-on-black ware they found at the dig, experimenting with clay from different areas and using different firing techniques. Taking a cue from Santa Clara pots, they discovered that smothering the fire with powdered manure removed the oxygen while retaining the heat and resulted in a pot that was blackened. This resulted in a pot that was less hard and not entirely watertight, which worked for the new market that prized decorative use over utilitarian value. The areas that were burnished had a shiny black surface and the areas painted with guaco were matte designs based on natural phenomenon, such as rain clouds, bird feathers, rows of planted corn, and the flow of rivers.</p>\n"

"<p>Born Maria Antonia Montoya, Maria Martinez became one of the best-known Native potters of the twentieth century due to her excellence as a ceramist and her connections with a larger, predominantly non-Native audience. Though she lived at the Pueblo of San Ildefonso, about 20 miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, from her birth in 1887 until her death in 1980, her work and her life had a wide reaching importance to the Native art world by reframing Native ceramics as a fine art. Before the arrival of the railroad to the area in the 1880s, pots were used in the Pueblos for food storage, cooking, and ceremonies. But with inexpensive pots appearing along the rail line, these practices were in decline. By the 1910s, Ms. Martinez found a way to continue the art by selling her pots to a non-Native audience where they were purchased as something beautiful to look at rather than as utilitarian objects.</p>\n"

"<p><span>Her mastery as a ceramist was noted in her village while she was still young. She learned the ceramic techniques that were used in the Southwest for several millennia by watching potters from San Ildefonso, especially her aunt Nicholasa as well as potters (including Margaret Tafoya from Santa Clara), from other nearby Pueblos. All the raw materials had to be gathered and processed carefully or the final vessel would not fire properly. The clay was found locally. To make the pottery stronger it had to be mixed with a temper made from sherds of broken pots that had been pounded into a powder or volcanic ash. When mixed with water, the elasticity of the clay and the strength of the temper could be formed into different shapes, including a rounded pot (known as an <em>olla</em>) or a flat plate, using only the artist&rsquo;s hands as the potting wheel was not used. The dried vessel needed to be scraped, sanded, smoothed, then covered with a slip (a thin solution of clay and water).

The footstool sits at an awkward unrealistic angle, but there are numerous attempts by the artist to show the body as a three-dimensional object in space. The right leg is tucked under the chair and the artist tries to show his viewer, through the use of curved lines and shading, that the leg has form. There is shading and consistency of perspective. The evangelist sitting on the chair strikes a believable pose.</p>\n"

"<p>It is generally thought that the first Aksumite coins were intended for international trade. These coins, bearing the name of King Endybis (c.&nbsp;270/290 C.E.), were mainly struck in gold and silver and followed the weight standard which existed in the Roman Empire. Initially, the symbols of the crescent and disc, which were common to the religions in South Arabia to which Aksum adhered, were used on early Aksumite coins. However, after the conversion of King Ezana around 340&ndash;356 C.E., a powerful statement was conveyed by the king&rsquo;s decision to replace the existing symbols with a cross which clearly denoted the importance that Christianity had in the kingdom. The coins also had a portrait of the ruler on the obverse and reverse of the coin along with teff, a local type of wheat. Inscriptions were another form of information included on the coins.</p>\n"

"<p>For most of us, architecture is easy to take for granted. Its everywhere in our daily lives&mdash;sometimes elegant, other times shabby, but generally ubiquitous. How often do we stop to examine and contemplate its form and style? Stopping for that contemplation offers not only the opportunity to understand one&rsquo;s daily surroundings, but also to appreciate the connection that exists between architectural forms in our own time and those from the past. Architectural tradition and design has the ability to link disparate cultures together over time and space&mdash;and this is certainly true of the legacy of architectural forms created by the ancient Greeks.</p>\n"

"<h3>Temple</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most recognizably &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; structure is the temple (even though the architecture of Greek temples is actually quite&nbsp;diverse). The Greeks referred to temples with the term ὁ &nu;&alpha;ό&sigmaf; (<em>ho na&oacute;s</em>) meaning &quot;dwelling;&quot;&nbsp;temple derives from the Latin term, <em>templum</em>. The earliest shrines were built to honor divinities and were made from&nbsp;materials such as a wood and mud brick&mdash;materials&nbsp;that typically don&#39;t survive very long. The basic form of the<em> naos</em> emerges as early as the tenth century B.C.E. as a simple, rectangular room with projecting walls (<em>antae</em>) that created a shallow porch. This basic form remained unchanged in its concept for centuries. In the eighth century B.C.E.&nbsp;Greek architecture begins&nbsp;to make the move from ephemeral materials (wood, mud brick, thatch) to permanent materials (namely, stone).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Archaic period the tenets of the Doric order of architecture in the Greek mainland became firmly established, leading to a wave of monumental temple building during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. Greek city-states invested substantial resources in temple building&mdash;as they competed with each other not just in strategic and economic terms, but also in their architecture. For example, Athens devoted enormous resources to the construction of the&nbsp;acropolis in the 5th century B.C.E.&mdash;in part so that Athenians could be confident&nbsp;that the temples built to honor their gods surpassed anything that their rival states could offer.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The multi-phase architectural development of sanctuaries such as that of Hera on the island of Samos demonstrate not only the change that occurred in construction techniques over time but also&nbsp;how the Greeks&nbsp;re-used&nbsp;sacred spaces&mdash;with the later phases built directly atop the preceding ones. Perhaps the fullest, and most famous, expression of Classical Greek temple architecture is the Periclean Parthenon of Athens&mdash;a Doric order structure, the Parthenon represents the maturity of the Greek classical form.</p>\n"

"Greek temples are often categorized in terms of their ground plan and the way in which the columns are arranged. A prostyle temple is a temple that has columns only at the front, while an amphiprostyle temple has columns at the front and the rear. Temples with a peripteral arrangement (from the Greek &pi;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu; (<em>pteron</em>) meaning &quot;wing) have a single line of columns arranged all around the exterior of the temple building. Dipteral temples simply have a double row of columns surrounding the building. One of the more unusual plans is the tholos, a temple with a circular ground plan; famous examples are attested at the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi and the sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidauros.</p>\n"

"<p>Stoa (&sigma;&tau;&omicron;ά) is a Greek architectural term that describes a covered walkway or colonnade that was usually designed for public use. Early examples, often employing the Doric order, were usually composed of a single level, although later examples (Hellenistic and Roman) came to be two-story freestanding structures. These later examples allowed interior space for shops or other rooms and often incorporated the Ionic order for interior colonnades.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Greek city planners came to prefer the stoa as a device for framing the agora (public market place) of a city or town. The South Stoa constructed as part of the sanctuary of Hera on the island of Samos (c. 700-550 B.C.E.) numbers among the earliest examples of the stoa in Greek architecture. Many cities, particularly Athens and Corinth, came to have elaborate and famous stoas. In Athens the famous Stoa Poikile (&ldquo;Painted Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., housed paintings of famous Greek military exploits including the battle of Marathon, while the Stoa Basileios (&ldquo;Royal Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., was the seat of a chief civic official (<em>archon basileios</em>).</p>\n"

At Corinth the stoa persisted as an architectural type well into the Roman period; the South Stoa there (above), c. 150 C.E., shows the continued utility of this building design for framing civic space. From the Hellenistic period onwards the stoa also lent its name to a philosophical school, as Zeno of Citium (c. 334-262 B.C.E.) originally taught his Stoic philosophy in the Stoa Poikile of Athens.</p>\n"

Theaters often took advantage of hillsides and naturally sloping terrain and, in general, utilized the panoramic landscape as the backdrop to the stage itself. The Greek theater is composed of the seating area (theatron), a circular space for the chorus to perform (orchestra), and the stage (<em>skene</em>). Tiered seats in the theatron provided space for spectators. Two side aisles (<em>parados</em>, pl. <em>paradoi</em>) provided access to the orchestra. The Greek theater inspired the Roman version of the theater directly, although the Romans introduced some modifications to the concept of theater architecture. In many cases the Romans converted pre-existing Greek theaters to conform to their own architectural ideals, as is evident in the Theater of Dionysos on the slopes of the Athenian Acropolis. Since theatrical performances were often linked to sacred festivals, it is not uncommon to find theaters associated directly with sanctuaries.</p>\n"

The bouleuterion generally was a covered, rectilinear building with stepped seating surrounding a central speaker&rsquo;s well in which an altar was placed. The city of Pri&egrave;ne has a particularly well-preserved example of this civic structure as does the city of Miletus.</p>\n"

"<h3>House</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Greek houses of the Archaic and Classical periods were relatively simple in design. Houses usually were centered on a courtyard that would have been the scene for various ritual activities; the courtyard also provided natural light for the often small houses. The ground floor rooms would have included kitchen and storage rooms, perhaps an animal pen and a latrine; the chief room was the <em>andron&mdash;</em>site of the male-dominated drinking party (<em>symposion</em>). The quarters for women and children (<em>gynaikeion</em>) could be located on the second level (if present) and were, in any case, segregated from the mens&rsquo; area. It was not <span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Plan, Olynthus (Greece), House A vii 4, built after 432 but before 348 B.C.E., from Olynthus, vol. 8 pl. 99, 100 and fig. 5 (photo: Perseus Digital Library)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/75c06bf3b223ae048bf1e30d69df4eb3e72a15c7.png\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Plan, Olynthus (Greece), House A vii 4, built after 432,&nbsp;before 348 B.C.E., from <em>Olynthus</em>, vol. 8 pl. 99, 100 and fig. 5, kitchen complex&nbsp;c, d, and e; &nbsp;andron (k)&nbsp;(photo: Perseus Digital Library)</span></span>uncommon for houses to be attached to workshops or shops. The houses excavated in the southwest part of the Athenian Agora had walls of mud brick that rested on stone socles and tiled roofs, with floors of beaten clay.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The city of Olynthus in Chalcidice, Greece, destroyed by military action in 348 B.C.E., preserves many well-appointed courtyard houses arranged within the Hippodamian grid-plan of the city. House A vii 4&nbsp;had a large cobbled courtyard that was used for domestic industry. While some rooms were fairly plain, with earthen floors, the <em>andron</em> was the most well-appointed room of the house.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Fortifications</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Fortifications, Palairos (Greece)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/ac9fa24828faa454e8f7884c04794c7be2bab7fa.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Fortifications and gate, Palairos (Greece)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Mycenaean fortifications of Bronze Age Greece (c. 1300&nbsp;B.C.E.)&nbsp;are particularly well known&mdash;the megalithic architecture (also referred to as Cyclopean because of the use of enormous stones) represents a trend in Bronze Age architecture.&nbsp;While these massive Bronze Age walls are difficult to best, first millennium B.C.E. Greece also shows evidence for stone built fortification walls. In Attika (the territory of Athens), a series of Classical and Hellenistic walls built in ashlar masonry (squared masonry blocks) have been studied as a potential system of border defenses. &nbsp;At Palairos in Epirus (Greece) the massive fortifications enclose a high citadel that occupies imposing terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Stadium, Gymnasium, and Palaestra</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Greek stadium (derived from <em>stadion</em>, a Greek measurement equivalent to c. 578 feet or 176 meters) was the location of foot races held as part of sacred games; these structures are often found in the context of sanctuaries, as in the case of &nbsp;the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Olympia and Epidauros. Long and narrow, with a horseshoe shape, the stadium occupied reasonably flat terrain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The gymnasium (from the Greek term <em>gymn&oacute;s</em> meaning &quot;naked&quot;) was a training center for athletes who participated in public games. This facility tended to include areas for both training and storage. The<em> </em>palaestra (&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;ί&sigma;&tau;&rho;&alpha;) was an exercise facility originally connected with the training of wrestlers. These complexes were generally rectilinear in plan, with a colonnade framing a central, open space.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Altar</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Altar of Hieron II \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3439d4bb1d27b21571fabf5110421aa649fc1ec5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Altar of Hieron II, 3rd century B.C.E.&nbsp;(Syracuse, Sicily, Italy)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Since blood sacrifice was a key component of Greek ritual practice, an altar was essential for these purposes. While altars did not necessarily need to be architecturalized, they could be and, in some cases, they assumed a monumental scale. The third century B.C.E. Altar of Hieron II at Syracuse, Sicily, provides one such example. At c. 196 meters in length and c. 11 m in height the massive altar was reported to be capable of hosting the simultaneous sacrifice of 450 bulls (Diodorus Siculus <em>History</em> 11.72.2).</p>\n"

The altar itself is screened by a monumental enclosure decorated with sculpture; the monument measures c. 35.64 by 33.4 meters. The altar is best known for its program of relief sculpture that depict a gigantomachy (battle between the Olympian gods and the giants) that is presented as an allegory for the military conquests of the kings of Pergamon. Despite its monumental scale and lavish decoration, the Pergamon altar preserves the basic and necessary features of the Greek altar: it is frontal and approached by stairs and is open to the air&mdash;to allow not only for the blood sacrifice itself but also for the burning of the thigh bones and fat as an offering to the gods.</p>\n"

The Southeast Fountain house in the Athenian Agora (c. 530 B.C.E.) provides an example of this tendency to position fountain houses and their dependable supply of clean drinking water close to civic spaces like the agora. Gathering water was seen as a woman&rsquo;s task and, as such, it offered the often isolated women a chance to socialize with others while collecting water. Fountain house scenes are common on ceramic water jars (<em>hydriai</em>), as is the case for a Black-figured hydria (c. 525-500 B.C.E.) found in an Etruscan tomb in Vulci that is now in the British Museum&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<h3>Legacy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The architecture of ancient Greece influenced ancient&nbsp;Roman architecture, and became the architectural vernacular employed in the expansive Hellenistic world created in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Greek architectural forms became implanted so deeply in the Roman architectural mindset that they endured throughout antiquity, only to then be re-discovered in the Renaissance and especially from the mid-eighteenth century onwards as a feature of the Neo-Classical movement. This durable legacy helps to explain why the ancient Greek architectural orders and the tenets of Greek design are still so prevalent&mdash;and visible&mdash;in our post-modern world.</p>\n"

"<p>For most of us, architecture is easy to take for granted. Its everywhere in our daily lives&mdash;sometimes elegant, other times shabby, but generally ubiquitous. How often do we stop to examine and contemplate its form and style? Stopping for that contemplation offers not only the opportunity to understand one&rsquo;s daily surroundings, but also to appreciate the connection that exists between architectural forms in our own time and those from the past. Architectural tradition and design has the ability to link disparate cultures together over time and space&mdash;and this is certainly true of the legacy of architectural forms created by the ancient Greeks.</p>\n"

"<h3>Temple</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The most recognizably &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; structure is the temple (even though the architecture of Greek temples is actually quite&nbsp;diverse). The Greeks referred to temples with the term ὁ &nu;&alpha;ό&sigmaf; (<em>ho na&oacute;s</em>) meaning &quot;dwelling;&quot;&nbsp;temple derives from the Latin term, <em>templum</em>. The earliest shrines were built to honor divinities and were made from&nbsp;materials such as a wood and mud brick&mdash;materials&nbsp;that typically don&#39;t survive very long. The basic form of the<em> naos</em> emerges as early as the tenth century B.C.E. as a simple, rectangular room with projecting walls (<em>antae</em>) that created a shallow porch. This basic form remained unchanged in its concept for centuries. In the eighth century B.C.E.&nbsp;Greek architecture begins&nbsp;to make the move from ephemeral materials (wood, mud brick, thatch) to permanent materials (namely, stone).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>During the Archaic period the tenets of the Doric order of architecture in the Greek mainland became firmly established, leading to a wave of monumental temple building during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. Greek city-states invested substantial resources in temple building&mdash;as they competed with each other not just in strategic and economic terms, but also in their architecture. For example, Athens devoted enormous resources to the construction of the&nbsp;acropolis in the 5th century B.C.E.&mdash;in part so that Athenians could be confident&nbsp;that the temples built to honor their gods surpassed anything that their rival states could offer.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The multi-phase architectural development of sanctuaries such as that of Hera on the island of Samos demonstrate not only the change that occurred in construction techniques over time but also&nbsp;how the Greeks&nbsp;re-used&nbsp;sacred spaces&mdash;with the later phases built directly atop the preceding ones. Perhaps the fullest, and most famous, expression of Classical Greek temple architecture is the Periclean Parthenon of Athens&mdash;a Doric order structure, the Parthenon represents the maturity of the Greek classical form.</p>\n"

"Greek temples are often categorized in terms of their ground plan and the way in which the columns are arranged. A prostyle temple is a temple that has columns only at the front, while an amphiprostyle temple has columns at the front and the rear. Temples with a peripteral arrangement (from the Greek &pi;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu; (<em>pteron</em>) meaning &quot;wing) have a single line of columns arranged all around the exterior of the temple building. Dipteral temples simply have a double row of columns surrounding the building. One of the more unusual plans is the tholos, a temple with a circular ground plan; famous examples are attested at the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi and the sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidauros.</p>\n"

"<p>Stoa (&sigma;&tau;&omicron;ά) is a Greek architectural term that describes a covered walkway or colonnade that was usually designed for public use. Early examples, often employing the Doric order, were usually composed of a single level, although later examples (Hellenistic and Roman) came to be two-story freestanding structures. These later examples allowed interior space for shops or other rooms and often incorporated the Ionic order for interior colonnades.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Greek city planners came to prefer the stoa as a device for framing the agora (public market place) of a city or town. The South Stoa constructed as part of the sanctuary of Hera on the island of Samos (c. 700-550 B.C.E.) numbers among the earliest examples of the stoa in Greek architecture. Many cities, particularly Athens and Corinth, came to have elaborate and famous stoas. In Athens the famous Stoa Poikile (&ldquo;Painted Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., housed paintings of famous Greek military exploits including the battle of Marathon, while the Stoa Basileios (&ldquo;Royal Stoa&rdquo;), c. fifth century B.C.E., was the seat of a chief civic official (<em>archon basileios</em>).</p>\n"

At Corinth the stoa persisted as an architectural type well into the Roman period; the South Stoa there (above), c. 150 C.E., shows the continued utility of this building design for framing civic space. From the Hellenistic period onwards the stoa also lent its name to a philosophical school, as Zeno of Citium (c. 334-262 B.C.E.) originally taught his Stoic philosophy in the Stoa Poikile of Athens.</p>\n"

Theaters often took advantage of hillsides and naturally sloping terrain and, in general, utilized the panoramic landscape as the backdrop to the stage itself. The Greek theater is composed of the seating area (theatron), a circular space for the chorus to perform (orchestra), and the stage (<em>skene</em>). Tiered seats in the theatron provided space for spectators. Two side aisles (<em>parados</em>, pl. <em>paradoi</em>) provided access to the orchestra. The Greek theater inspired the Roman version of the theater directly, although the Romans introduced some modifications to the concept of theater architecture. In many cases the Romans converted pre-existing Greek theaters to conform to their own architectural ideals, as is evident in the Theater of Dionysos on the slopes of the Athenian Acropolis. Since theatrical performances were often linked to sacred festivals, it is not uncommon to find theaters associated directly with sanctuaries.</p>\n"

In Attika (the territory of Athens), a series of Classical and Hellenistic walls built in ashlar masonry (squared masonry blocks) have been studied as a potential system of border defenses. &nbsp;At Palairos in Epirus (Greece) the massive fortifications enclose a high citadel that occupies imposing terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Stadium, Gymnasium, and Palaestra</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Greek stadium (derived from <em>stadion</em>, a Greek measurement equivalent to c. 578 feet or 176 meters) was the location of foot races held as part of sacred games; these structures are often found in the context of sanctuaries, as in the case of &nbsp;the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Olympia and Epidauros. Long and narrow, with a horseshoe shape, the stadium occupied reasonably flat terrain.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The gymnasium (from the Greek term <em>gymn&oacute;s</em> meaning &quot;naked&quot;) was a training center for athletes who participated in public games. This facility tended to include areas for both training and storage. The<em> </em>palaestra (&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;ί&sigma;&tau;&rho;&alpha;) was an exercise facility originally connected with the training of wrestlers. These complexes were generally rectilinear in plan, with a colonnade framing a central, open space.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Altar</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Altar of Hieron II \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3439d4bb1d27b21571fabf5110421aa649fc1ec5.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Altar of Hieron II, 3rd century B.C.E.&nbsp;(Syracuse, Sicily, Italy)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Since blood sacrifice was a key component of Greek ritual practice, an altar was essential for these purposes. While altars did not necessarily need to be architecturalized, they could be and, in some cases, they assumed a monumental scale. The third century B.C.E. Altar of Hieron II at Syracuse, Sicily, provides one such example. At c. 196 meters in length and c. 11 m in height the massive altar was reported to be capable of hosting the simultaneous sacrifice of 450 bulls (Diodorus Siculus <em>History</em> 11.72.2).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Model of the Pergamon Altar (Altar of Zeus), c. 200-150 B.C.E.

(Pergamon Museum, Berlin)&nbsp;photo:&nbsp;Steven Zucker&nbsp;(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span>Another spectacular altar is the Altar of Zeus from Pergamon, built during the first half of the second century B.C.E. The altar itself is screened by a monumental enclosure decorated with sculpture; the monument measures c. 35.64 by 33.4 meters. The altar is best known for its program of relief sculpture that depict a gigantomachy (battle between the Olympian gods and the giants) that is presented as an allegory for the military conquests of the kings of Pergamon. Despite its monumental scale and lavish decoration, the Pergamon altar preserves the basic and necessary features of the Greek altar: it is frontal and approached by stairs and is open to the air&mdash;to allow not only for the blood sacrifice itself but also for the burning of the thigh bones and fat as an offering to the gods.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Fountain house</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"Black-figured water-jar (hydria) with a scene at a fountain-house, Greek, about 520-500 B.C.E., 50.8 cm high, © The Trustees of the British Museum\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/52f143885999c38259d02c8d0c1b9eee3a63a283.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Black-figured water-jar (hydria) with a scene at a fountain-house</em>, Greek, about 520-500 B.C.E., 50.8 cm high, &copy; The Trustees of the British Museum</span></span>The fountain house is a public building that provides access to clean drinking water and at which water jars and containers could be filled. The Southeast Fountain house in the Athenian Agora (c. 530 B.C.E.) provides an example of this tendency to position fountain houses and their dependable supply of clean drinking water close to civic spaces like the agora. Gathering water was seen as a woman&rsquo;s task and, as such, it offered the often isolated women a chance to socialize with others while collecting water. Fountain house scenes are common on ceramic water jars (<em>hydriai</em>), as is the case for a Black-figured hydria (c. 525-500 B.C.E.) found in an Etruscan tomb in Vulci that is now in the British Museum&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Legacy</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The architecture of ancient Greece influenced ancient&nbsp;Roman architecture, and became the architectural vernacular employed in the expansive Hellenistic world created in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Greek architectural forms became implanted so deeply in the Roman architectural mindset that they endured throughout antiquity, only to then be re-discovered in the Renaissance and especially from the mid-eighteenth century onwards as a feature of the Neo-Classical movement. This durable legacy helps to explain why the ancient Greek architectural orders and the tenets of Greek design are still so prevalent&mdash;and visible&mdash;in our post-modern world.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Before talking about what you can learn next, let&#39;s review what you&#39;ve learned&nbsp;so far: JavaScript and ProcessingJS.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Review: JavaScript</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>There are many programming languages in the world, and JavaScript is one of the most popular ones. A programming language typically includes ways to store data in computer memory, ways to manipulate that data, ways to organize code and run code repeatedly. You learnt how to do all of that in JavaScript via:</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Variables</strong>: how to declare variables, assign, re-assign, and local vs. global scope.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Data types</strong>:&nbsp;numbers, booleans, strings, arrays, and objects.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Functions</strong>:&nbsp;how to group code into functions, pass arguments to them, and return values from them.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Conditionals</strong>: how to use if/else statements and logical expressions.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Loops</strong>: how to use while and for loops to repeat code.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you learn a new programming language, you will probably discover that it shares many of those constructs in common with JavaScript, and they often differ only in the exact syntax or subtle details.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Review: ProcessingJS</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>To give you a fun way to learn JavaScript here, we gave you a drawing &amp; animation &quot;library&quot; called ProcessingJS. That library is a collection of functions that you learnt how to use, and those functions know how to draw pixels into a canvas on the page. Here are examples of what you learnt how to use from ProcessingJS:</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Shapes</strong>: like rect(), ellipse(), and line()</li>\n"
"\t<li><span><strong>Colors</strong>: like fill(), stroke(), and background()</span></li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Text</strong>: like text() and textSize()</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Events</strong>: like draw() and mousePressed()</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Math</strong>: like random() and dist()</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you just use JavaScript without loading the ProcessingJS library, you will not have access to any of those functions. That&#39;s why we always load the library for you here.</p>\n"
"\n"

"<p>How is it that the Jews, called by Scripture &ldquo;the smallest of all the nations&rdquo; (Deut. 7:7) merit a section on religious architecture placed alongside the glories of Christendom, Islam, and Buddhism? After all, the Jews today number something around fourteen million, the same number that existed before the massacre of six million in Europe and the dissolution of communities across Europe and the Arab world during the 1940s. This is a numerical highpoint. In previous centuries, the numbers were far smaller.

"<h3>Longevity</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>What Jews lacked in territory, wealth and numbers, they made up for in longevity. Jews&mdash;short for &ldquo;the Judeans,&rdquo; trace their cultural heritage, and sometimes their physical lineage, to the biblical patriarchs&mdash;Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (also called Israel) and to the land of Israel (called in Roman times Judaea)&mdash;an unbroken chain of 3000 years. This is not just an &ldquo;imagined&rdquo; history. No other western community can assert&mdash;based upon rich documentary and physical evidence&mdash;to have encountered both Cyrus the Great and Innocent III, Caligula and Mohammed, Victoria, Stalin and Rembrandt. Though a minority, Jews maintained rich mimetic traditions across the empires that make up the &ldquo;Western world,&rdquo; and an astonishingly complex book culture that has sustained their sense of group cohesion. From antiquity to modern times, it was (and in many ways, still is) possible to travel from Jewish community to Jewish community from Persia to Spain and beyond&mdash;as travelers did&mdash;and find Jews who shared an all encompassing religious culture&mdash;even if they ate &ldquo;strange&rdquo; (though always&nbsp;kosher) foods, dressed &ldquo;funny&rdquo; (though males still wore the biblically mandated ritual &ldquo;fringes&rdquo;) and practiced &ldquo;strange&rdquo; local liturgical customs. Not speaking the same vernacular language, a visitor from, say, Germany might have communicated with his hosts in, say, Egypt, by drawing upon mix of &ldquo;peculiarly pronounced&rdquo; Hebrew and Aramaic gained through exposure to vast quantities of canonical religious texts.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Jews and their texts&mdash;not always together&mdash;have been active in what some textbooks still call &ldquo;the Western Experience&rdquo; from its beginning. The religious traditions associated with Jesus and Mohammed both assert that Jewish scripture, and interaction with Jews, is essential their own revelations, both of which assert relationship by virtue of having &quot;superseded&rdquo; the revelation of Moses. In other words, Jews &ldquo;matter&rdquo; to Christians and to Muslims, and by virtue of living among them, Christians and Muslims &ldquo;mattered&rdquo; to Jews.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>The study of Jewish art and architecture</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The academic study of Jewish architecture developed from the eighteenth century onward, when Christian Hebraists and bible scholars developed interests in biblical architecture&mdash;the Mosaic Tabernacle, the Solomonic Temple and the Herodian Temple&mdash;the latter visited by Jesus, who according to the Gospels predicted its destruction in 70 C.E. under emperor Vespasian. Post-&ldquo;biblical&rdquo; Jewish architecture did not become a focus of research until discoveries by the Palestine Exploration Fund of late antique synagogues during the 1860s. Medieval and early modern buildings took a bit longer to occasion scholarly interest. Jews in 19th century Europe, America and to some degree Islamic lands and south Asia, were engaged in a full-scale building boom; the largest since Herod the Great&rsquo;s rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple beginning 20/19 B.C.E. Newly emancipated and emancipating communities asserted their presence by building huge synagogues, experimenting with a wide range of forms, from neo-Egyptian to neo-classical and neo-moresque, eventually settling upon the modern yet traditionalist tones of art deco.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Only at the end of the 19th century did scholars begin to look back and study &ldquo;Jewish art,&rdquo; including Jewish architecture; often looking&mdash;whether intentionally or not&mdash;for roots for the contemporary boom in earlier periods. Hoping to prove that &ldquo;Jews do art too,&rdquo; Jews of all stripes hoped to prove their humanity through the creation and study of Jewish art. It was only in post-war New York that the first&mdash;and perhaps still the best&mdash;comprehensive surveys of Jewish religious architecture were written, both by art historian/architect Rachel Wischnitzer. These were entitled <em>European Synagogue Architecture</em> and <em>Synagogue Architecture in America</em>.&nbsp;By then, the State of Israel had been established, and &ldquo;Jewish art&rdquo;&mdash;including architecture&mdash;became the national art.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The canonical book of this process was Cecil Roth&rsquo;s <em>Jewish Art: An Illustrated History</em>, first published in Hebrew in 1958 and still in print in Hebrew. This anthology brought together scholars who had been scattered throughout the world due to the War to present a comprehensive history, from Solomon to the present. Architecture&mdash;until the modern period, all of it &ldquo;religious&rdquo; appears in every period and in almost every article, with some articles dedicated to this subject. The study of Jewish architecture has been of particular interest to Israeli scholars, but also to Americans and Europeans, and the Hebrew University&rsquo;s Center for Jewish Art has sent teams across the world to document historical synagogues&mdash;most no longer used. In Europe, this work takes on additional significance, as it has been spawned by a real interest to regain a now-lost heritage&mdash;particularly in the East, as Europe, particularly since the fall of Communism, has sought to develop a more tolerant European tradition and usable history.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In recent years, Jewish visual culture has been deeply assimilated into the academic study of Judaism, really for the first time. Cultural historians, working with art historians and architectural historians, have begun to focus upon the very elements of Jewish &ldquo;minority&rdquo; architecture that in previous generations were often spurned. The process by which a small minority group melded with its general environment, transforming and being transformed within that environment has become the stuff of contemporary scholarship. In many ways, the Jews have been the &ldquo;canary in the coal mine,&rdquo; the test case for theoretical discussion of what it means to live in diaspora and to be Europe&#39;s first, earliest and most intimate&mdash;colonized people.</p>\n"

"<p>Essay by Dr. Steven Fine</p>\n"

"<p>How is it that the Jews, called by Scripture &ldquo;the smallest of all the nations&rdquo; (Deut. 7:7) merit a section on religious architecture placed alongside the glories of Christendom, Islam, and Buddhism?

"<p>Imperial Chinese history is marked by the rise and fall of many dynasties and occasional periods of disunity, but overall the age was remarkably stable and marked by a sophisticated governing system that included the concept of a meritocracy. Each dynasty had its own distinct characteristics and in many eras encounters with foreign cultural and political influences through territorial expansion and waves of immigration also brought new stimulus to China. China was a highly literate society that greatly valued poetry and brush-written calligraphy, which along with painting, were called the Three Perfections, reflecting the esteemed position of the arts in Chinese life.&nbsp;Imperial China produced many technological advancements that have enriched the world, including paper and porcelain.</p>\n"

"<p>It is hard to summarize the impact of a movement that spanned centuries and continents, crossed social lines, and affected all levels of culture. However, there are a few central effects that can be highlighted.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Military orders</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>First, the earliest military orders originated in Jerusalem in the wake of the First Crusade. A miltary order is a&nbsp;religious order in which members take traditional monastic vows&mdash;communal poverty, chastity, and obedience&mdash;but also commit to violence on behalf of the Christian faith. Well-known examples include the Knights Templar (officially endorsed in 1129), the Knights Hospitaller (confirmed by papal bull in 1113), and the Teutonic Knights (originated in the late twelfth century).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The military orders represented a major theological and military development, and went on to play central roles in the formation of key political units that still exist today&nbsp;as nation-states.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Wall plaque, Ascalon, mid-twelfth to mid-thirteenth century (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem).

"\n"
"<h3>Territorial expansion</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Second, crusading played a major role in European territorial expansion. The First Crusade resulted in the formation of the crusader states in the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean), which were initially governed, and in small&nbsp;part populated, by settlers from Europe.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Crusading in northern and eastern Europe led to the expansion of kingdoms like Denmark and Sweden, as well as the creation of brand-new political units, for example in Prussia. As areas around the Baltic Sea were taken by the crusaders, traders and settlers&mdash;mostly German&mdash;moved in and profited economically.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the Mediterranean Sea, crusading led to the conquest and colonization of many islands, which arguably helped ensure Christian control of Mediterranean trade routes (at least for as long as the islands were held). Crusading also played a role in the conquest of the Iberian peninsula (now Spain and Portugal). This was finally completed in 1492, when the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand II and Isabella I conquered the last Muslim community on the peninsula&mdash;the city of Granada. They expelled Jews from the country in the same year. And of course, they also authorized and supported the expeditions of Christopher Columbus, who&mdash;like many European explorers of his day&mdash;believed that the expansion of the Christian faith was one of his duties.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Impact in Europe (religious and secular)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Third, the crusading movement impacted internal European development in a few important ways. The movement helped both to militarize the medieval western Church and to sustain criticism of that militarization. It arguably helped solidify&nbsp;the pope&rsquo;s control over the Church and made certain financial innovations central to Church operations. And it both reflected and influenced devotional trends. For example, while there was some dedication to St. George from the early Middle Ages, the intensity of that devotion soared in Europe after he reportedly intervened miraculously at the Battle of Antioch in 1098, during the First Crusade.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Secular political theories were influenced by crusading, especially in France and the Iberian peninsula, and government institutions evolved in part to meet the logistical needs of crusading. Credit infrastructures within Europe rose to meet similar needs, and some locales&mdash;Venice, in particular&mdash;benefitted significantly in economic terms.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It goes without saying that the crusades also had a highly negative effect on interfaith relations.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Impact world-wide</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Fourth, the crusading movement has left an imprint on the world as a whole. For example, many of the national flags of Europe incorporate a cross. In addition, &nbsp;many images of crusaders in our popular culture are indebted to the nineteenth century. Some in that century, like the novelist Sir Walter Scott, portrayed crusaders as brave and glamorous yet backward and unenlightened; simultaneously, they depicted Muslims&nbsp;as heroic, intelligent, and liberal. Others more wholeheartedly romanticized crusading.&nbsp;</p>\n"

In 1898 German Emperor Wilhelm II visited the grave of Saladin (Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb, a Muslim leader who led the recapture of Jerusalem in 1187) and was appalled at its state of disrepair.

"<h3>Common pitfalls to avoid</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Energy points:</strong> <a href=\"https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202487710-What-are-energy-points-\"><u>energy points</u></a> can be a rough estimate of effort, but some students may quickly figure out how to &ldquo;game the system&rdquo; if there&rsquo;s too much of an emphasis placed on them. &nbsp;Use energy points to motivate students, but make sure to triangulate this information with more details about the specific student activities (e.g. if they are working on skills that they should be working on) be wary of students watching videos on end or completing lots of skills that are too easy for them.<br />\n"
"\t&nbsp;</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Time:</strong> time is calculated very conservatively and includes all time students have spent actively engaged in the material, including both videos and skills. After two minutes of inactivity, a student is no longer counted as engaged. We count time conservatively so that it won&#39;t be easy for students to open KA, surf the web, and get credit for practicing math. With that said, it&#39;s common for students to take more than 2 minutes working out a problem. We encourage you to use time as a general benchmark, but to be generous if students say they have been on the site for longer.<br />\n"
"\t&nbsp;</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Struggling:</strong> Seeing lots of red in your reports isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. &nbsp;Struggling is part of learning, and we want students to feel safe practicing and attempting difficult skills. &nbsp;Encourage students to use hints and videos, seek help from peer tutors, and provide in-person support when necessary. &nbsp;When students finally master a skill that initially gave them trouble, recognize them not only for learning it but also for persevering and displaying a <a href=\"/curriculum-k12/a/motivate-students/\">growth mindset</a>.</li>\n"

"<h3>Common pitfalls to avoid</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Energy points:</strong> <a href=\"https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202487710-What-are-energy-points-\"><u>energy points</u></a> can be a rough estimate of effort, but some students may quickly figure out how to &ldquo;game the system&rdquo; if there&rsquo;s too much of an emphasis placed on them. &nbsp;Use energy points to motivate students, but make sure to triangulate this information with more details about the specific student activities (e.g. if they are working on skills that they should be working on) be wary of students watching videos on end or completing lots of skills that are too easy for them.<br />\n"
"\t&nbsp;</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Time:</strong> time is calculated very conservatively and includes all time students have spent actively engaged in the material, including both videos and skills. After two minutes of inactivity, a student is no longer counted as engaged. We count time conservatively so that it won&#39;t be easy for students to open KA, surf the web, and get credit for practicing math. With that said, it&#39;s common for students to take more than 2 minutes working out a problem. We encourage you to use time as a general benchmark, but to be generous if students say they have been on the site for longer.<br />\n"
"\t&nbsp;</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Struggling:</strong> Seeing lots of red in your reports isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. &nbsp;Struggling is part of learning, and we want students to feel safe practicing and attempting difficult skills. &nbsp;Encourage students to use hints and videos, seek help from peer tutors, and provide in-person support when necessary. &nbsp;When students finally master a skill that initially gave them trouble, recognize them not only for learning it but also for persevering and displaying a <a href=\"/curriculum-k12/a/motivate-students/\">growth mindset</a>.</li>\n"

"<p>You might notice that almost all of the shapes we&rsquo;ve been drawing so far are circles. This is convenient for a number of reasons, one of which is that we don&rsquo;t have to consider the question of rotation. Rotate a circle and, well, it looks exactly the same. However, there comes a time in all motion programmers&rsquo; lives when they want to draw something on the screen that points in the direction of movement. Perhaps you are drawing an ant, or a car, or a spaceship. And when we say &quot;point in the direction of movement,&quot; what we are really saying is &ldquo;rotate according to the velocity vector.&rdquo; Velocity is a vector, with an x and a y component, but to rotate in ProcessingJS we need an angle. Let&rsquo;s draw our trigonometry diagram one more time, with an object&rsquo;s velocity vector:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/bb9ae5e4f7e2df524a01ee227f32b62323a9a55f.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>OK. We know that the definition of tangent is:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">tangent(angle)=\\frac{velocity_y}{velocity_x}</code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The problem with the above is that we know velocity, but we don&rsquo;t know the angle. We have to solve for the angle. This is where a special function known as inverse tangent comes in, sometimes referred to as arctangent or tan-1. (There is also an inverse sine and an inverse cosine.)</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If the tangent of some value a equals some value b, then the inverse tangent of b equals a. For example:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table>\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>if</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>tangent(a) = b</td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>then</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>a = arctangent(b)</td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>See how that is the inverse? The above now allows us to solve for the angle:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table>\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>if</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>tangent(angle) = velocity_y / velocity_x</td>\n"

"\t\t\t<td>angle = arctangent(velocity_y / velocity_x)</td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now that we have the formula, let&rsquo;s see where it should go in our mover&rsquo;s display() function. Notice that in ProcessingJS, the function for arctangent is called <code>atan()</code>. JavaScript also provides <code>Math.atan()</code> natively (as well as all the basic trig functions), but we&#39;ll stick with the ProcessingJS provided functions.</p>\n"

"  <strong>rotate(angle);</strong>\n"
"  rect(0, 0, 30, 10);\n"
"  popMatrix();\n"
"};</code></pre>\n"

Rather than simply using <code>atan()</code> along with a bunch of conditional statements to account for positive/negative scenarios, ProcessingJS (along with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/atan2\">JavaScript</a> and pretty much all programming environments) has a nice function called <code>atan2()</code> that does it for you.</p>\n"

"<p>One of the things that we firmly believe in is the value of collaboration and learning from each other, especially when programming. &quot;Pair programming&quot; is one practice that promotes that, and is increasingly popular both in the industry and in coding academies, and if you have a classroom, then it&#39;s a practice you can introduce into yours!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In pair programming at its simplest, a pair of students will work together on a programming assignment. However, if you just tell your students to &quot;pair&quot;, you may find that one person does all the work, or they yell at each other, or just don&#39;t end up learning from each other. So it&#39;s useful to actually formally introduce pair programming and do it in a more structured way. Here&#39;s our recommendation:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>If you can, it can really help&nbsp;if you actually have &quot;pairing stations.&quot; Those are desks with two monitors and two keyboards, but the keyboards both control the same monitor. That makes it impossible for students to accidentally start working on their own computer.

"<p>One of the things that we firmly believe in is the value of collaboration and learning from each other, especially when programming. &quot;Pair programming&quot; is one practice that promotes that, and is increasingly popular both in the industry and in coding academies, and if you have a classroom, then it&#39;s a practice you can introduce into yours!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In pair programming at its simplest, a pair of students will work together on a programming assignment. However, if you just tell your students to &quot;pair&quot;, you may find that one person does all the work, or they yell at each other, or just don&#39;t end up learning from each other. So it&#39;s useful to actually formally introduce pair programming and do it in a more structured way. Here&#39;s our recommendation:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>If you can, it can really help&nbsp;if you actually have &quot;pairing stations.&quot; Those are desks with two monitors and two keyboards, but the keyboards both control the same monitor. That makes it impossible for students to accidentally start working on their own computer. Assuming pairing stations aren&#39;t in the budget, then you can approximate them by shutting every other monitor off.</li>\n"
"\t<li>On the first day that you introduce pair programming, talk about what it is and why we do it.

"<p>Roman architecture was unlike anything that had come before. The Persians, Egyptians, Greeks and Etruscans all had monumental architecture.

Buildings were designed to be impressive when viewed from outside because their architects all had to rely on building in a post-and-lintel system, which means that they used two upright posts, like columns, with a horizontal block, known as a lintel, laid flat across the top. A good example is this ancient Greek Temple in Paestum, Italy.</p>\n"

Romans became increasingly concerned with shaping interior space rather than filling it with structural supports. As a result, the inside of Roman buildings were as impressive as their exteriors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Materials, Methods and Innovations</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Long before concrete made its appearance on the building scene in Rome, the Romans utilized a volcanic stone native to Italy called tufa to construct their buildings. Although tufa never went out of use, travertine began to be utilized in the late 2nd century&nbsp;B.C.E. because it was more durable. Also, its off-white color made it an acceptable substitute for marble.</p>\n"

"c. 120-80 B.C.E., &nbsp;structure is&nbsp;travertine and&nbsp;tufa,&nbsp;stuccoed to look like Greek marble,&nbsp;Rome</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Marble was slow to catch on in Rome during the Republican period since it was seen as an extravagance, but after the reign of Augustus (31 B.C.E. - 14 C.E.), marble became quite fashionable. Augustus had famously claimed in his funerary inscription, known as the <em>Res Gestae</em>, that he &ldquo;found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble&rdquo; referring to his ambitious building campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman concrete (<em>opus caementicium</em>), was developed early in the 2nd c. BCE. &nbsp;The use of mortar as a bonding agent in ashlar masonry wasn&rsquo;t new in the ancient world; mortar was a combination of sand, lime and water in proper proportions. The major contribution the Romans made to the mortar recipe was the introduction of volcanic Italian sand (also known as &ldquo;pozzolana&rdquo;). &nbsp;The Roman builders who used pozzolana rather than ordinary sand noticed that their mortar was incredibly strong and durable. It also had the ability to set underwater. Brick and tile were commonly plastered over the concrete since it was not considered very pretty on its own, but concrete&rsquo;s structural possibilities were far more important. The invention of <em>opus caementicium</em> initiated the Roman architectural revolution, allowing for builders to be much more creative with their designs. Since concrete takes the shape&nbsp;of the mold or frame it is poured into, buildings began to take on ever more fluid and creative shapes.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Romans also exploited the opportunities afforded to architects by the innovation of the true arch (as opposed to a corbeled arch where&nbsp;stones are laid so that they move slightly in toward the center as they move higher).&nbsp;A true&nbsp;arch is composed of wedge-shaped blocks (typically of a durable stone), called voussoirs, with a key stone in the center holding them into place. In a true&nbsp;arch, weight is transferred from one voussoir down to the next, from the top of the arch to ground level, creating a sturdy building tool. True arches&nbsp;can span greater distances than a simple post-and-lintel.&nbsp;The use of concrete, combined with the employment of true arches allowed for vaults and domes to be built, creating expansive and breathtaking interior spaces.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Roman Architects</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about Roman architects. &nbsp;Few individual architects are known to us because the dedicatory inscriptions, which appear on finished buildings, usually commemorated the person who commissioned and paid for the structure. We do know that architects came from all walks of life, from freedmen all the way up to the Emperor Hadrian, and they were responsible for all aspects of building on a project. The architect would design the building and act as engineer; he would serve as contractor and supervisor and would attempt to keep the project within budget.</p>\n"

"<p>Roman cities were typically focused on the forum (a large open plaza, surrounded by important buildings), which was the civic, religious and economic heart of the city.

Roman architecture was not entirely comprised of concrete, however. &nbsp;Some buildings, which were made from marble, hearkened back to the sober, Classical beauty of Greek architecture, like the Forum of Trajan. &nbsp;Concrete structures and marble buildings stood side by side in Rome, demonstrating that the Romans appreciated the architectural history of the Mediterranean just as much as they did their own innovation. &nbsp;Ultimately, Roman architecture is overwhelmingly a success story of experimentation and the desire to achieve something new.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Roman architecture was unlike anything that had come before. The Persians, Egyptians, Greeks and Etruscans all had monumental architecture. The grandeur of their buildings, though, was largely external. Buildings were designed to be impressive when viewed from outside because their architects all had to rely on building in a post-and-lintel system, which means that they used two upright posts, like columns, with a horizontal block, known as a lintel, laid flat across the top. A good example is this ancient Greek Temple in Paestum, Italy.</p>\n"

Thanks to these innovations, from the first century&nbsp;C.E. Romans were able to create interior spaces that had previously been unheard of. Romans became increasingly concerned with shaping interior space rather than filling it with structural supports. As a result, the inside of Roman buildings were as impressive as their exteriors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Materials, Methods and Innovations</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Long before concrete made its appearance on the building scene in Rome, the Romans utilized a volcanic stone native to Italy called tufa to construct their buildings. Although tufa never went out of use, travertine began to be utilized in the late 2nd century&nbsp;B.C.E. because it was more durable. Also, its off-white color made it an acceptable substitute for marble.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Temple of Portunus (formerly known as, Fortuna Virilis), travertine, tufa, and stucco, c. 120-80 B.C.E., Rome \" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c8c9dc83eded999feaeac75e9db1f79177049bd3.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Temple of Portunus (formerly known as, Fortuna Virilis),<br />\n"
"c. 120-80 B.C.E., &nbsp;structure is&nbsp;travertine and&nbsp;tufa,&nbsp;stuccoed to look like Greek marble,&nbsp;Rome</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Marble was slow to catch on in Rome during the Republican period since it was seen as an extravagance, but after the reign of Augustus (31 B.C.E. - 14 C.E.), marble became quite fashionable. Augustus had famously claimed in his funerary inscription, known as the <em>Res Gestae</em>, that he &ldquo;found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble&rdquo; referring to his ambitious building campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Roman concrete (<em>opus caementicium</em>), was developed early in the 2nd c. BCE. &nbsp;The use of mortar as a bonding agent in ashlar masonry wasn&rsquo;t new in the ancient world; mortar was a combination of sand, lime and water in proper proportions. The major contribution the Romans made to the mortar recipe was the introduction of volcanic Italian sand (also known as &ldquo;pozzolana&rdquo;). &nbsp;The Roman builders who used pozzolana rather than ordinary sand noticed that their mortar was incredibly strong and durable. It also had the ability to set underwater. Brick and tile were commonly plastered over the concrete since it was not considered very pretty on its own, but concrete&rsquo;s structural possibilities were far more important. The invention of <em>opus caementicium</em> initiated the Roman architectural revolution, allowing for builders to be much more creative with their designs. Since concrete takes the shape&nbsp;of the mold or frame it is poured into, buildings began to take on ever more fluid and creative shapes.&nbsp;</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>The Romans also exploited the opportunities afforded to architects by the innovation of the true arch (as opposed to a corbeled arch where&nbsp;stones are laid so that they move slightly in toward the center as they move higher).&nbsp;A true&nbsp;arch is composed of wedge-shaped blocks (typically of a durable stone), called voussoirs, with a key stone in the center holding them into place. In a true&nbsp;arch, weight is transferred from one voussoir down to the next, from the top of the arch to ground level, creating a sturdy building tool. True arches&nbsp;can span greater distances than a simple post-and-lintel.&nbsp;The use of concrete, combined with the employment of true arches allowed for vaults and domes to be built, creating expansive and breathtaking interior spaces.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Roman Architects</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about Roman architects. &nbsp;Few individual architects are known to us because the dedicatory inscriptions, which appear on finished buildings, usually commemorated the person who commissioned and paid for the structure. We do know that architects came from all walks of life, from freedmen all the way up to the Emperor Hadrian, and they were responsible for all aspects of building on a project. The architect would design the building and act as engineer; he would serve as contractor and supervisor and would attempt to keep the project within budget.</p>\n"

They also used concrete extensively, including barrel vaults and domes throughout the complex. &nbsp;What makes the Golden House unique in Roman architecture is that Severus and Celer were using concrete in new and exciting ways; rather than utilizing the material for just its structural purposes, the architects began to experiment with concrete in aesthetic modes, for instance, to make expansive domed spaces. &nbsp;</p>\n"

"<p>Nero may have started a new trend for bigger and better concrete architecture, but Roman architects, and the emperors who supported them, took that trend and pushed it to its greatest potential. &nbsp;Vespasian&rsquo;s Colosseum, the Markets of Trajan, the Baths of Caracalla and the Basilica of Maxentius are just a few of the most impressive structures to come out of the architectural revolution in Rome. Roman architecture was not entirely comprised of concrete, however. &nbsp;Some buildings, which were made from marble, hearkened back to the sober, Classical beauty of Greek architecture, like the Forum of Trajan. &nbsp;Concrete structures and marble buildings stood side by side in Rome, demonstrating that the Romans appreciated the architectural history of the Mediterranean just as much as they did their own innovation. &nbsp;Ultimately, Roman architecture is overwhelmingly a success story of experimentation and the desire to achieve something new.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Three lyres were piled one on top of another. They were all made from wood which had decayed by the time they were excavated, but two of them, of which this is one, were entirely covered in sheet silver attached by small silver nails. The plaques down the front of the sounding box are made of shell. The silver cow's head decorating the front has inlaid eyes of shell and lapis lazuli. The edges of the sound box have a narrow border of shell and lapis lazuli inlay.  When found, the lyre lay in the soil. The metal was very brittle and the uprights were squashed flat. First it was photographed, and then covered in wax and waxed cloth to hold it together for lifting. The silver on the top and back edge of the sounding box had been destroyed. Some of the silver preserved the impression of matting on which it must have originally lain. Eleven silver tubes acted as the tuning pegs.  Such instruments were probably important parts of rituals at court and temple. There are representations of lyre players and their instruments on cylinder seals, and on the Standard of Ur being played alongside a possible singer.\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/07e39066e8f2713352dffebe99b5aa02e801dc46.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\"><em>Silver lyre from Ur</em>, c. 2600-2400 B.C.E., 106 x 97 cm,&nbsp;silver, shell, and lapis lazuli are original, the wood is&nbsp;reconstructed, southern Iraq&nbsp;<br />\n"

"\t<li>Be careful that the equation is arranged in the right form: <code class=\"latex\">ax^2 + bx + c = 0</code>&nbsp;or it won&rsquo;t work!</li>\n"
"\t<li>Make sure you take the square root of the whole <code class=\"latex\">(b^2 - 4ac)</code>, and that <code class=\"latex\">2a</code>&nbsp;is the denominator of everything above it</li>\n"
"\t<li>Watch your negatives: <code class=\"latex\">b^2</code>&nbsp;can&rsquo;t be negative, so if <code class=\"latex\">b</code>&nbsp;starts as negative, make sure it changes to a positive since the square of a negative or a positive is a positive</li>\n"
"\t<li>Keep the <code class=\"latex\">+/-</code>&nbsp;and always be on the look out for TWO solutions</li>\n"
"\t<li>If you use a calculator, the answer might be rounded to a certain number of decimal places. &nbsp;If asked for the exact answer (as usually happens) and the square roots can&rsquo;t be easily simplified, keep the square roots in the answer, e.g. <code class=\"latex\">\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{10}}{2}</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code class=\"latex\">\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{10}}{2}</code></li>\n"

"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Tem atenção que a equação tem estar na forma: <code class=\"latex\">ax^2 + bx + c = 0</code>&nbsp;ou não irá funcionar!</li>\n"
"\t<li>Certifica-te de que calculas a raiz quadrada do determinante<code class=\"latex\">(b^2 - 4ac)</code> e que usas o <code class=\"latex\">2a</code>&nbsp;como denominador de tudo</li>\n"
"\t<li>Cuidado com os números negativos: <code class=\"latex\">b^2</code>&nbsp;não pode ser negativo. Se <code class=\"latex\">b</code>&nbsp;começar como negativo, certifica-te de que muda de sinal, visto que o quadrado de um número negativo ou positivo é sempre positivo</li>\n"
"\t<li>Mantém o sinal <code class=\"latex\">+/-</code>&nbsp;e calcula sempre as DUAS soluções</li>\n"
"\t<li>Se utilizares uma calculadora, a resposta poderá vir arrendondada a um certo número de casas decimais. &nbsp;Se te pedirem um número exato (o que acontece com frequência) e se as raízes não forem facilmente simplificadas, mantém as raízes quadradas na resposta - como por exemplo, <code class=\"latex\">\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{10}}{2}</code>&nbsp;e&nbsp;<code class=\"latex\">\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{10}}{2}</code></li>\n"

"<p>This course&nbsp;is all about looking at the world around us and coming up with clever ways to simulate that world with code. We will start by looking at basic physics&mdash;how an apple falls from a tree, how a pendulum swings in the air, how the earth revolves around the sun, etc. Everything that we&#39;ll discuss here&nbsp;requires the use of the most basic building block for programming motion&mdash;the <strong><em>vector</em></strong>. And so this is where we begin our story.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now, the word vector can mean a lot of different things. Vector is the name of a New Wave rock band formed in Sacramento, CA in the early 1980s. It&rsquo;s the name of a breakfast cereal manufactured by Kellogg&rsquo;s Canada. In the field of epidemiology, a vector is used to describe an organism that transmits infection from one host to another. In the C++ programming language, a vector (std::vector) is an implementation of a dynamically resizable array data structure. While all these definitions are interesting, they&rsquo;re not what we&rsquo;re looking for. What we want is called a <strong><em>Euclidean vector</em></strong> (named for the Greek mathematician Euclid and also known as a geometric vector). When you see the term &ldquo;vector&rdquo; in this course, you can assume it refers to a Euclidean vector, defined as <em>an entity that has both magnitude and direction</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A vector is typically drawn as a arrow; the direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and the magnitude by the length of the arrow itself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"A diagram of a vector with magnitude and direction\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/60b0a7768992ead88f8fe12d834a1310d6dbcb27.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.1: A vector (drawn as an arrow) has magnitude (length of arrow) and direction (which way it is pointing).</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the above illustration, the vector is drawn as an arrow from point A to point B and serves as an instruction for how to travel from A to B.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why use vectors?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before we dive into more of the details about vectors, let&rsquo;s look at a basic program that demonstrates why we should care about vectors in the first place. If you went through the introductory JS course here on Khan Academy, you probably, at one point or another, learned how to write a simple bouncing ball program.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><iframe class=\"scratchpad\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"440\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/bouncing-ball-without-pvector/6602409044344832/embedded?embed=yes&amp;article=yes&amp;editor=yes&amp;buttons=yes&amp;author=yes\" width=\"790\"></iframe></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the above example, we have a very simple world&mdash;a blank canvas with a circular shape (a &ldquo;ball&rdquo;) traveling around. This ball has some properties, which are represented in the code as variables.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"table\">\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Location</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>x and y</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Velocity</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xspeed and yspeed</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In a more advanced program, we could imagine having many more variables:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"table\">\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Acceleration</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xacceleration and yacceleration</em></td>\n"

"\t\t\t<td>Friction</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xfriction and yfriction</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s becoming clearer that for every concept in this world (wind, location, acceleration, etc.), we&rsquo;ll need two variables. And this is only a two-dimensional world. In a 3D world, we&rsquo;ll need <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>xspeed</code>, <code>yspeed</code>, <code>zspeed</code>, and so on.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could simplify our code and use fewer variables?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Instead of:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var x = 5;\n"
"var y = 10;\n"
"var xspeed;\n"
"var yspeed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We could simply have two variables, where each variable is a vector-like object with two dimensions of information:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var location;\n"
"var speed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Taking this first step in using vectors won&rsquo;t allow us to do anything new. Just using vector-like objects for your variables won&rsquo;t magically make your program simulate physics. However, they will simplify your code and provide a set of functions for common mathematical operations that happen over and over and over again while programming motion.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As an introduction to vectors, we&rsquo;re going to live in two dimensions. All of these examples can be fairly easily extended to three dimensions (and the object we will use&mdash;<code>PVector</code>&mdash;allows for three dimensions.) However, it&rsquo;s easier to start with just two.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Programming with <code>PVector</code></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One way to think of a vector is the difference between two points. Consider how you might go about providing instructions to walk from one point to another.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>You&rsquo;ve probably done this before when programming motion. For every frame of animation (i.e. a single cycle through ProcessingJS&rsquo;s <span>draw()</span> loop), you instruct each object on the screen to move a certain number of pixels horizontally and a certain number of pixels vertically.<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagram of using a vector to predict new location\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2276479f68e971c0eee3f6e7c350104ff0ab036f.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.3</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For every frame:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong><em>new location = velocity applied to current location</em></strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If velocity is a vector (the difference between two points), what is location? Is it a vector too? Technically, one might argue that location is not a vector, since it&rsquo;s not describing how to move from one point to another&mdash;it&rsquo;s simply describing a singular point in space.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nevertheless, another way to describe a location is the path taken from the origin to reach that location. Hence, a location can be the vector representing the difference between location and origin.<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagram of location as a vector\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a106d0482f2e2a9850946b5c709676d443ff11de.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.4</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the underlying data for both location and velocity. In the bouncing ball example, we had the following:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"table\">\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Location</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>x and y</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Velocity</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xspeed and yspeed</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Notice how we are storing the same data for both&mdash;two floating point numbers, an <code>x</code> and a <code>y</code>. If we were to write a vector class ourselves, we&rsquo;d start with something rather basic:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var Vector = function(x, y) {\n"
"    this.x = x;\n"
"    this.y = y;\n"
"};</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At its core, a <code>PVector</code> is just a convenient way to store two values (or three, as we&rsquo;ll see in 3D examples).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>And so this &hellip;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var x = 100;\n"
"var y = 100;\n"
"var xspeed = 1;\n"
"var yspeed = 3.3;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>becomes &hellip;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var location = new PVector(100,100);\n"
"var velocity = new PVector(1,3.3);</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now that we have two vector objects (location and velocity), we&rsquo;re ready to implement the algorithm for motion&mdash;<strong><em>location = location + velocity</em></strong>. In Example 1.1, without vectors, we had:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>x = x + xspeed;\n"
"y = y + yspeed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In an ideal world, we would be able to rewrite the above as:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>location = location + velocity;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, in JavaScript, the addition operator + is reserved for primitive values (numbers, strings) only. In some programming languages, operators can be &quot;overloaded&quot;, but not in JavaScript. Fortunately for us, the <code>PVector</code> object includes methods for common mathematical operations, like <code>add()</code>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Vector Addition</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before we continue looking at the <code>PVector</code> object and its <code>add()</code> method, let&rsquo;s examine vector addition using the notation found in math and physics textbooks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Vectors are typically written either in boldface type or with an arrow on top. For the purposes of these lessons, to distinguish a <strong><em>vector</em></strong> from a <strong><em>scalar</em></strong> (<em>scalar</em> refers to a single value, such as an integer or a floating point number), we&rsquo;ll use the arrow notation:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Vector: <code class=\"latex\">\\vec{u}</code></p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Scalar: <code class=\"latex\">x<code class=\"latex\">​</code></code></p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have the following two vectors:<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagram of 2 vectors\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cea7e8e3d45aea8046f5f6dfffd7a46575bb70b2.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.5</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each vector has two components, an <code>x</code> and a <code>y</code>. To add two vectors together, we simply add both <code>x</code>&rsquo;s and both <code>y</code>&rsquo;s.&nbsp;<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3f3ef0e270aa3d7e9d1769580527de5de1c69882.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.6</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In other words:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\vec{w} = \\vec{u} + \\vec{v}</code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>can be written as:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\text{w}_x = \\text{u}_x + \\text{v}_x\\\\<br />\n"
"\\text{w}_y = \\text{u}_y + \\text{v}_y </code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Then, replacing <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> with their values from Figure 1.6, we get:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\text{w}_x = 5 + 3\\\\<br />\n"
"\\text{w}_y = 2 + 4 </code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>which means that:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\text{w}_x = 8\\\\<br />\n"
"\\text{w}_y = 6 </code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Finally, we write that as a vector:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\vec{w} = (8, 6)</code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now that we understand how to add two vectors together, we can look at how addition is implemented in the <code>PVector</code> object itself. Let&rsquo;s write a method called <code>add()</code> that takes another <code>PVector</code> object as its argument, and simply adds the x and y components together.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var Vector = function(x, y) {\n"
"    this.x = x;\n"
"    this.y = y;\n"
"};\n"
"\n"
"<strong>Vector.prototype.add = function(v) {\n"
"  this.y = this.y + v.y;\n"
"  this.x = this.x + v.x;\n"
"};</strong>\n"
"</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now that we see how <code>add()</code> is written inside of <code>PVector</code>, we can return to our bouncing ball example with its <strong><em>location + velocity</em></strong> algorithm and implement vector addition:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>location.add(velocity);</code></pre>\n"
"\n"

"<p>This course&nbsp;is all about looking at the world around us and coming up with clever ways to simulate that world with code. We will start by looking at basic physics&mdash;how an apple falls from a tree, how a pendulum swings in the air, how the earth revolves around the sun, etc. Everything that we&#39;ll discuss here&nbsp;requires the use of the most basic building block for programming motion&mdash;the <strong><em>vector</em></strong>. And so this is where we begin our story.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now, the word vector can mean a lot of different things. Vector is the name of a New Wave rock band formed in Sacramento, CA in the early 1980s. It&rsquo;s the name of a breakfast cereal manufactured by Kellogg&rsquo;s Canada. In the field of epidemiology, a vector is used to describe an organism that transmits infection from one host to another. In the C++ programming language, a vector (std::vector) is an implementation of a dynamically resizable array data structure. While all these definitions are interesting, they&rsquo;re not what we&rsquo;re looking for. What we want is called a <strong><em>Euclidean vector</em></strong> (named for the Greek mathematician Euclid and also known as a geometric vector). When you see the term &ldquo;vector&rdquo; in this course, you can assume it refers to a Euclidean vector, defined as <em>an entity that has both magnitude and direction</em>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A vector is typically drawn as a arrow; the direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and the magnitude by the length of the arrow itself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"A diagram of a vector with magnitude and direction\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/60b0a7768992ead88f8fe12d834a1310d6dbcb27.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.1: A vector (drawn as an arrow) has magnitude (length of arrow) and direction (which way it is pointing).</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the above illustration, the vector is drawn as an arrow from point A to point B and serves as an instruction for how to travel from A to B.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Why use vectors?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before we dive into more of the details about vectors, let&rsquo;s look at a basic program that demonstrates why we should care about vectors in the first place. If you went through the introductory JS course here on Khan Academy, you probably, at one point or another, learned how to write a simple bouncing ball program.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><iframe class=\"scratchpad\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"440\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/bouncing-ball-without-pvector/6602409044344832/embedded?embed=yes&amp;article=yes&amp;editor=yes&amp;buttons=yes&amp;author=yes\" width=\"790\"></iframe></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In the above example, we have a very simple world&mdash;a blank canvas with a circular shape (a &ldquo;ball&rdquo;) traveling around. This ball has some properties, which are represented in the code as variables.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"table\">\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Localização</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>x and y</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Velocity</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xspeed and yspeed</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In a more advanced program, we could imagine having many more variables:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"table\">\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Acceleration</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xacceleration and yacceleration</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Target location</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xtarget and ytarget</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Wind</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xwind and ywind</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Friction</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xfriction and yfriction</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It&rsquo;s becoming clearer that for every concept in this world (wind, location, acceleration, etc.), we&rsquo;ll need two variables. And this is only a two-dimensional world. In a 3D world, we&rsquo;ll need <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>xspeed</code>, <code>yspeed</code>, <code>zspeed</code>, and so on.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could simplify our code and use fewer variables?</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Instead of:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var x = 5;\n"
"var y = 10;\n"
"var xspeed;\n"
"var yspeed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>We could simply have two variables, where each variable is a vector-like object with two dimensions of information:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var location;\n"
"var speed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Taking this first step in using vectors won&rsquo;t allow us to do anything new. Just using vector-like objects for your variables won&rsquo;t magically make your program simulate physics. However, they will simplify your code and provide a set of functions for common mathematical operations that happen over and over and over again while programming motion.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>As an introduction to vectors, we&rsquo;re going to live in two dimensions. All of these examples can be fairly easily extended to three dimensions (and the object we will use&mdash;<code>PVector</code>&mdash;allows for three dimensions.) However, it&rsquo;s easier to start with just two.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Programming with <code>PVector</code></h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>One way to think of a vector is the difference between two points. Consider how you might go about providing instructions to walk from one point to another.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Here are some vectors and possible translations:&nbsp;<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagrams of vectors\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a540b898af1848f5bb69838877b9665ed26cca8d.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.2</span></span></p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>You&rsquo;ve probably done this before when programming motion. For every frame of animation (i.e. a single cycle through ProcessingJS&rsquo;s <span>draw()</span> loop), you instruct each object on the screen to move a certain number of pixels horizontally and a certain number of pixels vertically.<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagram of using a vector to predict new location\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2276479f68e971c0eee3f6e7c350104ff0ab036f.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.3</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For every frame:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong><em>new location = velocity applied to current location</em></strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If velocity is a vector (the difference between two points), what is location? Is it a vector too? Technically, one might argue that location is not a vector, since it&rsquo;s not describing how to move from one point to another&mdash;it&rsquo;s simply describing a singular point in space.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Nevertheless, another way to describe a location is the path taken from the origin to reach that location. Hence, a location can be the vector representing the difference between location and origin.<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagram of location as a vector\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a106d0482f2e2a9850946b5c709676d443ff11de.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.4</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the underlying data for both location and velocity. In the bouncing ball example, we had the following:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<table class=\"table\">\n"
"\t<tbody>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Localização</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>x and y</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t\t<tr>\n"
"\t\t\t<td>Velocity</td>\n"
"\t\t\t<td><em>xspeed and yspeed</em></td>\n"
"\t\t</tr>\n"
"\t</tbody>\n"
"</table>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Notice how we are storing the same data for both&mdash;two floating point numbers, an <code>x</code> and a <code>y</code>. If we were to write a vector class ourselves, we&rsquo;d start with something rather basic:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var Vector = function(x, y) {\n"
"    this.x = x;\n"
"    this.y = y;\n"
"};</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At its core, a <code>PVector</code> is just a convenient way to store two values (or three, as we&rsquo;ll see in 3D examples).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>And so this &hellip;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var x = 100;\n"
"var y = 100;\n"
"var xspeed = 1;\n"
"var yspeed = 3.3;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>becomes &hellip;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var location = new PVector(100,100);\n"
"var velocity = new PVector(1,3.3);</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now that we have two vector objects (location and velocity), we&rsquo;re ready to implement the algorithm for motion&mdash;<strong><em>location = location + velocity</em></strong>. In Example 1.1, without vectors, we had:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>x = x + xspeed;\n"
"y = y + yspeed;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In an ideal world, we would be able to rewrite the above as:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>location = location + velocity;</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>However, in JavaScript, the addition operator + is reserved for primitive values (numbers, strings) only. In some programming languages, operators can be &quot;overloaded&quot;, but not in JavaScript. Fortunately for us, the <code>PVector</code> object includes methods for common mathematical operations, like <code>add()</code>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Vector Addition</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Before we continue looking at the <code>PVector</code> object and its <code>add()</code> method, let&rsquo;s examine vector addition using the notation found in math and physics textbooks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Vectors are typically written either in boldface type or with an arrow on top. For the purposes of these lessons, to distinguish a <strong><em>vector</em></strong> from a <strong><em>scalar</em></strong> (<em>scalar</em> refers to a single value, such as an integer or a floating point number), we&rsquo;ll use the arrow notation:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Vector: <code class=\"latex\">\\vec{u}</code></p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t<p>Scalar: <code class=\"latex\">x<code class=\"latex\">​</code></code></p>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have the following two vectors:<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Diagram of 2 vectors\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cea7e8e3d45aea8046f5f6dfffd7a46575bb70b2.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.5</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each vector has two components, an <code>x</code> and a <code>y</code>. To add two vectors together, we simply add both <code>x</code>&rsquo;s and both <code>y</code>&rsquo;s.&nbsp;<span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3f3ef0e270aa3d7e9d1769580527de5de1c69882.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Figure 1.6</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In other words:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\vec{w} = \\vec{u} + \\vec{v}</code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>can be written as:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\text{w}_x = \\text{u}_x + \\text{v}_x\\\\<br />\n"
"\\text{w}_y = \\text{u}_y + \\text{v}_y </code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Then, replacing <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> with their values from Figure 1.6, we get:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\text{w}_x = 5 + 3\\\\<br />\n"
"\\text{w}_y = 2 + 4 </code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>which means that:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\text{w}_x = 8\\\\<br />\n"
"\\text{w}_y = 6 </code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Finally, we write that as a vector:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><code class=\"latex\">\\vec{w} = (8, 6)</code></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now that we understand how to add two vectors together, we can look at how addition is implemented in the <code>PVector</code> object itself. Let&rsquo;s write a method called <code>add()</code> that takes another <code>PVector</code> object as its argument, and simply adds the x and y components together.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>var Vector = function(x, y) {\n"
"    this.x = x;\n"
"    this.y = y;\n"
"};\n"
"\n"
"<strong>Vector.prototype.add = function(v) {\n"
"  this.y = this.y + v.y;\n"
"  this.x = this.x + v.x;\n"
"};</strong>\n"
"</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now that we see how <code>add()</code> is written inside of <code>PVector</code>, we can return to our bouncing ball example with its <strong><em>location + velocity</em></strong> algorithm and implement vector addition:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<pre>\n"
"<code>location.add(velocity);</code></pre>\n"
"\n"
"<p>And now we&#39;re ready to rewrite the bouncing ball example using the <code>PVector</code> object! Take a look through the code and note the differences from before.</p>\n"

"<p>To give fellow teachers an idea for how they can teach our curriculum in a classroom setting, we are creating case studies. Here&#39;s one case study of how teacher Ellen Reller uses our curriculum in her classroom.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>What classes are you using the Khan Academy programming platform&nbsp;for?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I have two programming classes this semester. One has 32 students (10 females, 22 males) and the other has 25 (16 females, 9 males). We meet every day for 40 minutes. Most of the students have computer(s) at home, but may not have access it because it&#39;s shared with other family members, so for many of them, this is the only time they have to code. Additionally,&nbsp;since this is an elective class, they may not make much time to code at home because of the demands of their other classes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>What curriculum are you teaching?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the beginning, I taught the traditional way, using Powerpoint presentations, and then asked students to use Khan to create the programs.&nbsp;Soon in, I&nbsp;started using Khan in addition to those Powerpoints, to show students what they could do by demonstrating it in my own programs.&nbsp;</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/84e5bc997239221a655ca169a6514b5025834b83.png\" style=\"width:250px\" /></span>Then I gave the first&nbsp;assignment,&nbsp;a set of 6 progressively harder drawings,&nbsp;and gave students 2 weeks to work on them. As I&#39;d walk around the room, I would pay close attention to their questions,&nbsp;and I would tailor the next lessons I gave around those questions. I keep those lessons to less than 10 minutes at the beginning of each class, to give students a lot of time to work on their programs. I try to teach with&nbsp;programs that they can re-use, adapt, and change as they learn more.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the start of the 3rd week we started animation, and that&#39;s when I started playing the Khan Academy talk-throughs directly. Students had very good reactions to them. I spend a lot of time walking around the class to see what the kids are doing and being there if they need help or ideas.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Because this was the first semester that our school is using Khan Academy for CS, I almost felt like using the pre-made curriculum was like cheating or something -- the teacher who taught the course before me had designed all of his own curriculum and I felt like I should do the same. Then I started thinking about how I teach other classes from text books that I didn&#39;t write and how similar Khan CS lessons were like that. That let me relax a lot.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now, I spend much of&nbsp;my time thinking&nbsp;about&nbsp;how to bring out the power of us all coming together in the same room to learn to program. The students naturally ask each other a lot of questions, bounce ideas off each other, and help each other debug their code. After the assignments are due, the students share their programs with the whole class, and that&#39;s a lot of fun. One of the things that we&nbsp;plan to try soon is pair programming, as an additional form of interaction.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>What are some cool assignments you&#39;ve done?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Having taken many art classes that involve learning a skill as well as using a creative process, I knew that developing good assignments would be key to getting students to jump right in. I didnt want to restrict the students who already had ideas of what they wanted to do and I didn&#39;t want to intimidate students who didn&#39;t have any ideas where to start. I combined ideas from Khan with some of my own -- and this collection produced some fun results and really developed their design and drawing skills -- I&#39;m pleased at how fast the students can code drawings and are able to think a project out in their heads and then start coding.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For drawing, our mini-assignments for the first two weeks&nbsp;were: Olympic Rings, Animal, Landscape (flowers, mountains, city&hellip;), Self Portrait, Abstract Design. For the bigger drawing assignment after those, students had to choose a book they had read&nbsp;read in an English class at Lowell and without using any text, create a book cover for it. We had a lot of fun together, guessing what each book was!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For animation, students did the official Khan projects, Public Transportation and Design an Ad, and enjoyed both of them very much.</p>\n"

"<p><span class=\"image-wrapper inline-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/84e5bc997239221a655ca169a6514b5025834b83.png\" style=\"width:250px\" /></span>Then I gave the first&nbsp;assignment,&nbsp;a set of 6 progressively harder drawings,&nbsp;and gave students 2 weeks to work on them. As I&#39;d walk around the room, I would pay close attention to their questions,&nbsp;and I would tailor the next lessons I gave around those questions. I keep those lessons to less than 10 minutes at the beginning of each class, to give students a lot of time to work on their programs. I try to teach with&nbsp;programs that they can re-use, adapt, and change as they learn more.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At the start of the 3rd week we started animation, and that&#39;s when I started playing the Khan Academy talk-throughs directly. Students had very good reactions to them. I spend a lot of time walking around the class to see what the kids are doing and being there if they need help or ideas.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Because this was the first semester that our school is using Khan Academy for CS, I almost felt like using the pre-made curriculum was like cheating or something -- the teacher who taught the course before me had designed all of his own curriculum and I felt like I should do the same. Then I started thinking about how I teach other classes from text books that I didn&#39;t write and how similar Khan CS lessons were like that. That let me relax a lot.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Now, I spend much of&nbsp;my time thinking&nbsp;about&nbsp;how to bring out the power of us all coming together in the same room to learn to program. The students naturally ask each other a lot of questions, bounce ideas off each other, and help each other debug their code. After the assignments are due, the students share their programs with the whole class, and that&#39;s a lot of fun. One of the things that we&nbsp;plan to try soon is pair programming, as an additional form of interaction.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><strong>What are some cool assignments you&#39;ve done?</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Having taken many art classes that involve learning a skill as well as using a creative process, I knew that developing good assignments would be key to getting students to jump right in. I didnt want to restrict the students who already had ideas of what they wanted to do and I didn&#39;t want to intimidate students who didn&#39;t have any ideas where to start. I combined ideas from Khan with some of my own -- and this collection produced some fun results and really developed their design and drawing skills -- I&#39;m pleased at how fast the students can code drawings and are able to think a project out in their heads and then start coding.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For drawing, our mini-assignments for the first two weeks&nbsp;were: Olympic Rings, Animal, Landscape (flowers, mountains, city&hellip;), Self Portrait, Abstract Design. For the bigger drawing assignment after those, students had to choose a book they had read&nbsp;read in an English class at Lowell and without using any text, create a book cover for it. We had a lot of fun together, guessing what each book was!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>For animation, students did the official Khan projects, Public Transportation and Design an Ad, and enjoyed both of them very much.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Check out a montage of those assignments below:</p>\n"

"\n"
"<h2>Curriculum overview</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Our Intro to JS courses teaches the basics of programming in the JavaScript language, using the ProcessingJS library on top for drawing and animation. That means that we teach all the basic concepts in the language, but our use case for them is visual. For example, when we talk about nested for loops, we demonstrate how we can make a grid of gems on our screen.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The curriculum is viewable here:&nbsp;<a href=\"/cs/programming\">https://www.khanacademy.org/programming</a><u>&nbsp;</u></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Topics covered, in order:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>Basic statement syntax</li>\n"
"\t<li>Variables</li>\n"
"\t<li>Math operators, assignment operators</li>\n"
"\t<li>Strings</li>\n"
"\t<li>Functions</li>\n"
"\t<li>Logic and conditionals</li>\n"
"\t<li>Loops</li>\n"
"\t<li>Arrays</li>\n"
"\t<li>Objects</li>\n"
"\t<li>Object-oriented JS</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h2><span>Materials offered</span></h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Our course is made up of three types of materials:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Talk-throughs</strong>: These are our approach to videos, the way that we teach new concepts. Like Khan&rsquo;s videos, they&rsquo;re around 5 minutes long and teach one concept at a time. We present the code on the left, output on the right, and narrate as we write new code, while the output updates live. The student can pause the talk-through at any point, change the code, and see the new output, which is one way we encourage more interactive learning. The talk-throughs have transcripts for deaf students, and are partially translated into Spanish, French, and Portuguese.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Challenges</strong>: This is how we assess whether students understand the concept we just taught, and there is one challenge for every talk-through. Each challenge starts off with some code and has a series of steps with instructions and hint code for each step. We analyze their code as they type and offer messages to guide them in the right direction, when we see they&rsquo;ve made a common mistake. When they complete the steps, they earn points and their progress is logged on their activity dashboard.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Projects</strong>: The projects are our opportunity to give students to be very creative with the concepts they&rsquo;ve just learnt. They have a general set of guidelines but students can take them in their own direction. For example, after learning how to draw and color, students do &ldquo;What&rsquo;s for Dinner?&rdquo;, drawing their favorite dinner on a plate using the commands they&rsquo;ve learnt. They are not currently graded for these projects, but a code review process is currently being developed for them.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Review articles: </strong>These are a great way for students to review what they&#39;ve just learned, both immediately after learning it and later on as a refresher.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The course currently consists of <strong>40 talk-throughs</strong>, <strong>35&nbsp;challenges</strong>, and 10<strong>&nbsp;projects</strong>. On average, the talk-throughs are 6 minutes long, the challenges take 5 minutes each to complete, and projects are often completed in 10-40 minutes, depending on how far the student wants to take them. There is thus around 15 hours of curriculum.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The curriculum is designed to be learnable by 4th graders and up. Math-wise, it requires the student to be comfortable with fractions/proportions, the idea of one number being a fraction the size of another, and that is a topic that is required in 3rd grade math in the US. Besides that, students should feel comfortable with typing.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Accessibility</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span>This curriculum and platform works on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE9+). It works on the iPad, but students may find it&#39;s not as enjoyable to type on that keypad.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The&nbsp;curriculum is mostly <strong>translated</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://es-es.khanacademy.org/cs/programming\">Spanish</a>, with interactive subtitles for the talk-throughs (not dubbing).&nbsp;There is partial translation for Portuguse, Hebrew, Polish, and French.&nbsp;If you are able to help with translation, you may be able to sign up as a volunteer translator.

"\n"
"<p><span>This curriculum is usable by <strong>deaf students</strong>. T</span><span>here is a&nbsp;transcript option available for the talk-throughs, which are the only aspect of the curriculum with audio. Click the gear menu next to the play bar and select &quot;Interactive Transcript&quot;. Students can pause if it is going too quickly.</span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Authors</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The curriculum was developed by full-time Khan employee <a href=\"http://www.pamelafox.org\">Pamela Fox</a>, with some talk-throughs voiced by previous interns <a href=\"http://www.swestwood.com/\">Sophia Westwood</a> and <a href=\"http://cakefordinner.com/\">Jessica Liu</a>.

"<p>What does the Taj Mahal have to do with the Tamerlane? What do Persian carpets have to do with Turkish tiles? Quite a bit, as it turns out. By the fourteenth century, Islam had spread as far East as India and Islamic rulers had solidified their power by establishing prosperous cities and a robust trade in decorative arts along the all-important Silk Road.&nbsp;This is a complex period with competing and overlapping cultures and empires. Read below for an introduction to the later Islamic dynasties.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Ottoman (1300-1924)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>At its earliest stages, the Ottoman state was little more than a group formed as a result of the dissolution of the Anatolian Seljuq sultanate. However, in 1453, the Ottomans captured the great Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and in 1517, they defeated the Mamluks and took control of the most significant state in the Islamic world.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Mimar Sinan, Süleymaniye Mosque built for the Sultan Süleyman the Lawgiver, 1558, Istanbul\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/817ed1bd1be8379d1a2e141af26e5d413d5aecf6.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Mimar Sinan, S&uuml;leymaniye Mosque built for the Sultan S&uuml;leyman the Lawgiver, 1558, Istanbul</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>While the Ottomans ruled for many centuries, the height of the empire&#39;s cultural and economic prosperity was achieved during S&uuml;leyman the Magnificent&#39;s reign (r. 1520-1566), a period often referred to as the Ottoman&#39;s &lsquo;golden age.&rsquo; In addition to large-scale architectural projects, the decorative arts flourished, chief among them, ceramics, particularly tiles. Iznik tiles, named for the city in Anatolia where they were produced, developed a trademark style of curling vines and flowers rendered in beautiful shades of blue and turquoise. These designs were informed by the blue and white floral patterns found in Chinese porcelain&mdash;similar to earlier Mamluk tiles, and Timurid art to the East. In addition to Iznik, other artistic hubs developed, such as Bursa, known for its silks, and Cairo for its carpets. The capital, Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), became a great center for all matters of cultural importance from manuscript illumination to architecture.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Sinan, Rüstem Paşa Mosque, mihrab and minbar \n"
"Mimar Sinan, Rüstem Pasha Mosque, 1561-63 (Istanbul)\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/3e7feeb1fc561e3507e1e491ea92327bbf748cce.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Iznik tiles in&nbsp;Sinan,&nbsp;R&uuml;stem Pasha Mosque, 1561-63 (Istanbul)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The architecture of the period, both sacred and secular, incorporates these decorative arts, from the dazzling blue tiles and monumental calligraphy that adorn the walls of Topkapi Palace (begun 1459) to the carpets that line the floors of the S&uuml;leymaniye Mosque (1550-1558). Ottoman mosque architecture itself is marked by the use of domes, widely used earlier in Byzantium, and towering minarets. The Byzantine influence draws primarily from Hagia Sophia, a former church that was <a href=\"/humanities/medieval-world/byzantine1/constantinople-east/v/hagia-sophia-mosque\">converted into a mosque</a> (and is now a museum).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Timurid (1369-1502)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/73129983bd866cd1ea05fb6d632a90d2c01cf536.png\" /><br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-caption\">Timurid Dynasty at its greatest extent</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This powerful Central Asian dynasty was named for its founder, Tamerlane (ruled 1370-1405), which is derived from Timur the Lame. Despite his rather pathetic epithet, he claimed to be a descendent of Genghis Khan and demonstrated some of his supposed ancestor&rsquo;s ruthlessness in conquering neighboring territories.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>After establishing a vast empire, Timur developed a monumental architecture befitting his power, and sought to make Samarkand the &ldquo;pearl of the world.&rdquo; Because the capital was situated at a major crossroads of the Silk Road (the crucial trade route linking the Middle East, Central Asia, and China), and because Timur had conquered so widely, the Timurids acquired a myriad of artisans and craftspeople from distinct artistic traditions. The resulting style synthesized aesthetic and design principles from as far away as India (then Hindustan) and the lands in between.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/07c17fea1d543b4a018d924ea304e03ff154350f.jpg\" /><br />\n"
"<span class=\"image-caption\">Registan, Samarkand, Uzbekistan, 15th-17th centuries</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The result can be seen in cities filled with buildings created on a lavish scale that exhibited tall, bulbous domes and the finest ceramic tiles. The structures and even the cities themselves are often described foremost by the overwhelming use of blues and golds. While the Timurid dynasty itself was short-lived, its legacy survives not only in the grand architecture that it left behind but in its descendents who went on to play significant roles in the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal empires.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Safavid (1502-1736)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Safavids, a group with roots in the Sufic tradition (a mystical branch of Islam), came to power in Persia, modern-day Iran and Azerbaijan. In 1501 the Safavid rulers declared Shi&rsquo;a Islam as its state religion; and in just ten years the empire came to include all of Iran.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The art of manuscript illumination was highly prized in the Safavid courts, and royal patrons made many large-scale commissions. Perhaps the most notable of these is the Shahnama (or &lsquo;Book of Kings,&rsquo; a compilation of stories about earlier rulers of Iran) from the 1520s. While painting in this context did not have the same prominent and longstanding tradition as it does in Western art, the illustrations exhibit masterful workmanship and an incredible attention to detail.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Trade in carpets was also important, and even today, people understand the appeal of Persian carpets. These large-scale, high-quality pieces were created as luxurious furnishings for royal&nbsp;courts. The most famous&mdash;perhaps of all time&mdash;is a pair known as the Ardabil Carpets, created in 1539-1540. The carpets were nearly identical, perfectly symmetrical and enormous. Every inch of space was filled with flowers, scrolling vines, and medallions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The empire began to struggle financially and militarily until the rule of Shah Abbas (r. 1587-1629). He moved the capital to Isfahan where he built a magnificent new city and established state workshops for textiles, which, along with silk and other goods, were increasingly exported to Europe. The mosque architecture made use of earlier Persian elements, like the four-iwan plan and building materials of brick and glazed tiles reminiscent of Timurid architecture, with its blues and greens and bulbous domes. Even in such far-removed lands, the connections between these dynasties are evident in the art they created.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Mughal (1526-1858)</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Though Islam had been introduced in India centuries before, the Mughals were responsible for some of the greatest works of art produced in the canons of both Indian and Islamic art. The empire established itself when Babur, himself a Timurid prince of Turkish and Central Asian descent, came to Hindustan and defeated the existing Islamic sultanate in Delhi.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Tracing their roots to Central Asia, the Mughals produced art, music and poetry that was highly influenced by Persian and Central Asian aesthetics. This is evident in the style and importance given to miniature paintings, created to illustrate manuscripts. The most grandiose of these was the Akbarnama, created to record the conquests of Akbar, widely regarded as the greatest Mughal emperor. The art and architecture created during his reign demonstrate a synthesis of indigenous Indian temple architecture with structural and design elements derived from Islamic sources farther West. The Mughals developed a unique architectural style which, in the years after Akbar&rsquo;s reign, began to feature scalloped arches and stylized floral designs in white marble. The most famous example is the Taj Mahal, constructed by Shah Jahan from 1632-1653.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p><span class=\"block-image image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"Taj Mahal, Agra, India, 1632-53\" src=\"https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6e43b8c6ad1cc49db1f5eb3334df58f36d5fac14.jpg\" /><span class=\"image-caption\">Taj Mahal, Agra, India, 1632-53, photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mknott/1352093343\">Mathew Knott</a>&nbsp;(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</span></span></p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Mughal dynasty left a lasting mark on the landscape of India, and remained in power until the British completed their conquest of India in the nineteenth century.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Although historians generally agree that the major Islamic dynasties end in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Islamic art and culture have continued to flourish. Muslim artists and Muslim countries are still producing art. Some art historians consider such work as simply modern or contemporary art while others see it within the continuity of Islamic art.</p>\n"

"<h3>Visiting a bookseller</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The similarities run much further than mere physical traits, however. Take for example the manner in which the book was made and acquired from the 13th century onwards. If you wanted a book in the later Middle Ages you went to a store, as in our modern day. However, the bookseller did not normally have any books in stock&mdash;except for perhaps some second-hand copies. You would tell him what you wanted, both content-wise and with respect to the object&rsquo;s material features. You could specify, for example, that he use paper (instead of parchment), cursive script (and not book script) and add miniatures (or forego&nbsp;decoration). Just like so many other objects you bought in late-medieval society, the commercially-made manuscript was custom-tailored to the individual who purchased it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The professionals who made books for profit were usually found near the biggest church in town. This was a well-chosen spot as canons and clerics (i.e. people who visited the church and who could read) formed an important part of the clientele. By the 14th century true communities of the book had formed in the neighborhoods around churches and cathedrals. Evidence from such cities as Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, London and Paris suggests that in these communities a diverse group of artisans interacted with clients and with each other. It was a world bound not only by the book, however, but also by profit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Marketing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Whether you were scribe, illuminator or binder, as a professional you would strive for quality and diversity as this ensured bread and butter on the table. In parallel to our modern book business, medieval manuscript artisans used various marketing strategies to attract new clientele. The most striking of these is advertisements. Scribes hung large sheets outside their doors to show what kind of scripts they had mastered. The short writing samples found on these sheets were often accompanied by the names of the scripts, which shows just how professional the world of the book had become. A particularly rich specimen survives from the shop of Herman Strepel, a professional scribe in M&uuml;nster (c. 1447). In the true spirit of medieval marketing he wrote the names of all the scripts in golden letters on his advertisement sheet.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Scribes also included advertisements in books they had copied for a client. An example of such &ldquo;spam&rdquo; is found in a French manuscript made in Paris by a scribe who calls himself Herneis. On the last page of the book he writes, &ldquo;If someone else would like such a handsome book, come and look me up in Paris, across the Notre Dame cathedral.&rdquo; Herneis and his fellow bookmen lived and worked in the Rue Neuve Notre Dame, which served as the center of commercially-made vernacular books. Similarly, students were served in the Rue St Jacques, on the Left Bank, where the latest Latin textbooks were on offer. For Parisians and students it was handy to have all the professionals in one street: you knew where to go when you needed a book and it was easy to check out who was available for making one for you.</p>\n"

"<p>This centralization was equally convenient, however, for the artisans themselves. Booksellers (also called stationers) in Rue Neuve Notre Dame and in other such &ldquo;book streets&rdquo; in European cities depended on the professional scribes, illuminators and binders that lived in their vicinity. They would hire them for various projects. When a client came to order a book from a stationer, the latter would divide the work among the artisans he usually worked with. One copied the text, another drew the images, and a third bound the book. These hired hands were given contracts which specified precisely what they would have to do and how much money they received for it. From time to time the stationer would come and check on the progress they made.

"<p>The&nbsp;world of professional medieval scribes&nbsp;was shaken up by the coming of Gutenberg&rsquo;s printing press&nbsp;around the middle of the 15th century. The ink pots dried up and the handwritten book slowly turned into an archaic object that was more costly than its printed counterpart.

"<h3>Visiting a bookseller</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The similarities run much further than mere physical traits, however. Take for example the manner in which the book was made and acquired from the 13th century onwards. If you wanted a book in the later Middle Ages you went to a store, as in our modern day. However, the bookseller did not normally have any books in stock&mdash;except for perhaps some second-hand copies. You would tell him what you wanted, both content-wise and with respect to the object&rsquo;s material features. You could specify, for example, that he use paper (instead of parchment), cursive script (and not book script) and add miniatures (or forego&nbsp;decoration). Just like so many other objects you bought in late-medieval society, the commercially-made manuscript was custom-tailored to the individual who purchased it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The professionals who made books for profit were usually found near the biggest church in town. This was a well-chosen spot as canons and clerics (i.e. people who visited the church and who could read) formed an important part of the clientele. By the 14th century true communities of the book had formed in the neighborhoods around churches and cathedrals. Evidence from such cities as Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, London and Paris suggests that in these communities a diverse group of artisans interacted with clients and with each other. It was a world bound not only by the book, however, but also by profit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>Marketing</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Whether you were scribe, illuminator or binder, as a professional you would strive for quality and diversity as this ensured bread and butter on the table. In parallel to our modern book business, medieval manuscript artisans used various marketing strategies to attract new clientele. The most striking of these is advertisements. Scribes hung large sheets outside their doors to show what kind of scripts they had mastered. The short writing samples found on these sheets were often accompanied by the names of the scripts, which shows just how professional the world of the book had become. A particularly rich specimen survives from the shop of Herman Strepel, a professional scribe in M&uuml;nster (c. 1447). In the true spirit of medieval marketing he wrote the names of all the scripts in golden letters on his advertisement sheet.</p>\n"

"\n"
"<p>Scribes also included advertisements in books they had copied for a client. An example of such &ldquo;spam&rdquo; is found in a French manuscript made in Paris by a scribe who calls himself Herneis. On the last page of the book he writes, &ldquo;If someone else would like such a handsome book, come and look me up in Paris, across the Notre Dame cathedral.&rdquo; Herneis and his fellow bookmen lived and worked in the Rue Neuve Notre Dame, which served as the center of commercially-made vernacular books. Similarly, students were served in the Rue St Jacques, on the Left Bank, where the latest Latin textbooks were on offer. For Parisians and students it was handy to have all the professionals in one street: you knew where to go when you needed a book and it was easy to check out who was available for making one for you.</p>\n"

It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios. "
msgstr "A álgebra é a língua através da qual descrevemos padrões. Pensa nela como o método mais eficiente da Matemática. Em vez de termos de fazer os mesmos cálculos repetidamente, a álgebra permite-nos descobrir padrões e expressar processos repetitivos de uma só vez. A álgebra também é vista como uma disciplina \"sagrada\". Quando consegues perceber álgebra, toda a Matemática (mesmo a de nível mais alto) parcer-te-á muito mais  acessível. A álgebra é usada por pessoas de diferentes profissões, desde carpinteiros a engenheiros e designers de moda. Nestas aulas vamos abordar vários assuntos, incluindo equações lineares, inequações lineares, funções lineares, sistemas de equações, fatorização de expressões, polinómios de segundo grau, potências, funções e razões.

Os pais do cálculo dos dias de hoje, Isaac Newton e Gottfried Leibniz, formularam o teorema fundamental do cálculo que nos permite relacionar derivadas com integrais.

Many times, a function can be undefined at a point, but we can think about what the function \"approaches\" as it gets closer and closer to that point (this is the \"limit\").  Other times, the function may be defined at a point, but it may approach a different limit.  There are many, many times where the function value is the same as the limit at a point.  Either way, this is a powerful tool as we start thinking about slope of a tangent line to a curve.\n"

"Os limites são, sem qualquer dúvida, a ferramenta mais importante do cálculo. Na maioria das vezes, uma função pode não estar definida num ponto, mas nós podemos pensar nela como \"estando a tender para algum valor\" à medida que a função se aproxima de um determinado ponto ao qual chamamos \"limite\". Também é muito frequente que o valor da função num ponto seja igual ao limite da função nesse ponto. De qualquer forma, os limites revelam-se sempre uma ferramenta muito útil quando queremos calcular o declive de uma reta tangente ao gráfico de uma função.\n"
